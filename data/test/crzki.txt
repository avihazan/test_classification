procedure; or (iii) by tendering shares of Common Stock or Class A Preferred Stock of the Company acceptable to the Committee valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.   
  
4.3 Treatment of Special Retirement.  
  
a) If Optionee is an Executive Officer and has met the provisions of subsection (iii) of the definition of the term “Special Retirement” in Section 1 above, or if Optionee is a director of the Company and has met the provisions of subsection (iv) of the definition of the term “Special Retirement” in Section 1 above, the right to exercise this Option shall continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 4.1 above.

4.4 Treatment of Death or Permanent Disability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Optionee is an employee, director or consultant of the Company or an Affiliate and ceases to be affiliated with the Company or any Affiliate as a result of Optionee’s death or Permanent Disability, or if Optionee’s death or Permanent Disability occurs following a Special Retirement, any unvested portion of this Option shall accelerate and become fully exercisable. Following Optionee’s death, this Option may be exercised only by the executor or administrator of the Optionee’s estate or, if there is none, the person entitled to exercise the Option under Optionee’s will or the laws of descent and distribution.

If Optionee is an employee of the Company or an Affiliate and is on a leave of absence pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Administrative Policy No. SH-1 “Unpaid Leave” or similar policy maintained by an Affiliate, as such policies may be revised from time to time, Optionee shall not, during the period of such absence be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated Optionee’s employment. Optionee shall continue to vest in this Option during any approved medical or military leave of absence. Medical leave shall include family or medical leaves, workers’ compensation leave, or pregnancy disability leave. For all other leaves of absence, this Option will vest only during active employment and shall not vest during a leave of absence, unless required under local law. However, if Optionee returns to active employment with the Company or an Affiliate following such a leave, this Option will be construed to vest as if there had been no break in active employment. During any leave of absence, Optionee shall have the right to exercise the vested portion of this Option provided that such exercise occurs prior to the Expiration Date.   
  
5. TERMINATION OF OPTION; EVENTS IMPACTING ABILITY TO EXERCISE OPTION.  
  
5.1 Termination of Affiliation. If Optionee is an employee, director or consultant of the Company or an Affiliate and ceases to be affiliated with the Company or an Affiliate for any reason other than death, Special Retirement, Permanent Disability or Cause, Optionee may exercise this Option within the ninety (90) day period following such cessation of affiliation, but only to the extent that this Option was exercisable at the date of such cessation of affiliation and Optionee’s rights to exercise the Option have not been suspended as of the date of such cessation of affiliation.

If the Company terminates the unvested portion of this Option during Special Retirement as a result of Optionee’s Breach of Obligation, Optionee may exercise this Option within the ninety (90) day period following such termination, but only to the extent that this Option was exercisable at the date of such termination.

9.2

Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the right to exercise this Option pursuant to the schedule set forth in Section 4 is earned only by continuing as an employee or consultant at the will of the Company or as a director (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Option or any other Option, award or benefit or acquiring shares hereunder) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to
