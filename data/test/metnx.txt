Thereafter, the Company shall have no further obligations to the Employee except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement or as required by law, provided any such termination shall not adversely affect or alter the Employee's rights under any employee benefit plan of the Company in which the Employee, at the Date of Termination, has a vested interest, unless otherwise provided in such employee benefit plan or any agreement or other instrument attendant thereto.

16.

Compliance With Code Section 409A.  
  
  


(a) Notwithstanding Section 4 of this Agreement, for purposes of determining the timing and application of Code Section 409A to amounts payable upon termination of the Employee’s employment with the Company, the Date of Termination shall mean the date of the Employee’s “separation from service” as such term is defined under Code Section 409A. Each payment and each installment of any severance payments provided for under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of application of Code Section 409A. Subsection (c) below shall not apply to that portion of any amounts payable upon termination of employment which shall qualify as “involuntary severance” under Code Section 409A because such amount (i) does not exceed the lesser of (1) two hundred percent (200%) of the Employee’s annualized compensation from the Company for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the termination of employment occurs, or (2) two hundred percent (200%) of the annual limitation amount under Code Section 401(a)(17) (the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken into account for purposes of a tax-qualified retirement plan) for the calendar year during which termination of employment occurs, and (ii) is paid no later than the end of the second calendar year commencing after termination of employment. 

  


(b) All payments to Employee determined to come within the definition of “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A (“409A Payment”) are intended to comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A, and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. Neither party individually, nor in combination may accelerate, offset or assign any 409A Payment, except in compliance with Code Section 409A, and no amount shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it is permitted to be paid under Code Section 409A. Employee shall have no discretion with respect to the timing of payments except as permitted under Code Section 409A. In the event that the Employee is determined to be a “specified employee” (as defined and determined under Code Section 409A) of Company at a time when its stock is deemed to be publicly traded on an established securities market, 409A Payments payable by reason of separation from service shall be paid no earlier than (i) the 

  


* * *

  


first day of the seventh (7th) calendar month commencing after separation from service, or (ii) the Employee’s death, consistent with and to the extent necessary to meet the requirements Code Section 409A without the imposition of penalty taxes. Any 409A Payments which are subject to execution of a waiver and release which may be executed and/or revoked in a calendar year following the calendar year in which the payment event (such as termination of employment) occurs shall commence payment only in the calendar year in which the release revocation period ends as necessary to comply with Code Section 409A. Any payment delayed by reason of this subsection (c) shall be paid out in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under Code Section 409A in order to catch up to the original specified payment schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment may be made to this Agreement if it would cause the Agreement or any payment hereunder not to be in compliance with Code Section 409A.

  


(c) All benefit plans, programs and policies sponsored by the Company are intended to comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A or to be structured so as to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. All expense reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement or, unless otherwise specified in an applicable program or policy, to the extent subject to Code Section 409A, shall comply with the following rules: (i) any such expense reimbursement shall be made by the Company no later than the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expense was incurred, (ii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year; provided, that the foregoing clause shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect. It is the intent of the Company that the provisions of this Agreement and all other plans and programs sponsored by the Company be interpreted to comply in all respects with Code Section 409A, however, the Company shall have no liability to the Employee, or any successor or beneficiary thereof, in the event taxes, penalties or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any payment or benefit received by the Employee or any successor or beneficiary thereof, nor for reporting in good faith any payment or benefit as subject to Code Section 409A.
