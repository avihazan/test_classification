##### 

(d) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Section, a “Change of Control” shall be considered to have occurred if (i) the stockholders of Employer have approved a merger, consolidation or dissolution of Employer or a sale, lease, exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of Employer’s assets and such transaction has been closed; (ii) less than 75% of the members of the Board shall be individuals who were members of the Board on the Effective Date or whose election or nomination was approved by a vote of at least 75% of the members of the Board then still in office who were either members of the Board on the Effective Date or whose election or nomination was so approved; or (iii) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) shall have become “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) directly or indirectly of securities of Employer representing 40% or more (calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3) of the aggregate voting power of Employer’s then outstanding voting securities. 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, at any time after the Control Change Date, Employer may terminate the employment of Employee without Cause (the “Termination”), but within five days of the Termination, it shall pay to Employee his full Base Salary through the Termination, to the extent not theretofore paid, plus a lump sum amount (the “Special Severance Payment”) equal to the product (discounted to the then present value on the basis of a rate of 7.5% per annum) of his annual Base Salary specified in Section 3 hereof multiplied by the number of years and any portion thereof remaining in the Three-Year Period (or if the remaining term in the Three-Year Period after the Termination is less than two years, for two years — the “Extended Period”). Specified Benefits to which Employee was entitled immediately prior to Termination shall continue until the end of the Three Year Period (or the Extended Period, if applicable); provided that: (i) if any plan pursuant to which Specified Benefits are provided immediately prior to Termination would not permit continued participation by Employee after Termination, then Employer shall pay to Employee within five days after Termination a lump sum payment equal to the amount of Specified Benefits Employee would have received if Employee had been fully vested an a continuing participant in such plan to the end of the Three-Year Period or the Extended Period, if applicable; and (ii) if Employee obtains new employment following Termination, then following any waiting period applicable to participation in any plan of the new employer, Employee shall continue to be entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this sentence only to the extent such benefits would exceed those available to Employee under comparable plans of the Employee’s new employer (but Employee shall not be required to repay any amounts then already received by him). 

(f) Resignation following a Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control of Employer, thereafter, for “good reason” (as defined below), Employee may, at any time during the Three Year Period, in his sole discretion, on not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice and effective at the end of such notice period, resign his employment with Employer (the “Resignation”). Within five days of such a Resignation, Employer shall pay to Employee his full Base Salary through the effective date of such Resignation, to the extent not theretofore paid, plus a lump sum amount equal to the Special Severance Payment (computed as provided in the first sentence of Section 8(e), except that for purposes of such computation all references to “Termination” shall be deemed to be references to “Resignation”).

Resignation of Employee, Specified Benefits to which Employee was entitled immediately prior to Resignation shall continue on the same terms and conditions as provided in Section 8(e) in the case of Termination (including equivalent payments provided for therein).

Only upon expiration of the ten (10) day time period, if Employee believes that Employer has not sufficiently cured the alleged breach may Employee issue the notice of Resignation for “good reason” described above). 

(g) Mitigation and Expenses.

(i) Other Employment. After the Control Change Date, Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and except as expressly set forth herein no such other employment, if obtained, or compensation or benefits payable in connection therewith shall reduce any amounts or benefits to which Employee is entitled hereunder. 

(ii) Expenses. If any dispute should arise under this Agreement after the Control Change Date involving an effort by Employee to protect, enforce or secure rights or benefits claimed by Employee hereunder, Employer shall pay (promptly upon demand by Employee accompanied by reasonable evidence of incurrence) all reasonable expenses (including attorney’s fees) incurred by Employee in connection with such dispute, without regard to whether Employee prevails in such dispute except that Employee shall repay Employer any amounts so received if a court having jurisdiction shall make a final, non-appealable determination that Employee acted frivolously or in bad faith by such dispute 

(h) Successors in Interest. The rights and obligations of Employer and Employee under this Section 8 shall inure to the benefit of and be binding in each and every respect upon the direct and indirect successors and assigns of Employer and Employee, regardless of the manner in which such successors or assigns shall succeed to the interest of Employer or Employee hereunder and this Section 8 shall not be terminated by the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of Employer or any merger or consolidation or acquisition involving

If any dispute cannot be resolved by Employer and Employee, it shall be submitted to arbitration in Kansas City, Missouri, to the exclusion of all other avenues of relief and adjudicated pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Employment Dispute Resolution then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator must be in writing and shall be final and binding on the Parties, and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the losing Party to the arbitration and the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of its or Employee’s own costs and attorney’s fees with respect to the arbitration (except as set forth in Section 8(g)(ii), above. Nothing in this Section 10 shall be construed to derogate Employer’s rights to seek legal and equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction as contemplated by Section 6(h). 

11\. Non-Waiver. It is understood and agreed that one Party’s failure at any time to require the performance by the other Party of any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions hereof shall in no way affect the first Party’s right thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either Party of the breach of any term, provision, covenant or condition hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach. 

12\. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator, such provision shall be deleted from this Agreement and the Agreement shall be construed to give full effect to the remaining provisions thereof. 

13\. Survivability. Unless otherwise provided herein, upon termination or expiration of the Term, the provisions of Sections 6 through 18 hereof shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect but shall under no circumstances extend the Term of this Agreement (or the Employee’s right to accrue additional benefits beyond the expiration of the Term as determined in accordance with Section 1 but without regard to this Section)..
