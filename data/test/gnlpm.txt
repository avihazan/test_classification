10\. Change in Control. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” of the Company shall be defined the same as the conditions for acceleration of an employee’s stock options, pursuant to the Company’s 1993 Stock Option Plan as amended (the “Plan”), or the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock Option Plan (the “New Plan”). In the event of a Change in Control Employee will reasonably cooperate with the Company and exercise his stock options in a way as to not hinder the progress or closing of the transaction, and in no event later than three (3) months following the closing.

11\. Stock Options. All stock options granted at any time to Employee shall vest in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable grant by the Board and, as otherwise may be applicable, with any relevant terms and conditions of the 1993 Stock Option Plan as amended (the “Plan”), to the extent that said options are from the Plan, or, for any options issued out of the New Plan, then pursuant to the New Plan.

12. No Conflicting Agreements. Employee has the right to enter into this Agreement, and hereby confirms Employee has no contractual or other impediments to the performance of Employee’s obligations including, without limitation, any non-competition or similar agreement in favor of any other person or entity.

13. Company Policies. During the term of Employee’s employment, Employee shall engage in no activity or employment which may conflict with the interest of the Company, and Employee shall comply with all policies and procedures of the Company including, without limitation, all policies and procedures pertaining to ethics.

14\. Independent Covenants. The covenants on the part of the Employee contained in Sections 5 and 6 hereof shall be construed as agreements independent of any other provision in this Agreement; it is agreed that the relief for any claim or cause of action of the Employee

8

* * *

  


against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall be measured in damages and shall not constitute a defense to enforcement by the Company of those covenants.

15. Injunctive Relief; Attorneys’ Fees. In recognition of the irreparable harm that a violation by Employee of any of the covenants contained in Sections 5 and 6 hereof would cause the Company, the Employee agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law, an injunction (both temporary and permanent) against such violation or violations may be issued against him or her and every other person and entity concerned thereby, it being the understanding of the parties that both damages and an injunction shall be proper modes of relief and are not to be considered alternative remedies. Employee consents to the issuance of such injunction relief without the posting of a bond or other security. In the event of any such violation, THE EMPLOYEE AGREES TO PAY THE COSTS, EXPENSES AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY IN PURSUING ANY OF ITS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH VIOLATIONS, IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT THEREOF.

16. Notice. Any notice sent by registered mail to the last known address of the party to whom such notice is to be given shall satisfy the requirements of notice in this Agreement.

17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties hereto concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any oral or written existing agreements between the Company and the Employee relating generally to the same subject matter. Company and Employee hereby acknowledge that there are no agreements or understandings of any nature, oral or written, regarding Employee’s employment, apart from this Agreement.

# EXHIBIT A

Executive Bonus Program — F/Y/E 10/31/2002

Employee may earn a percentage of Employee’s base salary as a bonus during fiscal year 2002, which will vary depending on the percentage of Targeted Income before taxes earned by the Company (“Targeted Income”), the amount of which was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors at its November 6, 2001 meeting, as part of the approved FY 2002 budget:

Company Earnings as % of Targeted Income

Bonus  
  
a.

Less than 90%

0  
  
b.

90%

40% of base salary.  
  
c.

90% - 100%

40% of base salary plus an additional 1% of base salary for each increase of 1%   
over 90%.  
  
d.

100%

50% of base salary.  
  
e.

100% - 120%

50% of base salary plus an additional ½ of 1% of base salary for each increase of 1% over 100%.  
  
f.

120%

60% of base salary.  
  
g.

over 120%

60% of base salary plus an additional 1% of base salary for each increase of 1%   
over 120%.  
  
For example, if the Company earns 100% of its Targeted Income during fiscal year 2002, Employee would be paid a performance bonus of 50% of his base salary. If the Company earns 90% of its Targeted Income during fiscal year 2002, Employee would be paid a performance bonus of 40% of his base salary. If the Company earns 120% of its Targeted Income, then Employee’s performance bonus would be 60% of his base salary. If the Company earns more than 120% of its Targeted Income, Employee’s performance bonus would further increase by an amount equal to 1% of his base salary for each percent by which the percentage increase in Targeted Income exceeds 120% of Targeted Income.
