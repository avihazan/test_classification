(d) Purchase for Investment. Buyer is financially able to bear the economic risks of acquiring an interest in the Company and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and have no need for liquidity in this investment. Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters in general, and with respect to businesses of a nature similar to the business of the Company, so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of, and making an informed business decision with regard to, the acquisition of the Shares. Buyer is acquiring the Shares solely for their own account and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution or public offering thereof, within the meaning of any applicable securities laws and regulations, unless such distribution or offering is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an exemption from such registration is available. Buyer has (i) received all the information they have deemed necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the acquisition of the Shares, (ii) had an opportunity to make such investigation as she has desired pertaining to the Company and the acquisition of an interest therein, and to verify the information which is, and has been, made available to her and (iii) had the opportunity to ask questions of Seller concerning the Company. Buyer has received no public solicitation or advertisement with respect to the offer or sale of the Shares. Buyer realizes that the Shares are “restricted securities” as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, the resale of the Shares is restricted by federal and state securities laws and, accordingly, the Shares must be held indefinitely unless their resale is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available for their resale. Buyer understands that any resale of the Shares by her must be registered under the Securities Act (and any applicable state securities law) or be effected in circumstances that, in the opinion of counsel for the Company at the time, create an exemption or otherwise do not require registration under the Securities Act (or applicable state securities laws). Buyer acknowledges and consents that certificates now or hereafter issued for the Shares will bear a legend substantially as follows:

THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR QUALIFIED UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE “STATE ACTS”), HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND QUALIFICATION UNDER THE STATE ACTS OR PURSUANT TO EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF THE SECURITIES ACT, THE EXEMPTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 4(1) OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND RULE 144 THEREUNDER). AS A PRECONDITION TO ANY SUCH TRANSFER, THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES SHALL BE FURNISHED WITH AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OPINING AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION AND/OR SUCH OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY BE SATISFACTORY THERETO THAT ANY SUCH TRANSFER WILL NOT VIOLATE THE SECURITIES LAWS.

E-3

* * *

Buyer understands that the Shares are being sold to her pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(1) of the Securities Act and that Seller is relying upon the representations made herein as one of the bases for claiming the Section 4(1) exemption.

(e) Liabilities. Following the Closing, Seller will have no debts, liabilities or obligations relating to the Company or its business or activities, whether before or after the Closing, and there are no outstanding guaranties, performance or payment bonds, letters of credit or other contingent contractual obligations that have been undertaken by Seller directly or indirectly in relation to the Company or its business and that may survive the Closing.

(f) Title to Purchase Price Shares. Buyer is the sole record and beneficial owner of the Purchase Price Shares. At Closing, Buyer will have good and marketable title to the Purchase Price Shares, which Purchase Price Shares are, and at the Closing will be, free and clear of all options, warrants, pledges, claims, Liens and encumbrances, and any restrictions or limitations prohibiting or restricting transfer to Seller, except for restrictions on transfer as contemplated by applicable securities laws.

(g) Capitalization. As of the date hereof, Seller owns the Shares, which interests represent 100% of the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company. The Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid, non-assessable and free and clear of any Liens.

5\. Indemnification and Release.

(a) Indemnification. Buyer covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Seller, and its officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives and affiliates (collectively, together with Seller, the “Seller Indemnified Parties”) at all times from and after the date of this Agreement from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, adjustments, costs and expenses (including specifically, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses of investigation), whether or not involving a third party claim and regardless of any negligence of any Seller Indemnified Party (collectively, “Losses”), incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party as a result of or arising from (i) any breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth herein or in certificates delivered in connection herewith, (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer under this Agreement, (iii) any debt, liability or obligation of the Company, whether incurred or arising prior to the date hereof or after, (iv) any debt, liability or obligation of Seller for actions taken prior to that certain share exchange transaction by the Seller with the shareholders of Taiyu Machinery & Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd (the “Share Exchange”), including, without limitation, any amounts due or owing to any former officer, director or Affiliate of Seller, (v) the conduct and operations of the business of the Company whether before or after the Closing, (vi) claims asserted against the Company whether arising before or after the Closing, or (vii) any federal or state income tax payable by Seller and attributable to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or activities prior to the Share Exchange or with respect to the Company after the Share Exchange.

* * *

(b) Third Party Claims.

(i) If any claim or liability (a “Third-Party Claim”) should be asserted against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties (the “Indemnitee”) by a third party after the Closing for which Buyer has an indemnification obligation under the terms of Section 5(a), then the Indemnitee shall notify Buyer (the “Indemnitor”) within 20 days after the Third-Party Claim is asserted by a third party (said notification being referred to as a “Claim Notice”) and give the Indemnitor a reasonable opportunity to take part in any examination of the books and records of the Indemnitee relating to such Third-Party Claim and to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim and in connection therewith and to conduct any proceedings or negotiations relating thereto and necessary or appropriate to defend the Indemnitee and/or settle the Third-Party Claim. The expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of all negotiations, proceedings, contests, lawsuits or settlements with respect to any Third-Party Claim shall be borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor agrees to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim in writing within 20 days after the Claim Notice of such Third-Party Claim has been delivered, through counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee, then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to control the conduct of such defense, and shall be responsible for any expenses of the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim so long as the Indemnitor continues such defense until the final resolution of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall be responsible for paying all settlements made or judgments entered with respect to any Third-Party Claim the defense of which has been assumed by the Indemnitor. Except as provided in subsection (ii) below, both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee must approve any settlement of a Third-Party Claim. A failure by the Indemnitee to timely give the Claim Notice shall not excuse Indemnitor from any indemnification liability except only to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.

(ii) If the Indemnitor shall not agree to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim in writing within 20 days after the Claim Notice of such Third-Party Claim has been delivered, or shall fail to continue such defense until the final resolution of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnitee may defend against such Third-Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and the Indemnitee may settle such Third-Party Claim, in its sole discretion, on such terms as it may deem appropriate. The Indemnitor shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of all settlement payments and expenses, legal and otherwise, incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim. If no settlement of such Third-Party Claim is made, then the Indemnitor shall satisfy any judgment rendered with respect to such Third-Party Claim before the Indemnitee is required to do so, and pay all expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the Indemnitee in the defense against such Third-Party Claim.

(c) Non-Third-Party Claims. Upon discovery of any claim for which Buyer has an indemnification obligation under the terms of this Section 5 which does not involve a claim by a third party against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall give prompt notice to Buyer of such claim and, in any case, shall give Buyer such notice within 30 days of such discovery. A failure by Indemnitee to timely give the foregoing notice to Buyer shall not excuse Buyer from any indemnification liability except to the extent that Buyer is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.
