The Option may be exercised by delivering to the Treasurer of the Company at its principal office, 5885 Landerbrook Dr., Cleveland, OH 44124, a completed Notice of Exercise of Option (obtainable from the Treasurer of the Company) setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised. Such Notice shall be accompanied by payment in full for the Shares. Such payment shall be made by certified or cashier’s check payable to the Company in the amount of the aggregate purchase price for such Shares, or, if permitted by the Committee, in whole or in part in Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the Option is exercised equal to that portion of the purchase price for which payment in cash is not made, or by any other method prescribed by the Committee that it determines to be consistent with applicable law and the purposes of the Plan. 

9\. Issuance of Share Certificates. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 9 and to Sections 16 and 17, upon receipt by the Company prior to expiration of the Option of a duly completed Notice of Exercise of Option to exercise the Option accompanied by full payment for the Shares being purchased pursuant to such Notice (and, with respect to any Option exercised pursuant to Section 6 or Section 11 hereof by someone other than the Optionee, accompanied in addition by proof satisfactory to the Committee of the right of such person to exercise the Option), the Company shall promptly cause to be made or otherwise delivered to the Optionee, a certificate for the number of shares so purchased. The Optionee shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares which are subject to the Option unless and until a certificate representing such Shares is issued to the Optionee. The Company shall not be required to issue any certificates for Shares upon the exercise of an Option granted under the Plan prior to (i) obtaining any approval from any governmental agency which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, (ii) the admission of such Shares to listing on any securities exchange (if any) on which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and (iii) completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state, federal or other law or ruling or regulations of any governmental body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, or the determination by the Committee, in its sole discretion, that any registration or other qualification of the Shares is not necessary or advisable. 

10\. Restrictions on Transfer of Option Shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions contained in this Agreement shall continue to be applicable to the Option Shares following any Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, and no Transfer to a Permitted Transferee may be consummated unless prior thereto the transferor thereof shall have complied with Section 10.3 below. In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, no holder of Option Shares may avoid the provisions of this Agreement by making one or more transfers to one or more Permitted Transferees and then disposing of all or any portion of such Person’s interest in any such Permitted Transferee, and any Transfer or attempted Transfer in violation of this covenant shall be void and otherwise subject to Section 10.3 below.

5 

* * *

10.4 Termination. The restrictions on the Transfer of Option Shares set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.3, and the legend requirement set forth in Section 10.6, shall expire and terminate with respect to each Option Share upon the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering, (ii) the occurrence of a Change of Control, (iii) the consummation of an Approved Sale (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement), or (iv) such time as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that such restrictions shall cease to apply. 

10.5 Resales of Option Shares. In addition to the restrictions imposed above, no holder of Option Shares shall, directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise Transfer any Option Shares during the seven days prior to and the 180-day period beginning on the effective date of the Company’s initial primary Public Offering (i.e., the initial Public Offering for the Company’s own account) consummated after the date hereof, any underwritten Demand Registration or any underwritten Piggyback Registration (as such terms are defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) (except as part of such underwritten registration), unless the underwriters managing such registered Public Offering otherwise agree in writing. 

10.6 Legend.

A COPY OF SUCH STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE COMPANY TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE COMPANY’S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.” 

The legend set forth above shall be promptly removed from the certificates evidencing any Option Shares for which the restrictions contained in Sections 10.1 and 10.3 have terminated in accordance with Section 10.4 hereof. 

11\. Successors in Interest, Etc. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company and the heirs, estate, and Personal Representative of the Optionee. The Option shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Option may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee provided that a guardian or other legal representative who has been duly appointed for such Optionee may exercise the Option on behalf of the Optionee. A deceased Optionee’s Personal Representative shall act in the place and stead of the deceased Optionee with respect to exercising an Option or taking any other action pursuant to this Agreement.

* * *

12\. Provisions of Plan Control. This Agreement is subject to all of the terms, conditions, and provisions of the Plan and to such rules, regulations, and interpretations relating to the Plan as may be adopted by the Committee and as may be in effect from time to time. A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by reference. In the event and to the extent that this Agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the terms, conditions, and provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall control, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be modified accordingly. Any action or determination that may be taken or made by the Committee under this Agreement alternatively may be taken or made by the Board of Directors of the Company, which shall be deemed to act as the “Committee” for purposes of this Agreement in so taking or making any such action or determination. 

13\. No Liability Upon Distribution of Shares.

14\. Withholding. The Optionee agrees that the Company and any Affiliate of the Company may make appropriate provision for tax withholding with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including such withholding as may be appropriate with respect to income and social security taxes. Optionee must, no later than the date as of which the value of the Option first becomes includible in the gross income of the Optionee for income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law or other amounts to be withheld with respect to the Option. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement are conditioned on such payment, and the Company, to the extent permitted by law, has the right to deduct any such taxes or other amounts from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 

15\. Voluntary Award. The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Option granted hereunder is granted on a voluntary basis and without creating legal rights on the part of the Optionee for the future. 

16\. Compliance with Regulatory Matters. The Optionee acknowledges that the issuance of capital stock is subject to limitations imposed by federal and state law, and the Optionee hereby agrees that the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Option that would cause the Company to violate any rule, regulation, order or consent decree of any regulatory authority (including without limitation the Securities and Exchange Commission and the principal securities exchange (if any) upon which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted) having jurisdiction over the affairs of the Company. The Optionee agrees that he will provide 

7 

* * *

the Company with such information as is reasonably requested by the Company or its counsel to determine whether the issuance of shares of Common Stock complies with the provisions described by this Section 16. 

17\. Investment Representation. The Optionee hereby represents and warrants that any Shares which he may acquire by virtue of the exercise of the Option shall be acquired solely for his own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to distribution or resale; provided, however, that this restriction shall become inoperative in the event the Shares which are subject to the Option shall be registered under the Securities Act, part of a class of shares registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and exempt from the registration requirements of applicable state securities laws, or in the event there is presented to the Company an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the offer or sale of the Shares which are subject to the Option may lawfully be made without registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Optionee agrees to sign a certificate to such effect at the time of exercising the Option and agrees that the certificate for the Shares so purchased may be inscribed with the following legend to ensure compliance with the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws: 

“THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SHARES HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE AND ANY APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE SECURITIES LAWS ARE MET, OR UNLESS THE STOCKHOLDER ESTABLISHES TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE CORPORATION THAT AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.” 

18\. Restricted Securities. The Optionee understands and acknowledges that (a) as of the date of grant, none of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, (b) unless so registered, all of the Shares will constitute “restricted securities” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (c) the Shares may not be transferred unless they become registered under the Securities Act or unless the holder thereof establishes to the satisfaction of the Company that an exemption from such registration is available, (d) the Company will have no obligation to provide any such registration or take such steps as are necessary to permit sale of the Shares without registration pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise, (e) at such time as the Shares may be disposed of in routine sales without registration in reliance on Rule 144 under the Securities Act, such disposition may be made only in such amounts and in accordance with all of the terms and conditions applicable under Rule 144, and (f) if the Rule 144 exemption is not available, compliance with some other exemption from registration will be required.
