The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of 17 months (the “Initial Term”) commencing as of July 29, 2010(“Commencement Date”), unless Employee’s employment terminates prior thereto, as provided in Paragraphs 6 and 7. Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically for successive periods of one (1) year unless either party shall give the other at least 60 days prior written notice of its intent not to renew, whereupon it shall terminate as of the expiration of the then existing term. Any renewal terms shall also be subject to termination as provided in Paragraph 6 and 7. On an annual basis following the Initial Term, the Board of Directors will conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and review of Employee’s performance for purposes of determining whether to extend this Agreement.

7\. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. 

(a) As of the effective date of the termination of this Agreement, the Corporation shall have no further obligation to pay any further salary to the Employee hereunder (except the annual salary shall be prorated to the date of termination) or any other benefits hereunder and the Employee shall have no further obligation to perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder, other than the covenant not to compete contained in Paragraph 8 hereof.

(c) To the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the Employee’s termination of active employment shall be construed to require a “Separation from Service” as defined in Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, such that the Corporation and Employee reasonably anticipate that the level of bona fide services Employee would perform after termination would permanently decrease to a level that is less than 50% of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36-month period.
