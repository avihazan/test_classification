(b) Beneficiary Designation. The Participant may name a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive any Restricted Stock that is settled after the Participant’s death. Each designation made will revoke all prior designations, must be made on a form prescribed by the Committee and will be effective only when filed in writing with the Committee. If the Participant has not made an effective Beneficiary designation, the Beneficiary will be the Participant’s surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the Participant’s estate.  
(c) Transferring the Restricted Stock. Except to the extent the Committee permits otherwise, the Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, as described in Section 8(b), the Participant may designate a beneficiary to receive the Restricted Stock if the Participant dies before the Restricted Stock is settled.  
(d) Governing Law. This Award Agreement will be construed in accordance with, and governed by the laws (other than laws governing conflicts of laws) of, the State of Ohio. In the event of any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Award Agreement, the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas Court of the State of Ohio (Summit County) or The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.  
(e) Restricted Stock Subject to Plan. The Restricted Stock is subject to the terms and conditions described in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Award Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan will govern. The Committee has the sole responsibility of interpreting the Plan and this Award Agreement, and its determination of the meaning of any provision in the Plan or this Award Agreement will be binding on the Participant. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Award Agreement have the same meanings as in the Plan.  
(f) Other Agreements. The Restricted Stock and this Award Agreement will be subject to the terms of any other written agreements between the Participant and the Company and any Related Entity to the extent that those other agreements do not directly conflict with the terms of the Plan or this Award Agreement.

(h) Acknowledgement; Return of Agreement. This Award Agreement (and the Restricted Stock) automatically will be revoked unless the Participant signs the acknowledgement appearing at the end of this Award Agreement and returns a copy of the signed Award Agreement to the Committee no later than 30 days after the Grant Date.

consent of any governmental body is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of the Restricted Stock, the Restricted Stock may not be issued in whole or in part unless and until that listing, registration, qualification or approval has been obtained, free of any conditions which are not acceptable to the Board and the sale and delivery of stock under this Award Agreement is also subject to the same requirements and conditions.  
(j) Signature in Counterparts. This Award Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.  
(k) Section 83(b) Election. The Participant may file an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed currently on the Fair Market Value of the shares of Restricted Stock (less any purchase price paid for the Restricted Stock). The election will be made on a form provided by the Company and must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service no later than 30 days after the Grant Date. The Participant must seek the advice of the Participant’s own tax advisors as to the advisability of making such an election, the potential consequences of making such an election, the requirements for making such an election, and the other tax consequences of the Restricted Stock under federal, state, and any other laws, rules and regulations that may be applicable.
