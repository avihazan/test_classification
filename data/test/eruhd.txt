2.1 Term. The term of employment under this Agreement shall be three (3) years (the “Initial Term”), commencing on the date of the Agreement. This Agreement may be renewed by mutual agreement of the two parties for subsequent one-year terms as agreed by the parties (each a “Renewal Term”). The Initial Term and any Renewal Terms shall herein be referred to as the “Employment Term”.

2.2 Termination. The Employment Term and employment of Employee may be terminated as follows:

(a) By the Company immediately for “Cause.” For the purpose of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean: (i) conduct amounting to fraud, embezzlement, or illegal misconduct in connection with Employee’s duties under this Agreement; (ii) the conviction of Employee by a court of proper jurisdiction of (or his or her written, voluntary and freely given confession to) a crime which constitutes a felony (other than a traffic violation) or an indictment that results in material injury to the Company’s property, operation or reputation; (iii) the willful failure of Employee to comply with reasonable directions of the Company or any of the policies of the Company after (A) written notice is delivered to the Employee describing such willful failure and (B) Employee has failed to cure or take substantial steps to cure such willful failure after a reasonable time period (not to be less than 15 days) unless the Employee, after discussion with counsel, in good faith believes, that the directions of the Company (or its actions or inactions in response to the Employee’s written notice) are illegal; or (iv) willful misconduct or a material default by the Employee in the performance or observance of any promise or undertaking of Employee under this Agreement, which willful misconduct or default has continued for a period of ten (10) business days after written notice thereof from the Company to the Employee.

During a period of disability prior to termination hereunder, Employee shall continue to receive his or her full compensation (including base salary and bonus) and benefits, subject to offset to the extent of any disability insurance payments received by the Employee pursuant to any disability insurance policy maintained by or paid for by the Company.

(d) By the Employee upon ten (10) business days notice to the Company for Good Reason, which notice shall state the reason for termination. For the purpose of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean any (i) “Change in Control” (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) any material failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of this Employment Agreement, including but not limited to, failure to timely pay any part of Employee’s compensation (including salary or bonus) or provide the benefits contemplated herein, or (iii) failure by the Company to perform any of its material obligations under the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 6, 2006 between the Company, Capital Growth Systems, Inc., Global Capacity Merger Sub, Inc., Employee and John Abraham (the “Merger Agreement”) and which is not remedied by the Company within ten (10) business days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from Employee; provided, that if such default is of a nature that it cannot be reasonably cured within ten (10) day period (but is curable), then if the Company shall have commenced an attempt to cure such default within such ten (10) day period, the period to cure the default shall be extended until the earlier of the date which is forty-five (45) days after receipt of notice or the Company has failed to diligently continue its efforts in a reasonable manner to cure its default.

For purposes hereof, the term “Change in Control” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:

(1)

the Company: (a) consummates a merger or consolidation which results in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company of such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; and (b) following such event, the successor entity fails to employ Employee as follows (hereinafter, the “Same Terms”): on substantially identical terms as are required per this Agreement for the remaining Employment Term, and the successor entity further continues to employ Employee in the same city and with job responsibilities of a level substantially equivalent to or greater than those presently in force and effect;  
  
(2)

a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of (in one transaction or a series of transactions) all or substantially all of the Company’s assets is

consummated, and following such event the successor entity (if any) fails to employ Employee on the Same Terms; or

(3)

Company consummates a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, and following such event the successor entity (if any) fails to employ Employee on the Same Terms;  
  
provided, however, that a public offering of the stock of the Company irrespective of the amount of voting securities owned by present shareholders after such offering shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of Control; and provided further that if Employee agrees to be employed by a successor entity on the Same Terms and the successor entity fails to do so, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred. 

(e) By the Employee without Good Reason, and therefore in breach of this Agreement.

(f) Upon reasonable written notice to the Company, Employee shall be allowed to take a one-time leave of absence from the Company for up to six months, without pay, at any time during the Initial Term, and such leave of absence will not be considered grounds for termination with Cause.

2.3 Cessation of Rights and Obligations: Survival of Certain Provisions. On the date of expiration or earlier termination of the Employment Term for any reason, all of the respective rights, duties, obligations and covenants of the parties, as set forth herein, shall, except as specifically provided herein to the contrary, cease and become of no further force or effect as of the date of said termination, and shall only survive as expressly provided for herein.

2.4 Cessation of Compensation. In lieu of any severance under any severance plan that the Company may then have in effect, and subject to (i) the receipt of a full and unconditional release from Employee and (ii) any amounts owed by the Employee to the Company under any contract, agreement or loan document entered into after the date hereof which relates solely to his or her employment with the Company (including, but not limited to, loans made by the Company to the Employee), the Company shall pay to the Employee, and the Employee shall be entitled to receive, the following amounts within thirty (30) days of the date of a termination of his or her employment:

(a) Voluntary Termination/Cause/Expiration of Term. Upon (i) Employee terminating his or her employment without Good Reason as provided in Section 2.2(e), (ii) the expiration of the Employment Term because the Employee or the Company elects to not extend the Employment Term, or (iii) a termination of the Employment Term for Cause by the Company as provided in Section 2.2(a), the Employee shall be entitled to receive his or her or her base salary (which shall include any of his or her unused vacation pay for the year of such termination) and expense reimbursements solely through the date of termination.

-4-

* * *

(b) Death or Total Disability. Upon the termination of the Employment Term by reason of the Death or Total Disability of the Employee, the Employee (or, in the case of Death, his or her estate) shall be entitled to receive his or her base salary (which shall include any of his or her unused vacation pay for the year of such termination) and expense reimbursements solely through the date of termination.

(c) Involuntary. Upon the termination of the Employment Term: by the Employee for Good Reason, the Employee shall be entitled to receive in a lump sum the balance of his or her base salary for the lesser of the remaining term of the Employment Term (exclusive of any renewals of the then existing term) or a period of six (6) months (the “Severance Term”), together with prorated vacation pay and expense reimbursement through the date of termination. In addition, Employee shall be entitled to payment by the Company of the premiums for group health insurance coverage otherwise payable by Employee under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”) for the Severance Term. It shall be a condition to Employee’s right to receive the payments described above that Employee shall be in compliance with all of the Employee’s obligations which survive termination hereof, including without limitation those arising under Articles IV and V hereof. The payments described above are intended to be in lieu of all other payments to which Employee might otherwise be entitled in respect of termination of Employee’s employment without Cause unless otherwise required by law or under other agreements between the parties. 

2.5 Business Expenses.

(a) Reimbursement. The Company shall reimburse the Employee for all reasonable, ordinary, and necessary business expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the performance of his or her duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, ordinary and necessary travel expenses and entertainment expenses. The reimbursement of business expenses will be governed by the policies of the Company from time-to-time and the terms otherwise set forth herein.

(b) Accounting. The Employee shall provide the Company with an accounting of his or her expenses, which accounting shall clearly reflect which expenses were incurred for proper business purposes in accordance with the policies adopted by the Company and as such are reimbursable by the Company. The Employee shall provide the Company with such other supporting documentation and other substantiation of reimbursable expenses as will conform to Internal Revenue Service or other requirements. All such reimbursements shall be payable by the Company to the Employee within a reasonable time after receipt by the Company of appropriate documentation therefor.

2.6 Sole Compensation. Employee shall not be entitled to any other compensation from the Company than as set forth in Article II hereof as a result of termination of Employee’s employment. The foregoing shall not be construed to limit any rights of Employee to receive the Contingent Consideration under the Merger Agreement.

4.1 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the duties and services to be performed by Employee under this Agreement are special and unique and that as of a result of the employment hereunder, Employee will acquire, develop and use information of a special and unique nature and value that is not generally known to the public or to the Company’s industry, including but not limited to, certain records, phone locations, documentation, software programs, data bases of the Company or its Affiliates, including without limitation, the Magenta data base, proprietary information, price lists, contract prices for purchase and sale of telephone access and telephone services, customer lists, prospect lists, pricing on business proposals to new and existing customers, network configuration, supplier pricing, equipment configurations, business plans, ledgers and general information, employee records, mailing lists, accounts receivable and payable ledgers, financial and other records of the Company or its Affiliates, and other similar matters (all such information being hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information”). Employee further acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is of great value to the Company and its Affiliates and that the restrictions and agreements contained in this Agreement are reasonably necessary to protect the Confidential Information and the goodwill of the Company. Accordingly, Employee hereby agrees that:

(a) Employee will not, while employed by the Company or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, except in connection with Employee’s performance of the duties under this Agreement, or as otherwise authorized in writing by the Company for the benefit of the Company, divulge to any person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, or organization, other than the Company (hereinafter referred to as “Third Parties”), or use or cause or authorize any Third Parties to use, the Confidential Information, except as required by law; and

(b) Upon the termination of Employee’s employment for any reason whatsoever, Employee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company any and all

-6-

* * *

Confidential Information or documents containing Confidential Information, including notes, drawings, notebooks, notes, records, keys, data and other documents and materials belonging to the Company or its affiliates which is in his or her possession or under his or her control relating to the Company or its affiliates, regardless of the medium upon which it is stored, and will deliver to the Company upon such termination of employment any other property of the Company or its Affiliates which is in his or her possession or control.

4.2 Non-Solicitation Covenant. So long as Company is not in default of its obligations to pay Merger Consideration under the Agreement and Plan of Merger signed by the parties on October 6, 2006: Employee hereby covenants and agrees that while employed by the Company and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company for any reason, Employee shall not (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, interfere with, or endeavor to entice away from the Company or its Affiliates any person, firm, corporation, limited liability company or other entity that was a customer of the Company at any time while Employee was an employee of the Company or its Affiliates or who is a “prospective customer” of the Company, or (ii) induce, attempt to induce or hire any employee (or any person who was an employee during the year preceding the date of any solicitation) of the Company or its Affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or its Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such employee and the Company or its Affiliates; provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this clause (ii) shall not prohibit Employee, after termination of Employee’s employment with Company, from retaining a former employee of Company if the former Employee first approached Employee concerning the possibility of working for Employee. For purposes hereof, “prospective customer” shall mean any person or entity which has been solicited for business by Employee or any officer or other employee of the Company during the one year period preceding the date of termination of Employee’s employment with the Company, or if Employee is still employed by the Company within the one year period preceding the event in question.

4.3 Non-Competition Covenant. So long as Company is not in default of its obligations under this Agreement or the Agreement and Plan of Merger: Employee acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section 4.3 are reasonable in scope and essential to the preservation of the Business of the Company (as defined herein). Employee also acknowledges that the enforcement of the covenant set forth in this Section 4.3 will not preclude Employee from being gainfully employed in such manner and to the extent as to provide a standard of living for himself or herself, the members of his or her family and the others dependent upon Employee of at least the level to which Employee and they have become accustomed and may expect. In addition, Employee acknowledges that the Company has obtained an advantage over its competitors as a result of its name, location and reputation that is characterized by near permanent relationships with vendors, customers, principals and other contacts which it has developed at great expense. Furthermore, Employee acknowledges that competition by him or her following the termination or expiration of his or her employment would impair the operation of the Company beyond that which would arise from the competition of an unrelated third party with similar skills. Employee hereby agrees that he or she shall not, during his or her employment and for a period of one (1) year after the end of his or her employment, directly or indirectly, engage in or become directly or indirectly interested in any proprietorship, partnership, firm, trust, company, limited liability company or other entity, other

than the Company (whether as owner, partner, trustee, beneficiary, stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, independent contractor, agent, servant, consultant, lessor, lessee or otherwise) that competes with the Company in the Business of the Company in the Restricted Territory (as defined herein), other than owning an interest in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in an amount which does not exceed five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of such corporation. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term “Business of the Company” shall include all business activities and ventures related to providing telecommunications services or products in which Global Capacity, Inc. is engaged, plans to engage in the next twelve (12) months following termination of Employee’s employment or has engaged in during the prior twelve (12) months, as determined at any time during the employment of the Employee; and (ii) the term “Restricted Territory” means the geographical area consisting of a seventy mile radius surrounding each city (and including such city) in which the Company maintains either an office or a telecommunications facility.

4.4 Remedies.

(a) Injunctive Relief. Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Business of the Company is highly competitive and that a violation of any of the provisions of Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 would cause immediate and irreparable harm, loss and damage to the Company not adequately compensable by a monetary award. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that the time periods and territorial areas provided for herein are the minimum necessary to adequately protect the Business of the Company, the enjoyment of the Confidential Information and the goodwill of the Company. Without limiting any of the other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity, or the Company’s right or ability to collect money damages, Employee agrees that any actual or threatened violation of any of the provisions of Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 may be immediately restrained or enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, and that a temporary restraining order or emergency, preliminary or final injunction may be issued in any court of competent jurisdiction, without notice and without bond.

(b) Enforcement. It is the desire of the parties that the provisions of Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies in each jurisdiction in which enforcement might be sought. Accordingly, if any particular portion of Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 shall ever be adjudicated as invalid or unenforceable, or if the application thereof to any party or circumstance shall be adjudicated to be prohibited by or invalidated by such laws or public policies, such section or sections shall be (i) deemed amended to delete therefrom such portions so adjudicated or (ii) modified as determined appropriate by such a court, such deletions or modifications to apply only with respect to the operation of such section or sections in the particular jurisdictions so adjudicating on the parties and under the circumstances as to which so adjudicated.

(c) Legal Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-prevailing party for all reasonable costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees, incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such enforcement proceedings.
