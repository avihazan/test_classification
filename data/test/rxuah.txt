ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.  



THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of February 20, 2003, between Arch Capital Group Ltd. (the "Company"), a Bermuda company, and Louis T. Petrillo (the "Employee"). 

WHEREAS, the Employee has been granted the following award in connection with his or her retention as an employee and as compensation for services to be rendered; and the following terms reflect the Company's 2002 Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan (the "Plan"); 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows. 

1. Award of Shares. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, the Employee is hereby awarded 1,943 Restricted Shares (the "Award"), subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. 

2. Terms and Conditions. It is understood and agreed that the Award of Restricted Shares evidenced hereby is subject to the following terms and conditions: 

(a) Vesting of Award. Subject to Section 2(b) below and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Award shall become vested in four equal annual installments, commencing on the date hereof and thereafter on the first, second and third anniversaries thereof. Unless otherwise provided by the Company, all dividends and other amounts receivable in connection with any adjustments to the Shares under Section 4(c) of the Plan shall be subject to the vesting schedule in this Section 2(a). 

(b) Termination of Service; Forfeiture of Unvested Shares. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 2(a) above, in the event the Employee ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to the date the Restricted Shares otherwise become vested (i) due to his or her death or Permanent Disability (as defined in the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan) or (ii) due to termination by the Company not for Cause (as defined in the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan), the Restricted Shares shall become immediately vested in full upon such termination of employment. If the Employee ceases to be an Employee of the Company for any other reason prior to the date the Restricted Shares become vested, the Award shall be forfeited by the Employee and become the property of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, service with any of the Company's Subsidiaries (as defined in the Plan) shall be considered to be service with the Company. 

(c) Certificates. Each certificate issued in respect of Restricted Shares awarded hereunder shall be deposited with the Company, or its designee, together with, if requested by the Company, a stock power executed in blank by the Employee, and shall bear a legend disclosing the restrictions on transferability imposed on such Restricted Shares by this Agreement (the "Restrictive Legend"). Upon the vesting of Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and the satisfaction of any withholding tax liability pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the certificates evidencing such vested Shares, not bearing the Restrictive Legend, shall be delivered to the Employee. 

(d) Rights of a Stockholder. Prior to the time a Restricted Share is fully vested hereunder, the Employee shall have no right to transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber such Restricted Share. During such period, the Employee shall have all other rights of a stockholder, including, but not limited to, the right to vote and to receive dividends (subject to Section 2(a) hereof) at the time paid on such Restricted Shares.

(e) No Right to Continued Employment. This Award shall not confer upon the Employee any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company nor shall this Award interfere with the right of the Company to terminate the Employee's employment at any time. 




3. Transfer of Shares. The Shares delivered hereunder, or any interest therein, may be sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered, or transferred or disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part, only in compliance with the terms, conditions and restrictions as set forth in the governing instruments of the Company, applicable United States federal and state securities laws or any other applicable laws or regulations and the terms and conditions hereof. 

4. Expenses of Issuance of Shares. The issuance of stock certificates hereunder shall be without charge to the Employee. The Company shall pay, and indemnify the Employee from and against any issuance, stamp or documentary taxes (other than transfer taxes) or charges imposed by any governmental body, agency or official (other than income taxes) or by reason of the issuance of Shares. 

5. Withholding. No later than the date of vesting of (or the date of an election by the Employee under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to) the Award granted hereunder, the Employee shall pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld at such time with respect to such Award and the Company shall, to the extent permitted or required by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Employee, federal, state and local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld at such time.
