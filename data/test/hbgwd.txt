RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS CORP.  
2009 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN



THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and John Roche (the “Grantee”), dated as of the 20th day of October, 2009.

WHEREAS, the Company maintains the Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) (capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto by the Plan);

WHEREAS, the Grantee is an Eligible Person; and

WHEREAS, in accordance with the Plan, the Committee and the Board have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant Restricted Stock to the Grantee subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

1\. Grant of Restricted Stock.

The Company hereby grants the Grantee fifty thousand (50,000) Shares of Restricted Stock of the Company, subject to the following terms and conditions and subject to the provisions of the Plan. The Plan is hereby incorporated herein by reference as though set forth herein in its entirety. To the extent such terms or conditions conflict with any provision of the Plan, the terms and conditions set forth herein shall govern.

2\. Restrictions and Conditions.

The Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:  
  
(i) Subject to clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) below, the period of restriction with respect to Shares granted hereunder (the “Restriction Period”) shall begin on the date hereof and lapse, if and as employment continues, in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the date hereof.  
  
For purposes of the Plan and this Agreement, Shares with respect to which the Restriction Period has lapsed shall be vested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restriction Period with respect to such Shares shall only lapse as to whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, during the Restriction Period, the Grantee shall not be permitted voluntarily or involuntarily to sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, alienate, encumber or assign the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan (or have such Shares attached or garnished).

(ii) Except as provided in the foregoing clause (i), below in this clause (ii) or in the Plan, the Grantee shall have, in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock, all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive any cash dividends. Shares (not subject to restrictions) shall be delivered to the Grantee or his or her designee promptly after, and only after, the Restriction Period shall lapse without forfeiture in respect of such Shares of Restricted Stock.   
  
(iii) Subject to clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) below, upon the Grantee’s Termination of Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries for Cause or by the Grantee for any reason other than Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement by and between NRDC Acquisition Corp. and the Grantee dated October 20, 2009) during the Restriction Period, then all Shares still subject to restriction shall thereupon, and with no further action, be forfeited by the Grantee.  
  
(iv) In the event the Grantee has a Termination of Service on account of death, or Disability or on account of Termination of Service by the Company for any reason other than for Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason during the Restriction Period, the Restriction Period will immediately lapse on all Restricted Stock granted to the Grantee.   
  
(v) In the event the Grantee has a Termination of Service (other than a Termination of Service by the Company for Cause) within 12 months following a Change of Control during the Restriction Period, the Restriction Period will immediately lapse on all Restricted Stock granted to the Grantee.  
  
(vi) Termination of Service as an employee shall not be treated as a termination of employment for purposes of this Paragraph 2 if the Grantee continues without interruption to serve thereafter as an officer or director of the Company or in such other capacity as determined by the Committee (or if no Committee is appointed, the Board), and the termination of such successor service shall be treated as the applicable termination.   
  
3\. Miscellaneous.  
  
(a)

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW WHICH COULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives.

(c)

Without limiting the Grantee’s rights as may otherwise be applicable in the event of a Change of Control, if the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation or other entity, the Grantee may be required to deposit with the successor corporation the certificates for the stock or securities or the other property that the Grantee is entitled to receive by reason of ownership of Restricted Stock in a manner consistent with the Plan, and such stock, securities or other property shall become subject to the restrictions and requirements imposed under the Plan and this Agreement, and the certificates therefor or other evidence shall bear a legend similar in form and substance to the legend set forth in the Plan.

(d)

The failure of the Grantee or the Company to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement, or to assert any right the Grantee or the Company, respectively, may have under this Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.  
  
(e)

The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding it determines to be required by law.  
  
(f)
