* * *

  


required by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the laws of the State of Minnesota.

Section 2.3. Demand by Shareholder. If a regular meeting of shareholders has not been held during the immediately preceding 15 months, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent or more of all voting shares may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written notice of demand given to the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the corporation. Within 30 days after receipt of the demand by one of those officers, the Board of Directors shall cause a regular meeting of shareholders to be called and held on notice not later than 90 days after receipt of the demand, all at the expense of the corporation. If the Board fails to cause a regular meeting to be called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the regular meeting by giving notice as required by Section 2.8, all at the expense of the corporation.

Section 2.4. Business at Regular Meeting. At each regular meeting of shareholders there shall be an election of qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are due to expire within six months after the date of the meeting. No other particular business is required to be transacted at a regular meeting. Any business appropriate for action by the shareholders may be transacted at a regular meeting.

Section 2.5. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time, by the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, two or more directors, a person authorized in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws to call special meetings, or a shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more of the voting shares.

A shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more the voting shares may demand a special meeting of shareholders by written notice of demand given to the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the corporation and containing the purposes of the meeting. Within 30 days after receipt of the demand by one of those officers, the Board shall cause a special meeting of shareholders to be called and held on notice not later than 90 days after receipt of the demand, all at the expense of the corporation.

Section 2.7. Business at Special Meetings. The business transacted at a special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.

2

* * *

  


Any business transacted at a special meeting that is not included in those stated purposes is voidable by or on behalf of the corporation, unless all of the shareholders have waived notice of the meeting in accordance with Section 2.9.

Section 2.8. Notice of Meeting. Written notice of all meetings of shareholders stating the place, date, and hour of the meeting and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten or more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except that a meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the corporation is located.

Section 2.9. Waiver; Objections. A shareholder may waive notice of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.

Section 2.10. Record Date. The Board of Directors may fix a date not more than 60 days before the date of a meeting of shareholders as the date for the determination of the holders of voting shares entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting. When a date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice and permitted to vote at that meeting of shareholders.

Section 2.11. Certification of Beneficial Owner. A resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present may establish a procedure whereby a shareholder may certify in writing to the corporation that all or a portion of the shares registered in the name of the shareholder are held for the account of one or more beneficial owners. Upon receipt by the corporation of the writing, the persons specified as beneficial owners, rather than the actual shareholder, are deemed the shareholders for the purposes specified in the writing.

Section 2.12. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting present in person or by proxy at the meeting are a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger or smaller proportion or number is provided in the Articles of Incorporation. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to

3

* * *

  


transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum.

Section 2.13. Adjourned Meetings. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting may be adjourned from time to time. If any meeting of the shareholders is adjourned to another time or place, no notice of the date, time, and place of such adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the time of adjournment.

Section 2.14. Majority Vote Required. The shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present, except where a larger proportion or number is required by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the laws of the State of Minnesota.

Section 2.15. Voting by Class. In any case where a class or series of shares is entitled by the Articles of Incorporation, the laws of the State of Minnesota, or the terms of the shares to vote as a class or series, the matter being voted upon must also receive the affirmative vote of the holders of the same proportion of the shares of that class or series as is required pursuant to Section 2.14.

Section 2.16. Voting Power. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or in the terms of the shares, a shareholder has one vote for each share held.

Section 2.17. Jointly Owned Shares. Shares owned by two or more shareholders may be voted by any one of them unless the corporation receives written notice from any one of them denying the authority of that person to vote those shares.

Section 2.18. Registered Shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11 or the laws of the State of Minnesota, the corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof.

Section 2.19. Shareholder Management. The holders of the voting shares of the corporation may, by unanimous affirmative vote, take any action that the Board of Directors is required or permitted to take or that the shareholders are permitted to take after action or approval of the Board.

Section 2.20. Proxies. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote by filing a written appointment of a proxy with an officer of the corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. An appointment of a proxy for shares held jointly by two or more shareholders is valid if signed by any one of them, unless the corporation receives from any one of those shareholders written notice either denying the authority of that person to appoint a proxy or appointing a different proxy.

Section 2.21. Action Without a Meeting. An action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting by written action signed by all of the shareholders entitled to a vote on such action. The written action is effective when it has been signed by all of those shareholders, unless a different time is provided in the written action.

DIRECTORS

Section 3.1. Number and Election. The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more directors. The number of directors shall be determined by the shareholders who shall, at each regular meeting, fix the number of directors and elect the number so fixed. Except as provided in Section 3.2, each director shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualifies or until his earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. Directors shall be natural persons but need not be shareholders.

Section 3.2. Vacancies and New Directorships. Unless different rules for filling vacancies are provided for in the Articles of Incorporation, vacancies on the Board resulting from the death, disqualification, resignation, or removal of a director may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, and vacancies on the Board resulting from newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors serving at the time of the increase. Each director elected to fill a vacancy holds office until a qualified successor is elected by the shareholders at the next regular meeting or special meeting of the shareholders.

Section 3.3. Powers. Except as may otherwise be provided by shareholder control agreements or Section 2.19, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by the

5

* * *

  


Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the laws of the State of Minnesota directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.

Section 3.4. Time and Place of Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held from time to time at any place, within or without the State of Minnesota, that the Board of Directors may select or by any means described in Section 3.5. If the Board of Directors fails to select a place for a meeting, the meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation, except in the case of the first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors which shall be held as provided in Section 3.6.

Section 3.5. Electronic Meetings. A conference among directors by any means of communication through which the directors may simultaneously hear each other during the conference constitutes a board meeting, if the same notice is given of the conference as would be required by Section 3.7 for a meeting, and if the number of directors participating in the conference would be sufficient to constitute a quorum at a meeting. Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes presence in person at the meeting. A director may participate in a board meeting not described above by any means of communication through which the director, other directors so participating, and all directors physically present at the meeting may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes presence in person at the meeting.

Section 3.6. First Meeting. The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held on the day of the regular meeting of the shareholders immediately after the adjournment thereof at the place where the shareholders’ meeting is held, or at such time and place as shall be fixed by the shareholders at the regular meeting, and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary in order to legally constitute the meeting, provided a quorum is present. If such meeting is not held, it may be held at such time and place and in the manner provided for other meetings of the Board of Directors or as specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.

Section 3.7. Other Meetings. Meetings of the Board, except for the first meeting, may be called by a director or by the chief executive officer of the corporation on ten days’ notice to all directors, of the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting. If the date, time, and place of a board meeting have been announced at a previous meeting of the Board, no notice is required.

* * *

  


Section 3.8. Quorum. A majority, or a larger or smaller proportion or number provided in the Articles of Incorporation, of the directors currently holding office present at a meeting is a quorum for the transaction of business.

Section 3.9. Adjourned Meetings. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting may be adjourned from time to time. If any meeting of the Board of Directors is adjourned to another time or place, no notice of such adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the time of adjournment.

Section 3.10. Board Action. The Board shall take action by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present at a duly held meeting, except where the affirmative vote of a larger proportion or number is required by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the laws of the State of Minnesota. If the Articles of Incorporation require a larger proportion or number than is required by the laws of the State of Minnesota for a particular action, the Articles of Incorporation shall control.

Section 3.11. Waiver of Notice. A director may waive notice of a meeting of the Board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and does not participate thereafter in the meeting.

Section 3.12. Absent Directors. A director may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a board meeting. If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as a vote in favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the director has consented or objected.

Section 3.13. Committees. A resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors may establish committees having the authority of the Board in the management of the business of the corporation to the extent provided in the resolution. Committee members shall be natural persons. Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different membership, a committee shall consist of one or more persons, who need not be directors, appointed by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present. A majority of the members of the committee present at a meeting is a quorum for the transaction of business, unless

7

* * *

  


a larger or small proportion or number is provided in the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or in a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present. Minutes, if any, of committee meetings shall be made available upon request to members of the committee and to any director.

Section 3.14. Action Without a Meeting. An action required or permitted to be taken at a board meeting or by a lawfully constituted committee thereof may be taken by written action signed by all of the directors or by all of the members of such committee, unless the action need not be approved by the shareholders and the Articles of Incorporation so provide, in which case, the action may be taken by written action signed by the number of directors that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the Board of Directors or the committee at which all directors or committee members were present. The written action is effective when signed by the required number of directors or committee members unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. When written action is permitted to be taken by less than all directors or committee members, all directors and committee members shall be notified immediately of its text and effective date.

Section 3.15. Fees and Expenses. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid such compensation for their services as a director as the Board of Directors may fix from time to time. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Committee members shall also be paid their expenses, if any, and be compensated as the Board of Directors may determine for attending committee meetings.
