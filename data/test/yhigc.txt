Exhibit 10.52 

2003 Supplemental Stock Option Plan 

Tod Nielsen 

BORLAND SOFTWARE CORPORATION 



RECITALS 

A. The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of promoting the interests of the Corporation, by providing eligible persons who are entering into employment with the Corporation with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation as an incentive for them to enter into such Service. 

B. Optionee is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or a Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation’s grant of an option to Optionee. 

C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix. 

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows: 

1\. Grant of Option. The Corporation hereby grants to Optionee, as of the Grant Date, a Non-Statutory Option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Grant Notice. Each vested and exercisable Option Share shall be purchasable from time to time during the option term specified in Paragraph 2 below at the Exercise Price. 

2\. Option Term. This option shall have a maximum term of ten (10) years measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 5 or 7. 

3\. Limited Transferability. 

(a) This option shall be neither transferable nor assignable by Optionee other than by will or the laws of inheritance following Optionee’s death and may be exercised, during Optionee’s lifetime, only by Optionee. However, Optionee may designate one or more persons as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of this option, and this option shall, in accordance with such designation, automatically be transferred to such beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the Optionee’s death while holding this option. Such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall take the transferred option subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including (without limitation) the limited time period during which this option may, pursuant to Paragraph 5, be exercised following Optionee’s death. 

(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph 3(a) above, this option may be assigned in whole or in part during Optionee’s lifetime to one or more members of Optionee’s family or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of one or more such family members or to Optionee’s former spouse, to the extent such assignment is in connection with the Optionee’s estate plan or pursuant to a domestic relations order. The assigned portion shall be exercisable

Tod Nielsen 

only by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to such assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for this option immediately prior to such assignment. 

4\. Dates of Vesting and Exercise. This option shall become vested and exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as specified in the Grant Notice. As the option becomes vested and exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate, and the option shall remain vested and exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the option term under Paragraph 5 or 7. 

5\. Cessation of Service. The option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this option shall cease to be outstanding and exercisable) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions become applicable: 

(a) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Permanent Disability or Misconduct) while this option is outstanding, then Optionee (or any person or persons to whom this option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3) shall have a period of fifteen (15) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option. In the event the Optionee is precluded by federal or state securities laws from selling the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to this option during such fifteen (15) month period, such period shall automatically be extended so that it ends thirty (30) days after such federal or state securities law prohibitions on the sale of the Shares lapses. Under no circumstances, however, shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 

(b) Should Optionee die while this option is outstanding, then the personal representative of Optionee’s estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to Optionee’s will or the laws of inheritance following Optionee’s death or to whom the option is transferred during Optionee’s lifetime pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3 shall have the right to exercise this option. However, if Optionee dies while holding this option and has an effective beneficiary designation in effect for this option at the time of his or her death, then the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries shall have the exclusive right to exercise this option following Optionee’s death. Any such right to exercise this option shall lapse, and this option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twenty-four (24) month period measured from the date of Optionee’s death or (ii) the Expiration Date. 

(c) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Permanent Disability while this option is outstanding, then Optionee (or any person or persons to whom this option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3) shall have a period of twenty-four (24) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option. In no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 

(d) Should Optionee’s Service be terminated for Misconduct or should Optionee otherwise engage in any Misconduct while this option is outstanding, then this option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding.

(e) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of Option Shares for which the option is vested and exercisable at the time of Optionee’s cessation of Service. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested or exercisable Option Shares for which the option has not been exercised. However, this option shall, immediately upon Optionee’s cessation of Service for any reason, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any Option Shares for which this option is not otherwise at that time vested or exercisable. 

6\. Authorized Leave of Absence. The following provisions shall apply upon the Optionee’s commencement of an authorized leave of absence: 

(a) The Optionee shall, for purposes of the exercise schedule set forth in the Grant Notice, receive Service credit for the first six (6) months of such authorized leave or for the entire period of the leave if such leave is less than six (6) months. 

(b) If the authorized leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, then no further Service credit shall be given after the first six (6) months of such leave, and the exercise schedule in effect under the Grant Notice shall be frozen at the end of that six (6) month period. Accordingly, this option shall not become exercisable for any additional installments of the Option Shares during the remainder of the Optionee’s authorized leave. 

(c) Upon the Optionee’s return to active Employee status following an authorized leave in excess of six (6) months, Service credit shall resume for each period of Service subsequently completed by Optionee, and such Service credit shall, for purposes of the exercise schedule in effect under the Grant Notice, be added to (i) the Service credited to the Optionee prior to the start of the authorized leave and (ii) any Service credit the Optionee received for such leave pursuant to paragraph 6(a) above. In no event, however, shall any Service credit be given for the period of such leave beyond the initial six (6) months of that leave or beyond the date of the Optionee’s actual cessation of Service. 

(d) In no event shall this option become exercisable for any additional Option Shares or otherwise remain outstanding if Optionee does not resume Employee status prior to the Expiration Date of the option term. 

7\. Change in Control. 

(a) This option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, shall be assumed or substituted for by the successor corporation (or the parent thereof) or may otherwise be continued in full force and effect pursuant to the express terms of the Change in Control transaction. Upon the consummation of such Change in Control, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent so assumed, substituted for or otherwise continued in effect. No portion of this option shall vest or become exercisable on an accelerated basis in connection with such Change in Control, except to the extent otherwise provided in any Special Acceleration Addendum attached to this Agreement.

(b) If this option is assumed or substituted for in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation’s outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption of this option, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control. 

(c) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

8\. Adjustment in Option Shares. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or class of securities subject to this option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. 

9\. Stockholder Rights. The holder of this option shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares. 

10\. Manner of Exercising Option. 

(a) In order to exercise this option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) must take the following actions: 

(i) Execute and deliver to the Corporation a Notice of Exercise for the Option Shares for which the option is exercised. 

(ii) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares in one or more of the following forms: 

(A) cash or check made payable to the Corporation; 

* * *

2003 Supplemental Stock Option Plan 

Tod Nielsen 

(B) shares of Common Stock held by Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Corporation’s earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date; or 

(C) through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable instructions (i) to a brokerage firm (reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation for purposes of administering such procedure) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (ii) to the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm on the settlement date in order to complete the sale. 

Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must accompany the Notice of Exercise delivered to the Corporation in connection with the option exercise. 

(iii) Furnish to the Corporation appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this option. 

(iv) Make appropriate arrangements with the Corporation (or Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all applicable income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the option exercise. 

(b) As soon as practical after the Exercise Date, the Corporation shall directs its transfer agent to issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the appropriate legends affixed thereto. 

(c) In no event may this option be exercised for any fractional shares. 

11\. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. 

(a) The exercise of this option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Optionee with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance.

(b) The inability of the Corporation to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Corporation to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall relieve the Corporation of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Corporation, however, shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all such approvals. 

12\. Successors and Assigns. Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3 and 7, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns and Optionee, Optionee’s assigns, the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Optionee’s estate and any beneficiaries of this option designated by Optionee. 

13\. Notices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in either written or electronic format and delivered to the Stock Administrator of the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Optionee shall be in writing and addressed to Optionee at the address indicated below Optionee’s signature line on the Grant Notice. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal or electronic delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

14\. Mandatory Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to or otherwise connected with this Agreement or the option evidenced hereby or the validity, construction, performance or termination of this Agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration to be held in the county in which the Optionee is (or has most recently been) employed by the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary) at the time of such arbitration. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by (i) the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American Arbitration Association and (ii) U.S. federal arbitration law, without reference to any state arbitration law. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of California to the merits of any dispute or claim, without resort to that state’s conflicts-of-laws rules. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration and shall be in lieu of the rights those parties may otherwise have to a jury trial; provided, however, that such decision shall be subject to correction, confirmation or vacation in accordance with the provisions and standards of applicable law governing the judicial review of arbitration awards. Judgment shall be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter of such dispute or controversy. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that the parties would be entitled to seek in court of law. The Corporation shall pay all arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required if the dispute were decided in a court of law or equity. 

15\. Construction. This Agreement and the option evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the

Tod Nielsen 

Plan. All decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in this option. 

16\. Governing Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict-of-laws rules thereof or of any other jurisdiction. 

17\. Excess Shares. If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of shares of Common Stock which may without stockholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
