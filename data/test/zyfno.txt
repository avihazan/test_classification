1\. Term. The Company hereby employs Employee and Employee hereby accepts such employment upon the terms and conditions hereof for an initial term commencing on November 1, 2004 (the “Effective Date”) and ending, subject to renewal or termination as provided herein, on October 31, 2009 (the “Initial Term”); provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically continue for successive one month periods thereafter (each such period being an “Additional Term”) unless either party has delivered written notice of termination to the other party no later than six months prior to the end of the Initial Term or 60 days prior to the end of any Additional Term. Sections 7 through 20 and 22 through 26 shall survive any termination of Employee’s employment under this Agreement. The Employee hereby covenants that as of the Effective Date any agreement between Employee and the Company, or any of its affiliates, entered into prior to the date hereof, relating to Employee’s employment with such entity, shall terminate as of, or have been terminated prior to, the Effective Date. 

2\. Duties. Employee shall serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or subject to Section 5, in such other senior management position as the Company shall determine. Subject to the foregoing, Employee shall perform such duties as may be assigned by the Company to Employee from time to time, and shall travel for business purposes to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate in the performance of such duties. 

Employee shall perform such duties on a full time basis (subject to the Company’s written policies on vacations, illness, government service, etc. applicable to employees at Employee’s level in effect from time to time), provided, however, that Employee shall not be precluded from devoting such time to personal affairs as shall not interfere with the performance of his or her duties hereunder. In performing his or her duties hereunder, Employee shall comply with the Company’s policies and procedures in effect from time to time. Unless Employee otherwise consents, the headquarters for the performance of Employee’s services shall be the principal executive offices of the Company and /or the Denver, Colorado area, subject to such reasonable travel as may be appropriate or required in the performance of Employee’s duties in the business of the Company. 

3\. Compensation. The Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Employee, during the term of employment, an annual salary in respect of each calendar year at the rate of not less than $515,000 per annum. The Company may increase, but not decrease, such annual salary at any time and from time to time during the term of employment. In addition to annual salary, Employee may be entitled to receive an annual bonus in respect of each calendar year based on a target percentage of the salary paid to Employee during such calendar year of 100%. Employee acknowledges that his or her actual annual bonus may vary and range from 0% to 150% of the target amount, depending on actual performance of the Company and Employee.

The Board of Directors shall determine, in its sole discretion, the amount of any salary increase annually, the amount of any annual bonus and whether to increase the target percentage of Employee’s annual bonus. The payment of any bonus compensation shall be made in accordance with the Company’s then current practices and policies, including without limitation, less the usual required payroll deductions and withholding. 

The Company shall pay or reimburse Employee, in accordance with Company policies applicable to employees at Employee’s level, for all travel, entertainment and other business expenses actually incurred or paid by Employee in the performance of his or her duties hereunder, if properly substantiated and submitted. 

4\. Benefits. 

(a) Employee shall be eligible to participate in any pension, profit-sharing, employee stock ownership, vacation, insurance, hospitalization, medical, health, disability and other employee benefit or welfare plan, program or policy whether now existing or established hereafter (collectively, the “Benefit Plans”), to the extent that employees at Employee’s level are generally deemed eligible under the general provisions thereof. The Company reserves the right to amend or cancel any such Benefit Plan in its sole discretion. 

(b) Life Insurance. During the Initial Term of the term of employment, with respect to each indicated year, the Company shall pay the Employee an annual amount equal to 167% of the premium the Company would have to pay to obtain, from a carrier chosen by the Company, term life insurance coverage on the Employee’s life in the following amounts for the indicated period during the term of employment:

5\. Termination.

(a) For Cause. Provided that notice of termination has not previously been given under any other Subsection hereof, the Company shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment for cause upon written notice to Employee at any time. In such event, Employee’s employment with the Company shall terminate immediately and Employee shall be entitled to receive (i) any earned and unpaid salary accrued through the date of such termination, and (ii) subject to the terms thereof, any benefits which may be due to Employee under the provisions of any Benefit Plan. Employee hereby disclaims any right to receive a pro rata portion of his or her annual bonus with respect to the year in which such termination occurs. For purposes hereof, “cause” shall mean termination by action of the Company’s Board of Directors or any committee thereof because of (i) Employee’s conviction (treating a nolo contendere plea as a conviction) of a felony (whether or not any right to appeal has been exercised); (ii) willful refusal without proper cause to perform his or her obligations under this Agreement; (iii) misappropriation, embezzlement or reckless or willful destruction of Company property; (iv) willful and material breach of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company having a significant adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or reputation; or (v) Employee’s material breach of the covenants provided for in Sections 8, 9 and 10, of this Agreement. In the event (i) such termination is because of the Employee’s willful refusal without proper cause to perform any one or more of his or her obligations under this Agreement, (ii) such notice is the first such notice of termination for any reason delivered by the Company to the Employee under this Section 5(a), and (iii) within 10 days following the date of such notice the Employee shall cease his or her refusal and shall use his or her best efforts to perform such obligations, the termination shall not be effective. 

(b) Termination by Employee For Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause.

(i) Termination by Employee. Provided that notice of termination has not previously been given under any other Section hereof, Employee shall have the right to terminate his or her employment with the Company under this Agreement for good reason upon 30 days prior written notice delivered to the Company at any time within 180 days after the occurrence of any of the following events (a “Good Reason Event”), indicating in such notice which Event has occurred: 

(A) A change in the location of Employee’s office or of the Company’s principal executive offices to a place which is more than 50 miles from the location of Employee’s office or the location of the Company’s principal executive offices prior to such change; 

(B) A material reduction in Employee’s decision-making, budgetary, operating, staff and other responsibilities, taken as a whole, or a change in the person or persons to whom Employee reports to a person or persons of lesser rank, title or responsibility; provided, however, that the appointment of a non-executive Chairman of the Board or any other officer whose appointment is required or determined by the Board of Directors to be advisable in light of legal or regulatory requirements shall not be deemed a Good Reason Event; or 

3 

* * *

(C) Any material breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

(ii) Termination by the Company. Provided that notice of termination has not previously been given under any other Subsection hereof, the Company shall have the right at any time with the approval of a majority vote of the Board of Directors to terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement without cause, by giving written notice thereof to Employee. 

(c) Upon the expiration of the notice period provided in Section 5(b)(i) or in the notice given under Section 5(b)(ii), Employee shall be relieved of his or her management position with the Company and his or her duties hereunder; provided, however, that a Good Reason Event shall not be deemed to have occurred if within such 30-day notice period the Company shall have cured the conditions that constituted the Good Reason Event. If either such notice is so given, Employee shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms thereof, all benefits which may be due to Employee under the provisions of any Benefit Plan and Section 5(d) hereof and to elect in the notice under Section 5(b)(i) or, within 30 days after receiving a notice under Section 5(b)(ii), to receive either a lump sum severance payment in the amount, and upon the terms and conditions, provided in Section 5(c)(A) and calculated as set forth in the last paragraph of this Section 5(c), or to remain an employee of the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Section 5(c)(B). Employee shall elect either: 

(A) to terminate his or her employment with the Company, in which case Employee shall receive: (x) subject to the terms thereof, all benefits which may be due to Employee under the provisions of any Benefit Plan; and (y) in a lump sum severance payment, within 30 days following the effective date of such termination, the present value (using the discount rate described below) of an amount equal to the sum of the annual salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination of employment or, if applicable, immediately prior to the Good Reason Event, whichever is greater, plus an annual bonus in a minimum amount equal to Employee’s then applicable target bonus amount or, if applicable, the Employee’s applicable target bonus amount in effect immediately prior to the Good Reason Event, whichever is greater, for the remainder of the existing term of this Agreement, without any further renewal or continuation, provided that such amount shall be not less than the sum of such salary and bonus pro rated for a 24-month period, or   
  
(B) to remain an employee of the Company for a period (as determined by Employee) of up to 24 months following the date notice of termination is given pursuant to Section 5, in which case Employee shall be relieved of his or her management position with the Company and his or her duties hereunder, and shall (i) continue to receive both salary, based on a rate equal to his or her annual rate in effect on the date of termination of employment or, if applicable, immediately prior to the Good Reason Event, whichever is   
  
4 

* * *

greater, and annual bonus in respect of such period (in each case payable within 30 days after the end of the respective calendar year and prorated for any portion of a year), each such bonus to be based on an amount equal to Employee’s then applicable target bonus amount or, if applicable, the Employee’s applicable target bonus amount in effect immediately prior to the Good Reason Event, whichever is greater, and (ii) receive a discounted lump sum payment pursuant to Section 5(c)(A)(y) for any portion of the term of employment remaining after such period (without any further renewal or continuation); provided, however, that if Employee accepts full-time employment with any other corporation, partnership, trust, government or other entity (“Entity”) during such period or notifies the Company in writing of his or her intention to terminate his or her employment during such period, Employee shall cease to be an employee of the Company effective upon the commencement of such employment or the effective date of such termination as specified by Employee in such notice, and shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms thereof, all benefits due to Employee under the provisions of any Benefit Plan and a discounted lump sum cash payment for the balance of the salary and bonus Employee would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5(c)(B) had Employee remained on the Company’s payroll until the end of the Initial Term or such 24-month period whichever is greater, provided, further, however, that Employee shall not be entitled to receive any such lump sum cash payment if he or she accepts full-time employment with any subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Affiliate” shall mean an Entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Company or Time Warner Inc. (“TWI”). 

(C) In partial consideration for the Company’s obligation to make the payments described in this Section 5(c), Employee shall execute and deliver to the Company a release in the form as set forth in Exhibit A. The Company shall deliver such release to Employee promptly after the written notice of termination or a Good Reason Event, as applicable, is delivered pursuant to this Section 5. Employee shall execute and deliver such release to the General Counsel of the Company within 21 days of receipt of notice of termination. If Employee shall fail to execute and deliver to the Company such release within 30 days of Employee’s receipt thereof from the Company, Employee’s employment with the Company shall terminate effective at the end of such 30-day period and Employee shall receive, in lieu of the severance arrangements described in Section 5(b), a lump sum cash payment in an amount determined in accordance with the personnel policies of the Company then applicable.   
  
Any lump sum payments required to be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(c) shall be discounted to present value from the times at which such amounts would have been paid absent any such termination at an annual discount rate for the relevant period equal to the “applicable Federal rate” (within the meaning of Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”)), compounded semi-annually, in effect on the date of such termination. The use of this rate is hereby elected by the Company and Employee pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.280G- I 

5 

* * *

Q/A32, if applicable (provided that in the event such election is not permitted, such other rate determined as of such other date as is applicable for determining present value under Section 280G of the Code shall be used). 

(d) In addition, whether Employee elects to receive either a lump sum severance payment in the amount, and upon the terms and conditions, provided in Section 5(c)(A) and calculated as set forth in the last paragraph of Section 5(c), or to remain an employee of the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Section 5(c)(B), during the period (the “COBRA Period”) from the date the notice of termination of Employee’s employment is effective (i.e., Employee is no longer considered an employee for payroll purposes) until the earlier of (x) the date the Employee is no longer obtaining health insurance coverage pursuant to provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (“COBRA”), or (y) the last day of the Initial Term, the Company shall pay Employee $15,800 per year. During the period, if any, from, but excluding, the last day of the COBRA Period until the earlier of (a) the last day of the Initial Term or (b) the date Employee is eligible to receive health benefits by virtue of other employment, the Company shall pay Employee $5,000 per year. These amounts will be appropriately prorated for any partial period and may, at the Company’s option be paid at monthly or quarterly intervals in advance or such other intervals as the Company deems convenient. 

(e) Office Facilities. For the period beginning when Employee gives notice of termination under Section 5(b)(i) or receives notice of termination from the Company pursuant to this Section 5(b)(ii), and ending six months thereafter, Employee will, without charge to Employee, have use of reasonable office space and reasonable office facilities at Employee’s principal job location immediately prior to his or her termination of employment, or other location reasonably close to such location, together with reasonable secretarial services in each case appropriate to an employee of Employee’s position and responsibilities prior to such termination of employment but taking into account Employee’s reduced need for such office space and secretarial services. 

(f) During the period Employee remains an employee of the Company pursuant to Section 5(c)(B), Employee will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company’s Benefit Plans and to receive, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, all benefits, which are received by other employees at Employee’s level thereunder other than options or similar equity-based or incentive awards. 

6\. Death; Disability.

(a) Death. If Employee shall die while employed by the Company, Employee’s employment under this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and Employee’s estate or beneficiaries, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable but in any event within 30 days after reasonably satisfactory evidence of Employee’s death is received by the Company (i) any earned and unpaid salary accrued to Employee through the period ending 30 days following the date of Employee’s death and a pro rata portion of the target annual bonus amount in effect immediately prior to Employee’s death; and (ii) subject to the terms thereof, any benefits which may be due to Employee’s estate or beneficiaries under the provisions of any Benefit Plan. 

6 

* * *

(b) Disability. Provided that notice of termination has not previously been given under any Section hereof, if Employee becomes ill or is injured or disabled during the term of this Agreement such that Employee fails to perform all or substantially all the duties to be rendered hereunder and such failure continues for a period in excess of 26 consecutive weeks (a “Disability”), the Company may terminate the employment of Employee under this Agreement upon written notice to Employee at any time and thereupon Employee shall be entitled to receive (i) any earned and unpaid salary accrued through the date of such termination; (ii) subject to the terms thereof, any benefits which may be due to Employee under the provisions of any Benefit Plan; and (iii) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the sum of 75% of Employee’s then current annual salary and then applicable target annual bonus amount prorated for an 18 month period, less the amount of any disability insurance proceeds payable to Employee under any disability insurance policy or program covering Employee provided by the Company, including the group disability insurance coverage provided to certain senior executives. 

In addition to the Company’s standard group coverage, during the Employee’s term of employment, the Company shall provide disability insurance coverage for the Employee under the Company’s Individual Supplemental Income Protection Plan available generally to the senior executives of the Company, at a level comparable to that available to Employee under such Plan on November 1, 2004, or substantially equivalent coverage. In addition, during the Employee’s term of employment, the Company shall obtain additional disability insurance coverage for the Employee that provides a monthly disability benefit of $6,500 or such lesser amount that Employee shall select. 

7\. Stock Options and Other Incentive Awards. Upon Employee’s termination of employment with the Company for any reason, Employee’s rights to benefits and payments under any stock options, restricted shares or other incentive plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of such plans and any agreements under which such stock options, restricted shares or other awards were granted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee may disclose such trade secrets or confidential information, knowledge, data or terms when required to do so by a court or government agency or legislative body of competent jurisdiction, provided Employee first notifies the Company orally and in writing as promptly as possible of such requirement so that the Company may either seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, and provided further that if, in the absence of such protective order or waiver, Employee is 

7
