4.1 Benefits Upon Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement under Section 3.3 (Early Termination by Executive), Section 3.4 (Termination for Cause) or Section 3.5 (Termination Due to Death or Disability), all salary and benefits of Executive hereunder shall cease immediately. Upon termination of this Agreement by Employer for any reason other than those set forth in Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, Executive shall be entitled to the continuation of Executive’s base salary for one (1) year, payable in equal installments in conformity with Employer’s normal payroll period.

During the period of this severance pay, Executive shall cooperate with Employer in providing for the orderly transition of Executive’s duties and responsibilities to other individuals, as reasonably requested by Employer.

4.2 Rights Against Employer. The benefits payable under this Article IV are exclusive, and no amount shall become payable to any person (including the Executive) by reason of termination of employment for any reason, with or without Cause, except as provided in this Article IV.

During his employment by Employer and thereafter, Executive shall not directly or indirectly disclose such information to any person or use any such information, except as required in the course of his employment during the Employment Term. All records, files, keys, documents, and the like relating to Employer’s business, which Executive shall prepare, copy or use, or come into contact with, shall be and remain Employer’s sole property, shall not be removed from Employer’s premises without its written consent, and shall be returned to Employer upon the termination of this Agreement.
