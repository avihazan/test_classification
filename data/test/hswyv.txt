NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the following mutual covenants and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

Defined Terms

1.1 Change in Control. A “Change in Control” shall mean the earliest of (a) the purchase or other acquisition of outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock by any entity, person or group of beneficial ownership, as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries or employee benefit plans), in one or more transactions, such that the holder, as a result of such acquisition, now owns more than 50% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote for the election of directors (“Voting Stock”); (b) the completion by any entity, person, or group (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries or employee benefit plans) of a tender offer or an exchange offer for more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company; or (c) the effective time of (1) a merger or consolidation of the Company with one or more corporations as a result of which the holders of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such merger or consolidation hold less than 50% of the Voting Stock of the surviving or resulting corporation immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (2) a transfer of all or substantially all of the property or assets of the Company other than to an entity of which the Company owns at least 80% of the Voting Stock, or (3) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred hereunder unless such Change in Control also constitutes a “change in control event” (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder).

1.1 Determination Date

1.2 Payment Date. The Payment Date shall mean the date the Committee determines that the Performance Shares payable upon achievement of the Performance Goals set forth in Exhibit A shall be paid, which date shall be within thirty (30) business days following the Determination Date or, if the Company deems it necessary to comply with any applicable securities

ARTICLE II

Performance Shares

2.1 Award of Performance Shares. The Company hereby grants to the Recipient a target award of ________ Performance Shares, subject to the restrictions contained herein and the provisions of the Plan.

2.2 Performance-Based Right to Payment.

(a) The number of shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) that shall be issued shall be determined based on the Company’s achievement of the Performance Goals as set forth on Exhibit A. On the Determination Date, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine and certify whether and to what extent the Performance Goals as set forth on Exhibit A have been attained. The payment of Shares is contingent on the attainment of the Performance Goals as set forth on Exhibit A. Accordingly, the Recipient will not become entitled to payment with respect to the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement unless and until the Committee determines that the Performance Goals set forth on Exhibit A have been attained. Upon such determination by the Committee and subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the Recipient shall be entitled to payment of that portion of the Performance Shares as corresponds to the Performance Goals attained (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) as set forth on Exhibit A. Furthermore, except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.3, in order to be entitled to payment with respect to any Performance Shares, the Recipient must be employed by the Company through the end of the Performance Period.

(b) On the Payment Date, the Company shall deliver to the Recipient a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) equal to the number of Performance Shares subject to this award that are payable pursuant to the achievement of the Performance Goals set forth on Exhibit A.

2.3 Forfeiture of Performance Shares Upon Termination of Employment. 

(a) Upon the Recipient’s termination of employment prior to the end of the Performance Period, all rights with respect to any unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and the Recipient will not be entitled to any payments or benefits with respect thereto; provided, however, that in the event of the Recipient’s termination of employment by reason of his or her Retirement, death or Disability prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Recipient or the Recipient’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive, on the Payment Date, Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement that would have been paid had the Recipient remained employed until the end of the Performance Period.

(b) Upon a termination of the Recipient’s employment for cause (as such term is defined under Section VII.F.2 of the Plan), whether before or after the end of a Performance Period, the Recipient shall forfeit all rights with respect to any unpaid Performance Shares awarded hereunder. 

  


2.4 Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Period shall end as of the date of the Change in Control. The attainment of the Performance Goals shall be measured against actual performance through the date of the Change in Control, with appropriate adjustments being made to the Performance Goals as determined to be reasonable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect the shortened Performance Period.

2.5 Prohibition Against Transfer. The Performance Shares may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Recipient, or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any transfer in violation of this Section 2.5 shall be void and of no further effect.

ARTICLE III

Miscellaneous

3.1 Provisions of the Plan Control. This Agreement shall be governed by the provisions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein by reference.

3.2 No Rights as Shareholder. The Recipient shall not have any right to exercise the rights or privileges of a shareholder with respect to any Performance Shares until such Shares are distributed.

3.3 Taxes. The Company may require payment of or withhold any income or employment tax which it believes is payable as a result of the grant or vesting of the Performance Shares or the payment of Shares in connection therewith, and the Company may defer making delivery with respect to the Shares until arrangements satisfactory to the Company have been made with regard to any such withholding obligation. In accordance with the Plan, the Company may withhold Shares to satisfy such withholding obligations.

3.4 No Employment Rights. The award of the Performance Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall not give the Recipient any right to remain employed by the Company or any affiliate thereof.

3.5 Forfeitures. If the Recipient breaches any of the agreements and obligations set forth on Exhibit B hereto (the “Protective Agreements”), any grant, payment or delivery made pursuant to this Agreement during the three (3) year period prior to the breach of the Protective Agreements shall be forfeited. The Company shall notify the Recipient in writing of any such forfeiture within one (1) year of the date it acquires actual knowledge of such breach. Within ten (10) days after receiving such a notice from the Company, the Recipient shall return to the Company any Shares that the Recipient received in connection with the forfeited grant or pay to the Company in cash the value of such Shares, as such value is determined on the date of the notice. The Recipient’s failure to return to the Company any certificate(s) evidencing the Shares required to be returned pursuant to this paragraph shall not preclude the Company from canceling any and all such certificate(s) and Shares. Similarly, the Recipient’s failure to pay to the Company any cash required to be paid pursuant to this paragraph shall not preclude the Company from taking any and all legal action it deems appropriate to facilitate its recovery. The parties further acknowledge and agree

3.8 Compliance with Section 409A. It is intended that any amount payable under this Agreement will comply with Section 409A of the Code, and regulations and guidance related thereto, so as not to subject the Recipient to the payment of any interest or tax penalty which may be imposed under Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that the Company shall not be responsible for any such interest and tax penalties. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan needs to be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then such provision shall be so interpreted, to the extent and in the manner necessary to be interpreted in compliance with such requirements of the Code, either generally or as applied to such circumstance.
