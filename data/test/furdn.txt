THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the 28th day of December, 2011, by and between Rentech Nitrogen, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Borrower”), Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Guarantor”, and, together with Borrower, the “Loan Parties”, and each, a “Loan Party”), and Rentech, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Lender”). 

RECITAL 

Borrower has requested from Lender the credit accommodations described below (collectively the “Credits”), and Lender has agreed to provide the Credits to Borrower on the terms and conditions contained herein. 

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, Lender and Borrower hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I 

THE CREDITS AND THE GUARANTY 

Section 1.1 Term Loan. 

(a) Term Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender hereby agrees to make advances to Borrower in the aggregate principal amount of up to Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) (the “Term Loan”), which amount shall be exclusive of any capitalized interest added to the principal balance of the Term Loan pursuant to Section 1.1(c). The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used to (i) finance certain capital expenditures of Borrower associated with the Expansion and (ii) pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Term Loan. Borrower’s obligation to repay the Term Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (as it may be amended, the “Note”), all terms of which are incorporated herein by this reference. Lender’s commitment to provide the Term Loan shall terminate on May 31, 2012 or such earlier date designated by Borrower in a written notification to Lender. Upon the request of Lender, each request for an advance under the Term Loan shall be accompanied by a breakdown of the use of all funds requested from Borrower. 

(b) Repayment. The principal amount of the Term Loan and the accrued interest as set forth in Section 1.2 below shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date. 

(c) Capitalized Interest. Interest on the Term Loan shall accrue monthly on the last day of each month so long as any principal under the Term Loan is unpaid. Prior to the date on which the Revolving Credit Agreement is terminated and all obligations thereunder have been finally paid in full or if such interest is not paid on the last day of any month thereafter, interest on the Term Loan shall be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan. 

(d) Optional and Mandatory Prepayment. The Loan Parties may prepay principal and accrued interest on the Term Loan at any time, in any amount and without penalty. All prepayments of principal and interest shall be applied first to accrued interest, and second to principal. Subject to compliance with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Loan Parties shall, within two (2) Business Days of receipt thereof, apply all cash proceeds of an Equity Offering or Indebtedness Offering, net of taxes and customary fees, commissions, costs and other expenses incurred in connection therewith, to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan plus any accrued interest. 

* * *

Section 1.2 Interest/Fees. 

(a) Interest. Subject to Section 1.2(b), the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate in effect from time to time plus the applicable Margin. The term “LIBOR Rate” shall mean the offered rate per annum for deposits of Dollars for a one month period that appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 A.M. (London, England time) two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of the upcoming calendar month. If no such offered rate exists, such rate will be the rate of interest per annum, as determined by Lender at which deposits of Dollars in immediately available funds are offered at 11:00 A.M. (London, England time) two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of the upcoming calendar month by major financial institutions reasonably satisfactory to Agent in the London interbank market for the applicable principal amount on such date of determination. 

(b) Default Interest. At all times when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the LIBOR Rate plus applicable Margin in effect from time to time (the “Default Rate”). In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments, fees or other amounts owed hereunder and not paid when due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest at the Default Rate. Payment or acceptance of the Default Rate is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Lender. 

(c) Computation and Payment. Interest on the principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed. Interest on the Term Loan shall be calculated monthly in arrears on the last day of each month so long as any principal under the Term Loan is unpaid. 

(d) Closing Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender a non-refundable closing fee equal to 2.0% of the aggregate committed principal amount of the Term Loans (the “Closing Fee”), which closing fee shall be due and payable in full on the date this Agreement is executed; provided, that if prior to the commencement of the Term Loan Period (x) the Term Loans are fully repaid and (y) the obligation of Lender to provide advances hereunder is terminated (clauses (x) and (y) together, the “Facility Termination”), then the Closing Fee Credit shall be applied against amounts outstanding under this Agreement in connection with the Facility Termination. For purposes of this Section 1.2(d), the Closing Fee Credit equals (x) 75% of the Closing Fee if the Facility Termination occurs on or prior to March 31, 2012 or (y) 50% of the Closing Fee if the Facility Termination occurs after March 31, 2012 but prior to the commencement of the Term Loan Period. For avoidance of doubt, Borrower shall not be entitled to the Closing Fee Credit if the Facility Termination does not occur prior to the commencement of the Term Loan Period. 

Section 1.3 Guaranty. 

(a) To induce Lender to make the Term Loan, Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, of all the obligations of Borrower whether existing on the date hereof or hereinafter incurred or created (the “Guaranteed Obligations”).

* * *

(b) Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defense, and hereby agrees that its obligations under this section are irrevocable, absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged as a result of or otherwise affected, other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

(c) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any claim, defense, setoff or counterclaim based on diligence, promptness, presentment, requirements for any demand or notice hereunder including any of the following: (a) any demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest; (b) any notice of acceptance; (c) any presentment, demand, protest or further notice or other requirements of any kind with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation (including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon) becoming immediately due and payable; and (d) any other notice in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation or any part thereof, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower. Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, Guarantor further unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation or any right of reimbursement or contribution or similar right against Borrower or any Guarantor by reason of any Loan Document or any payment made thereunder. No obligation of any Guarantor hereunder shall be discharged other than by complete performance. 

(d) Guarantor, and by its acceptance this guaranty, Lender, hereby confirm that it is their intention that this Guaranty and the Guaranteed Obligations not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under any applicable laws. To effectuate the foregoing intention, Lender and Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Guaranteed Obligations not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under any applicable laws.
