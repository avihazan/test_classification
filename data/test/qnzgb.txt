THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of December 26, 2007 by and between TEXAS ROADHOUSE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and SCOTT M. COLOSI, a resident of the Commonwealth of Kentucky ("Executive"). 

RECITALS 

A. The Executive is currently the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 

B. The Company desires to continue the employment of Executive, and Executive wishes such employment, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, to be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective agreements of the Company and Executive set forth below, the Company and Executive, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

1. Effective Date. The terms and conditions of Executive's employment hereunder shall become effective upon December 26, 2007 (the "Effective Date"). 

2. Employment. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Executive's period of employment under this Agreement shall be the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on January 7, 2011 (the "Third Anniversary Date"), which term, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, shall be extended on the Third Anniversary Date and on each anniversary of that date thereafter, for a period of one year thereafter (which term together with any such extensions, if any, shall be hereinafter defined as the "Term"), unless the Executive's employment terminates earlier in accordance with Section 9 hereof. Thereafter, if Executive continues in the employ of the Company, the employment relationship shall continue to be at will, terminable by either Executive or the Company at any time and for any reason, with or without cause, and subject to such terms and conditions established by the Company from time to time. 

3. Position and Duties.

(a) Employment with the Company. While Executive is employed by the Company during the Term, Executive shall be employed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and such other titles as the Company may designate, and shall perform such duties and responsibilities as the Company shall assign to him from time to time, including duties and responsibilities relating to the Company's wholly-owned and partially owned subsidiaries and other affiliates. 

(b) Performance of Duties and Responsibilities. Executive shall serve the Company faithfully and to the best of his ability and shall devote his full working time, attention and efforts to the business of the Company during his employment with the Company hereunder. While Executive is employed by the Company during the Term, Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or to such other person as designated by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). Executive hereby represents and confirms that he is under no contractual or legal commitments that would prevent him from fulfilling his duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement. During his employment with the Company, Executive shall not accept other employment or engage in other material business activity, except as approved in writing by the Board. Executive may participate in charitable activities and personal investment activities to a reasonable extent, and he may serve as a director of business organizations as approved by the Board, so long as such activities and directorships do not interfere with the performance of his duties and responsibilities hereunder.

4. Compensation.

(a) Base Salary. While Executive is employed by the Company during the Term, the Company shall pay to Executive a base salary at the rate of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) per fiscal year, less deductions and withholdings, which base salary shall be paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies and procedures. If the Executive's employment is extended beyond the Third Anniversary Date as provided in Section 2, then on or after the Third Anniversary Date, and annually thereafter, the Executive's base salary may be reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine whether it should be increased. 

(b) Incentive Bonus. Commencing with the first full fiscal quarter of the Company's 2008 fiscal year and for each full fiscal quarter thereafter that Executive is employed by the Company during the Term, Executive shall be eligible for an annual incentive bonus, to be paid on a quarterly basis, based upon achievement of defined goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Board and in accordance with the terms of any incentive plan of the Company in effect from time to time (the "Incentive Bonus"). 

(i) The level of achievement of the objectives each fiscal quarter and the amount payable as Incentive Bonus shall be determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee. Any Incentive Bonus earned for a fiscal quarter shall be paid to Executive on or before the 90th day following the last day of such fiscal quarter. 

(ii) Subject to the achievement of the goals established by the Compensation Committee, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in fiscal year 2008, Executive shall be eligible for an annual target incentive bonus of $250,000. In fiscal year 2009, Executive shall be eligible for an annual target incentive bonus of $262,500. In fiscal year 2010, Executive shall be eligible for annual target incentive bonus of $275,625. Executive's eligibility for the increased target incentive bonus amounts in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 shall be conditioned upon an appropriate increase in the goals to be achieved each year, as determined by the Compensation Committee. If the Executive's employment is extended beyond the Third Anniversary Date as provided in Section 2, then on or after the Third Anniversary Date, and annually thereafter, the Executive's annual target incentive bonus may be reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine whether it should be increased. 

(c) Restricted Stock Awards.

(i) Pursuant to Section 7 of the Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Incentive Plan") in place on the Effective Date, on January 7, 2008 the Executive shall be granted a stock bonus award whereby the Executive has the conditional right to receive upon vesting 125,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock ("Restricted Stock Units"), provided this Agreement has been fully executed by both the Executive and the Company. If it has not been fully executed by January 7, 2008, the Restricted Stock Units will be granted to the Executive on the date it is fully executed. 

(ii) The Restricted Stock Units shall vest in four equal installments as follows provided the Executive continues to provide services to the Company, as provided in the Equity Incentive Plan, on such dates:

(C) A tender or exchange offer, other than one made by: 

(I) the Company, or by

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Agreement by virtue of any transaction which results in Executive, or a group of persons which includes Executive, acquiring, directly or indirectly, securities representing 20 percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities of the Company. 

(v) A termination by Executive for "Good Reason" shall mean a termination based on: 

(A) the assignment to Executive of a different title or job responsibilities that result in a substantial decrease in the level of responsibility from those in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control; 

(B) a reduction by the Company or the surviving company in Executive's base pay as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control;

(e) Expenses. While Executive is employed by the Company during the Term, the Company shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket business, travel and entertainment expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties and responsibilities hereunder, subject to the Company's normal policies and procedures for expense verification and documentation. 

(f) Vacations and Holidays. Executive shall be entitled to be absent from his duties for the Company by reason of vacation for a period of three weeks per calendar year, or such longer period as the Company allows based on employment tenure with the Company. Executive shall coordinate his vacation schedule with the Company so as not to impose an undue burden on the Company. In addition, Executive shall be entitled to such national and religious holidays as the Company shall approve for all of its employees from time to time. 

5. Affiliated Entities. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall include the Company and each corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or other entity that is controlled by the Company, or is under common control with the Company (in each case "control" meaning the direct or indirect ownership of 50% or more of all outstanding equity interests), provided, however, that the Executive's title need not be identical for each of the affiliated entities nor the same as that for the Company. 

6. Confidential Information. Except as required in the performance of Executive's duties as an employee of the Company or as authorized in writing by the Board, Executive shall not, either during Executive's employment with the Company or at any time thereafter, use, disclose or make accessible to any person any confidential information for any purpose. "Confidential Information" means information proprietary to the Company or its suppliers or prospective suppliers and not generally known (including trade secret information) about the Company's suppliers, products, services, personnel, customers, recipes, pricing, sales strategies, technology, computer software code, methods, processes, designs, research, development systems, techniques, finances, accounting, purchasing, and plans. All information disclosed to Executive or to which Executive obtains access, whether originated by Executive or by others, during the period of Executive's employment by the Company (whether before, during, or after the Term), shall be presumed to be Confidential Information if it is treated by the Company as being Confidential Information or if Executive has a reasonable basis to believe it to be Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that the above-described knowledge and information constitutes a unique and valuable asset of the Company and represents a substantial investment of time and expense by the Company, and that any disclosure or other use of such knowledge or information other than for the sole benefit of the Company would be wrongful and would cause irreparable harm to the Company. During Executive's employment with the Company, Executive shall refrain from committing any acts that would materially reduce the value of such knowledge or information to the Company. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any knowledge or information that (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally publicly known, or (ii) is required to be disclosed by law or legal process, other than as a direct or indirect result of the breach of this Agreement by Executive. Executive acknowledges that the obligations imposed by this Section 6 are in addition to, and not in place of, any obligations imposed by applicable statutory or common law. 

7. Noncompetition Covenant.

(a) Agreement Not to Compete. During Executive's employment with the Company (whether before, during, or after the Term) and during the Restricted Period (as defined below), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of any person or entity other than the Company, including without limitation as a proprietor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, member of any association, consultant or otherwise, engage in any business that is directly competitive with the business of the Company, including without limitation any business that operates one or more full-service, casual dining steakhouse restaurants, within the 50 United States or any foreign country in which the Company is operating or in which the Executive knows the Company contemplates commencing operations during the Restricted Period. The provisions of this Section 7(a) shall also apply to any business which is directly competitive with any other business which the Company acquires or develops during Executive's employment with the Company.

(b) Agreement Not to Hire. Except as required in the performance of Executive's duties as an employee of the Company, during Executive's employment with the Company (whether before, during, or after the Term) and during the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, hire, engage or solicit or induce or attempt to induce to cease working for the Company, any person who is then an employee of the Company or who was an employee of the Company during the six (6) month period immediately preceding Executive's termination of employment with the Company. 

(c) Agreement Not to Solicit. Except as required in the performance of Executive's duties as an employee of the Company, during Executive's employment with the Company (whether before, during, or after the Term) and during the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, request, advise, induce or attempt to induce any vendor, supplier or other business contact of the Company to cancel, curtail, cease doing business with, or otherwise adversely change its relationship with the Company. 

(d) Restricted Period. "Restricted Period" hereunder means the period commencing on the last day of Executive's employment with the Company and ending on the date that is two years following the last day of the Term. 

(i) In the event the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause following a Change in Control as defined in this Agreement, and before the end of the Term of this Agreement, the Restricted Period will begin on the last day of the Executive's employment with the Company and end on the date the last payment of the current base salary is made to the Executive pursuant to paragraph 10(c). 

(e) Acknowledgment. Executive hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 7 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and that any violation of this Section 7 by Executive shall cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company to such an extent that monetary damages alone would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Therefore, in the event that Executive violates any provision of this Section 7, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, in addition to all the other remedies it may have, restraining Executive from violating or continuing to violate such provision. 

(f) Blue Pencil Doctrine. If the duration of, the scope of or any business activity covered by any provision of this Section 7 is in excess of what is determined to be valid and enforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, scope or activity that is determined to be valid and enforceable. Executive hereby acknowledges that this Section 7 shall be given the construction that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent, not exceeding its express terms, possible under applicable law. 

(g) Permitted Equity Ownership. Ownership by Executive, as a passive investment, of less than 2.5% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of any corporation listed on a national securities exchange or publicly traded in the over-the-counter market shall not constitute a breach of this Section 7. 

8. Intellectual Property.

(a) Disclosure and Assignment. As of the Effective Date, Executive hereby transfers and assigns to the Company (or its designee) all right, title, and interest of Executive in and to every idea, concept, invention, and improvement (whether patented, patentable or not) conceived or reduced to practice by Executive whether solely or in collaboration with others while he is employed by the Company, and all copyrighted or copyrightable matter created by Executive whether solely or in collaboration with others while he is employed by the Company that relates to the Company's business (collectively, "Creations"). Executive shall communicate promptly and disclose to the Company, in such form as the Company may request, all information, details, and data pertaining to each Creation. Every copyrightable Creation, regardless of whether copyright protection is sought or preserved by the Company, shall be a "work made for hire" as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101, and the Company shall own all rights in and to such matter throughout the world, without the payment of any royalty or other consideration to Executive or anyone claiming through Executive.

(b) Trademarks. All right, title, and interest in and to any and all trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos adopted, used, or considered for use by the Company during Executive's employment (whether or not developed by Executive) to identify the Company's business or other goods or services (collectively, the "Marks"), together with the goodwill appurtenant thereto, and all other materials, ideas, or other property conceived, created, developed, adopted, or improved by Executive solely or jointly during Executive's employment by the Company and relating to its business shall be owned exclusively by the Company. Executive shall not have, and will not claim to have, any right, title, or interest of any kind in or to the Marks or such other property. 

(c) Documentation. Executive shall execute and deliver to the Company such formal transfers and assignments and such other documents as the Company may request to permit the Company (or its designee) to file and prosecute such registration applications and other documents it deems useful to protect or enforce its rights hereunder. Any idea, invention, copyrightable matter, or other property relating to the Company's business and disclosed by Executive prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of Executive's termination of employment shall be deemed to be governed by the terms of this Section 8 unless proven by Executive to have been first conceived and made after such termination date. 

(d) Non-Applicability.
