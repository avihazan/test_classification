Executive Incentive Plan (“EIP”). Such investment shall be made by the Company applying not more than $50,000 from the Sign-on-Bonus (as specified in Section 4(b) below). In connection with the foregoing and as a condition to the purchase of such shares, Employee agrees to execute such documents and take such other action as may reasonably be required by Company or the Company’s parent, including, but not limited to, executing a subscription agreement in a form satisfactory to the Company’s parent and executing a counterpart to the Investor Stockholders Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2005, by and between the Company’s parent and the stockholders of the Company’s parent.

Section 4. Compensation. Except as otherwise provided for herein, for all services to be performed by the Employee in any capacity hereunder, including without limitation any services as an officer, director, member of any committee, or any other duties assigned him, throughout the Employment Period the Company shall pay or provide Employee with the following, and Employee shall accept the same, as compensation for the performance of his undertakings and the services to be rendered by him:

(a) Base Salary. Initially, Employee will be entitled to an annual salary of One Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars ($190,000) (the “Base Salary”), which shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s policies and procedures. The Base Salary may not be reduced for any reason during the first two years of Employee’s employment with the Company unless the salaries of other comparable level executives with the Company are also reduced. Thereafter, the Employee’s base salary may be changed at annual intervals, based on Employee’s and Company’s performance, which may include, without limitation, participation in a period salary evaluation program on the same basis as other employees of the Company of similar position.

This advance payment shall also be forgiven if Employee is terminated without cause during the first year of this Agreement. Upon termination for cause within the first year of Employee’s employment with the Company, the Company may deduct from Employee’s paycheck(s) or other amounts owed Employee such advance payment (or any other advances previously made to Employee). To the extent that such deductions are insufficient to fully reimburse the Company, Employee shall be liable to the Company for the balance of the advances previously received.

(c) Annual Incentive Compensation.

The Employee’s entitlement to any other compensation or benefits shall be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Benefit Plans and other applicable programs, practices, and arrangements then in effect.

(g) Vacation.

Section 5. Restrictions.

(a) Acknowledgements. Employee acknowledges and agrees that: (1) during the term of Employee’s employment, because of the nature of Employee’s responsibilities and the resources provided by the Company, Employee will acquire valuable and confidential skills, information, trade secrets, and relationships with respect to the Company’s business practices

3

* * *

  


and operations; (2) Employee may develop on behalf of the Company a personal acquaintance and/or relationship with various persons, including, but not limited to, customers and suppliers, which acquaintances may constitute the Employee’s only contact with such persons, and, as a consequence of the foregoing, Employee will occupy a position of trust and confidence with respect to the Company’s affairs; (3) the Business involves the marketing and sale of the Company’s products and services to customers throughout the entire world, that the Company’s competitors, both in the United States and internationally, consist of both domestic and international businesses, and the services to be performed by Employee for the Company involve aspects of both the Company’s domestic and international business; (4) it would be impossible or impractical for Employee to perform his duties for the Company without access to the Company’s confidential and proprietary information and contact with persons that are valuable to the goodwill of the Company. Employee acknowledges that if he went to work for or otherwise performs services for a third party engaged in a business substantially similar to the Business, the disclosure by Employee to a third party of such confidential and proprietary information and/or the exploitation of such relationships would be inevitable.

(b) Reasonableness. In view of the foregoing and in consideration of the remuneration to be paid to Employee, Employee agrees that it is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the goodwill and business of the Company that the Employee make the covenants contained in this Agreement regarding the conduct of Employee during and subsequent to Employee’s employment by the Company, and that the Company will suffer irreparable injury if Employee engages in conduct prohibited by this Agreement.

(c) Non-Compete, (i) During the term of Employee’s employment by the Company, (ii) if Employee’s employment is terminated by Employee or by the Company with cause, then for a period of a period of two (2) years after such termination, or (iii) if Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause prior to the expiration of the two (2) years following the Effective Date, then for a period of twelve (12) month after such termination: neither Employee, nor any other person or entity with Employee’s assistance, nor any entity in which Employee direcdy or indirectly has any interest of any kind (without limitation) shall anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, solicit sales for, invest in, participate in, advise, consult with, or be connected with the ownership, management, operation, or control of any business which is engaged, in whole or in part, in the Business, or any business that is competitive therewith or any portion thereof, except for the exclusive benefit of the Company.

(d) No Raiding. In addition, (i) during the term of Employee’s employment by the Company, (ii) if Employee’s employment is terminated by Employee or by the Company with cause, then for a period of a period of two (2) years after such termination, or (iii) if Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause prior to the expiration of the two (2) years following the Effective Date, then for a period of twelve (12) month after such termination: neither the Employee nor any person or entity with his assistance nor any entity which the Employee or any person with his assistance or any person who he directly or indirectly controls shall, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit or take any action to induce any employee to quit or terminate their employment with the Company or the Company’s affiliates, or (2) employ as an

This paragraph shall not apply to any such information that: (1) Employee is required to disclose by law; (2) has been otherwise disseminated, disclosed, or made available to the public; (3) was obtained after his employment with the Company ended and from some source other than the Company, which source was under no obligation of confidentiality.

(f) Effect of Breach.

(g) Other Rights Preserved. Nothing in this Section eliminates or diminishes rights which the Company may have with respect to the subject matter hereof under other agreements, the governing statutes, or under provisions of law, equity, or otherwise.

(b) If Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company prior to the expiration of two (2) years following the Effective Date for any reason other than Cause and for so long as Employee is not in breach of his continuing obligations under Section 5, the Company shall (i) continue to pay Employee an amount equal to his Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the termination of his employment for a period of twelve (12) months (less any amounts the Company may off-set or deduct as specified in this Agreement), and (ii) pay the costs of COBRA medical and dental benefits coverage which are offered to Employee after termination for a period of twelve (12) months.

* * *

  


any of its provisions is invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void) or the dealings or relationship between Employee and the Company (“Disputes”) to mediation in Wichita, Kansas and in accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect.

The award and decision of the arbitrator will be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as specified above, the Company and Employee shall pay their respective attorneys’ fee and other costs associated with the arbitration, and the Company and Employee shall equally bear the costs and fees of the arbitrator.

(c) Confidentiality.

(d) Injunctions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9, the Company and Employee shall have the right in a proper case to obtain temporary restraining orders and temporary or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Company and Employee must contemporaneously

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, and Employee and shall be enforceable by them and Employee’s heirs, legatees, legal personal representatives.

(e) Counterparts. The Company and Employee may execute this Agreement in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute but one instrument. In proving this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.

(f) Invalidity of Provisions. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall declare that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, and if the rights and obligations of the Parties to this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision the court may add as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid, and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as is possible. If such court cannot so substitute or declines to so substitute for such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision, (i) such provision will be fully severable; (ii) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom. The covenants contained in this Agreement shall each be construed to be a separate agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against the Company, predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any of said covenants.

(g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the documents expressly referenced herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, supersedes in all respects any prior agreement between the Company and Employee and may not be changed except by a writing duly executed and delivered by the Company and Employee in the same manner as this Agreement.
