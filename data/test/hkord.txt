AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO  


This Amendment No. 1 to Employment Agreement (this “Amendment”) is effective as of June 5, 2014, by and between Advaxis, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Sara Bonstein (“Executive”).

WHEREAS, the Company and Executive entered into an Employment Agreement, effective as of March 24, 2014 (the “Agreemen”), pursuant to which the Company employed Executive in the capacity, for the period, and on the terms and conditions set forth therein; and

WHEREAS, Section 3(a) of the Agreement provided that the Executive’s Base Salary (as such term is defined in the Agreement) shall be paid through a Cash Component and a Stock Component;

WHEREAS, the Company and Executive desire to enter into this Amendment pursuant to which Section 3(a) of the Agreement shall be amended and restated to set forth the terms and conditions relating to the payment of salary to Executive so that the Stock Component shall be paid in a different manner than set forth in the Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company made an offer of employment to the Executive on February 6, 2014 which contained certain terms, including the issuance of 100,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Inducement Grant”) as an inducement for Executive to accept employment with the Company and commence her employment with the Company on February 24, 2014, and it is now desirable to set forth in greater detail the terms of such Inducement Grant so that such shares may now be issued.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1\. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 3(a). Section 3(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

“(a) SALARY. Executive shall receive an annual salary of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000.00), plus annual cost of living (COLA—as determined by the Social Security Administration) salary increases commencing on the one-year anniversary of the execution of this Agreement (“Base Salary”). The applicable Base Salary shall be reviewed by the Board immediately following the end of the Company’s fiscal year to determine the annual increase, or decrease consistent with the Company’s decrease in the base salaries of other senior executives, to the applicable year’s Base Salary; provided, however, that in no event shall such annual increase be less than the cost of living increase. The Base Salary shall be paid in two components, as follows: (a) Ninety Two and one-half percent (92.5%) of the Base Salary shall be paid in cash (the “Cash Component”), and (b) Seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Base Salary shall be paid in the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) (referred to as the “Stock Component”) as set forth below.

“(i) The applicable Cash Component will be paid in equal installments not less frequently than bi-monthly in accordance with the Company’s salary payment practices and employment tax withholding obligations in effect from time to time for senior executives of the Company.

1  
  
“(ii) The applicable Stock Component will be paid on the last business day of each calendar month (if Executive has provided services to the Company in accordance with the Agreement through such date) (each such date, a “Purchase Date”) as follows: the Company shall withhold an amount equal to 7.5% of the Executive Base Salary from each salary payment date described in Section 3(a)(i) that falls within such calendar month and use such funds on the Purchase Date to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) from the Company at a purchase price equal to the consolidated closing bid price of the Common Stock on the Purchase Date.

“(iii) At the time of issuance of the Common Stock as described in Section 3(a)(ii) above, or any time thereafter as determined by the Company to be necessary or appropriate, Executive authorizes withholding of all applicable tax obligations from payroll and any other amounts payable to Executive, and otherwise agrees to make adequate arrangements, as approved at the discretion of the Company, for the applicable tax obligations in connection with the issuance of the Common Stock. Subject to compliance with applicable law, the Company, at its sole discretion, may permit Executive to satisfy all or any portion of the tax obligations by deducting from shares of Common Stock to be issued to Executive a number of whole shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company, not in excess of the amount of the tax obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.

“(iv) Executive acknowledges and agrees that as of the date hereof, the Company has not filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any other registration form) that covers the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the shares of Common Stock received by Executive pursuant to this Section 3(a) may not be sold by Executive except pursuant to an applicable registration statement or exemption from registration. No Common Stock shall be issued in connection with a grant hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the issuance of such Common Stock have been complied with. Each grant made shall be conditioned on Executive’s undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on his subsequent disposition of such shares of Common Stock, and certificates representing such shares may be legended to reflect any such restrictions. Certificates representing shares of Common Stock issued or transferred hereunder will be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as may be required by applicable laws, regulations and interpretations, including any requirement that a legend be placed thereon.

“(v) Executive shall not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until immediately following the issuance of any such shares of Common Stock in accordance herewith.

“(vi) Executive understands and agrees that the Company has not advised Executive regarding Executive’s income tax liability in connection with the issuance of stock as contemplated hereunder. Executive has reviewed with Executive’s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the Common Stock and the transactions contemplated hereby. Executive is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. Executive understands that, except as otherwise specifically provided in the Agreement, Executive (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Executive’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of an investment in the Common Stock or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.”

2  
  
2\. INSERTION OF NEW SECTION 3(g). The Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following Section and Exhibit:

“(g) RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD. As soon as reasonably practical following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Executive shall receive a stock award for 100,000 restricted stock units under the terms and conditions set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.”

3\. MISCELLANEOUS.

(a) The provisions of Sections 8 (‘Notices’), 9 (‘Legal Representation’), 11 (‘Governing Law’), 12 (‘Assignment’), 13 (’Severability’), 15 (‘Remedies’), 16 (‘Dispute Resolution’) of the Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in full herein, mutatis mutandis.

(b) Except as provided herein, the terms of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Agreement (together with Exhibit A thereto), as amended hereby, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, with respect to the same. No modification, alteration, amendment or revision of or supplement to the Agreement, as amended hereby, shall be valid or effective unless the same is in writing and signed by both parties hereto. Email correspondence does not constitute a writing for the purposes of this provision.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment No. 1 to Employment Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Upon the later of (a) the Grant Date and (b) the date the Notice shall have been fully executed, the Participant shall acquire and the Corporation shall issue, subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement, a number of Shares equal to the Total Number of Restricted Stock set forth in the Notice.

3.2 Beneficial Ownership of Shares; Certificate Registration

The Participant hereby authorizes the Corporation, in its sole discretion, to deposit the Shares with the Corporation’s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form during the term of the Escrow pursuant to Section 6\. Furthermore, the Participant hereby authorizes the Corporation, in its sole discretion, to deposit, following the term of such Escrow, for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Corporation has notice any or all Shares which are no longer subject to such Escrow.

5  
  
3.3 Issuance of Shares in Compliance with Law

The issuance of the Shares shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. No Shares shall be issued hereunder if their issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the stock may then be listed. The inability of the Corporation to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Corporation’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares shall relieve the Corporation of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the issuance of the Shares, the Corporation may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Corporation.

3.4 No Monetary Payment Required

The Participant is not required to make any monetary payment (other than to satisfy applicable tax withholding, if any, with respect to the issuance or vesting of the Shares) as a condition to receiving the Shares, the consideration for which shall be services actually rendered or future services to be rendered to the Corporation or for its benefit.

In the event of a termination of service due to Participant’s death or Total Disability, the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award shall immediately be deemed Vested Shares.

6  
  
6\. Escrow

6.1 Appointment of Agent

To ensure that Shares subject to the Corporation Reacquisition Right will be available for reacquisition, the Participant and the Corporation may appoint a person or Corporation as their agent and as attorney-in-fact for the Participant (the “Agent”) to hold any and all Unvested Shares and to sell, assign and transfer to the Corporation any such Unvested Shares reacquired by the Corporation pursuant to the Corporation Reacquisition Right. The Participant understands that appointment of the Agent is a material inducement to make this Restricted Stock Award and that such appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The Agent shall not be personally liable for any act the Agent may do or omit to do hereunder as escrow agent, agent for the Corporation, or attorney in fact for the Participant while acting in good faith and in the exercise of the Agent’s own good judgment, and any act done or omitted by the Agent pursuant to the advice of the Agent’s own attorneys shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Agent may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purporting to be genuine and may resign at any time.

6.2 Establishment of Escrow

The Participant authorizes the Corporation to deposit the unvested Shares with the Corporation’s transfer agent to be held in book entry form, as provided in Section 3.2, and the Participant agrees to deliver to and deposit with the Agent each certificate, if any, evidencing the Shares and an Assignment Separate from Certificate with respect to such book entry Shares and each such certificate duly endorsed (with date and number of Shares blank) in the form attached to the Award Agreement, to be held by the Agent under the terms and conditions of this Section 6 (the “Escrow”). Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or a change, as described in Section 8, in the character or amount of any outstanding stock of the corporation the stock of which is subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which the Participant is entitled by reason of his ownership of the Shares that remain, following such Change in Control or change described in Section 8, subject to the Corporation Reacquisition Right shall be immediately subject to the Escrow to the same extent as the Shares immediately before such event. The Corporation shall bear the expenses of the Escrow.

6.3 Delivery of Shares to Participant

The Escrow shall continue with respect to any Shares for so long as such Shares remain subject to the Corporation Reacquisition Right. Upon termination of the Reacquisition Right with respect to Shares, the Corporation shall so notify the Agent and direct the Agent to deliver such number of Shares to the Participant. As soon as practicable after receipt of such notice, the Agent shall cause to be delivered to the Participant the Shares specified by such notice, and the Escrow shall terminate with respect to such Shares.

7  
  
7\. Board Discretion

The Board, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock at any time, subject to the terms of the Award. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Board.

8\. Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, one hundred percent (100%) of the Restricted Stock subject to this Award will vest on the date of the Change of Control. In the event that any applicable law limits the Corporation’s ability to accelerate the vesting of this Award, this Section 8 will be limited to the extent required to comply with applicable law.

9\. Tax Withholding

9.1 In General

Regardless of any action taken by the Corporation with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding obligations (the “Tax Obligations”), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and that the Corporation (a) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the award, the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to such settlement, or the receipt of any dividends and (b) does not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any other aspect of the award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax Obligations. The Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation to satisfy all Tax Obligations of the Corporation and any other Participating Corporation at the time such Tax Obligations arise. In this regard, at the time the award is settled, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Corporation or any other Participating Corporation, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding of all applicable Tax Obligations from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for withholding of all applicable Tax Obligations, if any, by each Participating Corporation which arise in connection with the award. The Corporation shall have no obligation to process the settlement of the award or to deliver shares until the Tax Obligations as described in this Section have been satisfied by the Participant.

9.2 Withholding in Shares

Subject to compliance with applicable law, the Corporation may require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of the Tax Obligations by deducting from Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Corporation as of the date on which the Tax Obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such Tax Obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.

8  
  
10\. Rights as Stockholder

Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Corporation in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Corporation or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this Terms and Conditions, any quarterly or other regular, periodic dividends or distributions (as determined by the Corporation) paid on Shares will not affect unvested Restricted Stock, and no such dividends or other distributions will be paid on unvested Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock that are vested but unpaid. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.

11\. No Effect on Employment

Subject to any employment contract with the Participant, the terms of such employment will be determined from time to time by the Corporation, or the affiliate employing the Participant, as the case may be, and the Corporation, or the affiliate employing the Participant, as the case may be, will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time. A leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Corporation or the affiliate employing the Participant, as the case may be, will not be deemed a termination of service for the purposes of this Award.

12\. Changes in Shares

In the event that as a result of a stock or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization, combination of the Shares or the adjustment in capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, or as a result of a merger, consolidation, spin-off or other corporate transaction or event, the Restricted Stock will be increased, reduced or otherwise affected, and by virtue of any such event the Participant will in his capacity as owner of unvested Restricted Stock that have been awarded to him (the “Prior Restricted Stock”) be entitled to new or additional or different shares of stock, cash or other securities or property (other than rights or warrants to purchase securities); such new or additional or different Stocks, cash or securities or property will thereupon be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions that were applicable to the Prior Restricted Stock pursuant to the Notice and Terms and Conditions. If the Participant receives rights or warrants with respect to any Prior Restricted Stock, such rights or warrants may be held or exercised by the Participant, provided that until such exercise, any such rights or warrants, and after such exercise, any shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants, will be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions that were applicable to the Prior Restricted Stock pursuant to the Notice and Terms and Conditions. The Board in its sole discretion at any time may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of such new or additional shares of stock, cash or securities, rights or warrants to purchase securities or shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants.

13\. Address for Notices

S. state or federal governmental agency, which the Board will, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the date of vesting of the Restricted Stock as the Board may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience.

18\. Agreement Severable

In the event that any provision in the Notice or the Terms and Conditions is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Award.
