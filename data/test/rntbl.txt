This Article is not intended to limit the ability of Executive to terminate the employment of Company employees in the course and scope of his position with Company. 

ARTICLE 2: TERM AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

2.1 Term. Unless sooner terminated pursuant to other provisions hereof, Company agrees to employ Executive for a thirty-nine (39) month period beginning on the Effective Date and concluding on December 31, 2009 (“Term”).

(d) for any other reason whatsoever, in the sole discretion of Executive. 

For purposes of this Agreement: (i) a termination of employment by Executive under clauses (a) through (c) above shall constitute a termination of employment by Executive for “Good Reason;” and (ii) a termination of employment by Executive under clause (d) above shall constitute a termination of employment by Executive “without Good Reason”. 

2.4 Notice of Termination. Notwithstanding the provisions in Article 2.1 herein relating to the Term of this Agreement, if Company or Executive desires to terminate Executive’s employment hereunder at any time prior to expiration of the Term of employment as provided in Article 2.1, it or he shall do so by giving a minimum of fifteen (15) days written notice to the other party that it or he has elected to terminate Executive’s employment hereunder and stating the effective date and reason for such termination, provided that no such action shall alter or amend any other provisions hereof or rights arising hereunder.

pay dates regarding payment of compensation to executives and shall be subject to applicable withholding and deductions. 

3.2 Executive Health and Welfare Benefits. Executive shall be entitled to participate in Company’s insurance plans (medical, dental, life and disability), during the term of this Agreement. Upon termination of Executive’s employment under Articles 2.2(a), 2.2(b), 2.2(d), 2.3(a), 2.3(b) or 2.3(c) and for the remaining Term under this Agreement but not less than two (2) years thereafter, Company shall continue to provide Executive with insurance benefits (medical, dental, life and disability) which Executive was receiving or entitled to receive at the time of his termination of employment, with all costs paid by Company. Company, shall, however, issue Executive a COBRA notice upon the termination of his employment. Such insurance benefits shall be discontinued to the extent Executive is eligible to receive comparable coverage from a subsequent employer and/or except to the extent that the subsequent employer’s plan does not cover the preexisting medical conditions of the Executive or a previously covered member of the Executive’s family. 

3.3 Other Benefits/Compensation. During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to participate in such employee benefit and compensation programs, plans and policies as are maintained by Company and as may be established for employees of Company from time to time on the same basis as other executive employees are entitled thereto. These include plans or policies relating to funded and unfunded executive benefits, such as bonus compensation, vacation time, leave time, retirement plans and stock plans. It is understood that the establishment, termination or change in any such executive employee benefit program, plan or policy may be made by the Company in the exercise of its sole discretion, from time to time, and any such termination or change in such program, plan or policy will not constitute a modification to this Agreement so long as Executive is permitted to participate in such program, plan or policy, as the case may be, as is available to other executives. Upon termination of employment, without regard to the manner in which the termination was brought about, Executive’s rights in such employee benefit and compensation programs, plans or policies shall be governed solely by the terms of the program, plan or policy itself unless otherwise stated to the contrary herein. 

3.4 Management Performance Bonus Program. Unless sooner terminated by operation of this Agreement, the provisions of this article 3.4 shall apply during the initial-three year term of this Agreement and terminate on September 30, 2009 (the “Bonus Term”).

Under the terms of the Company’s current Bonus Plans, Executive has an opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus (“Bonus Amount”) measured against objective financial performance criteria to be determined by the board of directors of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (or a committee thereof), at its sole discretion. The desired but not guaranteed target Bonus Amount is equal to a range between 60% and 65% of Executive’s Base Salary, and in no event shall the Bonus Amount payable in any given year exceed 100% of Executive’s Base Salary.

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, Company shall pay any Accrued Obligations and/or any amounts owed but unpaid to Executive under any plan, policy or program of Company as of the Date of Termination provided by, and in accordance with the terms of, such plan, policy or program;

4.3 Payment Obligations Absolute/Release of Claims. Except as set forth in the following Article, Company’s obligation to pay Executive the amounts and to make the arrangements provided in this Article 4 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which Company (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may have against him or anyone else. All amounts payable by Company shall be paid without notice or demand. Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Article 4, and the obtaining of any such other employment (or the engagement in any endeavor as an independent contractor, sole proprietor, partner, or joint venturer) shall in no event effect any reduction of Company’s obligations to make (or cause to be made) the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Article 4. 

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the payments and benefits provided for in Article 4.1 constitute the exclusive remedy of Executive upon termination of employment for any reason. Executive further agrees that, as a condition to receiving such payments and benefits, Executive (or, if deceased or disabled, his estate or legal guardian) shall execute a complete and global release of claims relating to or arising out of his employment with, and termination of employment from, Company in a reasonable and customary form acceptable to Company. In the absence of Executive’s execution and delivery to Company of such a release, Company shall have no obligation to Executive to make any payment of the benefits as provided for in Article 4.1.

4.5 Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Any amounts that were otherwise scheduled to be paid during such six (6) month period shall be paid in a lump sum upon expiration of such six (6) month period with all accrued interest calculated from the Date of Termination until such lump sum payment and equal to the average six (6) month U.S. Treasury Rate for the year. To the extent that the provision of any other payments or benefits under this Agreement are governed by Section 409A, as amended, the parties will work together in good faith to amend any provisions necessary for compliance or make payments in a manner to avoid or minimize excise tax,
