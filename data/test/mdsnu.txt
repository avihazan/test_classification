Entity and for a period of (i) one (1) year immediately following termination of the Employee’s employment with the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity, if such termination is without Cause (as defined in Section 12(b) below), or (ii) two (2) years immediately following termination of the Employee’s employment with the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity for Cause or in the event of termination of employment by the Employee for any reason, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in or have any interest in, or assist or render services (whether or not for compensation, and whether as a director, officer, managing member, partner, shareholder, creditor, employee, agent, advisor or consultant) to or for any sole proprietorship, corporation, company, limited liability company, partnership, association, venture or business or any other person or entity (whether as an employee, officer, director, partner, shareholder, managing member, venturer, agent, security or equity holder, creditor, consultant or otherwise) that directly (or through any affiliated entity) competes or expects to compete with the Broadway Ticketing Division’s business anywhere in the United States, Canada or Europe; provided, however, that this Section 9(a) shall not prohibit the Employee’s ownership, solely as an investment, of securities of any issuer that are registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that are listed or admitted for trading on any United States national securities exchange or that are quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System, or any similar system or automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices in common use, so long as the Employee does not (A) directly or indirectly own (legally or beneficially) or control more than five perce nt (5%) of any class of capital stock or other equity of such issuer, or (B) control, acquire a controlling interest in or become a member of a group which exceeds such five percent (5%) ownership or exercises direct or indirect control of such issuer. For purposes hereof, the Broadway Ticketing Division’s business shall mean the on-line and off-line Broadway and off-Broadway ticketing of the Broadway Ticketing Division, any other live theater ticketing that the Broadway Ticketing Division has provided within six (6) months of the date of termination of the Employee’s employment, and any and all businesses operated by the Broadway Ticketing Division and its affiliates on the date of termination of the Employee’s employment.

(b) 

Covenant Not to Solicit or Interfere. Except in connection with his performance of services for the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity, the Employee agrees during the Term and for a period of (i) one (1) year immediately following termination of the Employee’s employment with the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity, if such termination is without cause (as defined in Section 12(b) below), or (ii) two (2) years immediately following termination of the Employee’s employment with the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity for Cause or in the event of termination of employment by the Employee for any reason, the Employee shall not interfere with the business of the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity within the United States, Canada or Europe in any manner for the purpose of (A) hiring away any employees of the Broadway Ticketing Division or a ny HMC Entity, or (B) soliciting customers or business relationships of the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity.

than in connection with the performance of his employment duties for the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity, nor shall the Employee divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of the Broadway Ticketing Division or any HMC Entity.

  


(c) 

Blue Pencilling. In the event any provision of this Section 9 is held by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless   
continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way. Without in any way limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event the covenant not to compete contained herein and/or the   
non-solicitation covenant contained herein, in the view of a court or arbitrator asked to rule upon the issue, is deemed unenforceable by reason of covering too large an area, too long a period of time or too many   
business activities, then the same shall be deemed to cover only the largest area, the longest time period or the most business activities, as the case may be, which will not render it unenforceable (as determined by the court   
or arbitrator, as applicable).

  


(d) 

It is expressly recognized and agreed that the covenants set forth in this Section 9 are for the purposes of restricting the activities of the Employee only to the extent necessary for the protection of the legitimate business interests of the Broadway Ticketing Division and the HMC Entities, and the Broadway Ticketing Division and the Employee agree that said covenants are reasonable for that purpose and that such covenants do not and will not preclude the Employee from engaging in activities sufficient for the purpose of earning a living. 

  


10.

Proprietary Information. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that certain non-public information obtained by the Employee relating or pertaining to the Broadway Ticketing Division’s businesses, projects, products, services, trade secrets, confidential information (including methods of operations and financial information), unpublished know-how (whether patented or unpatented) and other business information not easily accessible to other persons in the trade and which give the Broadway Ticketing Division a competitive advantage and which the Broadway Ticketing Division takes steps to keep confidential (collectively, the “Proprietary Information”), are proprietary in nature; provided, however, there shall be excluded from the meaning of Proprietary Information any information which is or becomes generally known within the industry through some non-conf idential source other than the Employee. The Employee acknowledges that the Proprietary Information shall be considered by the Employee to be confidential, and the Employee covenants and agrees not to publish, disclose or reveal (whether directly or indirectly) any part of the Proprietary Information to any entity or person or use the same for his/her own purposes or personal gain or the purposes of other, during the term of this Agreement or after its termination or expiration. Upon termination (voluntary or otherwise) of the Employee’s employment with the Broadway Ticketing Division, the Employee will return to the Broadway Ticketing Division all things belonging to the Broadway Ticketing Division, and all documents, records, notebooks and tangible articles containing or embodying any Proprietary Information, including copies thereof, then in the Employee’s possession or control, whether prepared by the Employee or others, will be left with the Broadway Ticketing Division.

Termination. 

  


(a)

Death or Disability. In the event the Employee dies or becomes disabled during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate on the date on which death or disability occurs and the sole remaining obligations of the Broadway Ticketing Division under this Agreement shall be to pay the Employee or the Employee’s named beneficiary or heirs any unpaid Base Salary or bonus amounts due the Employee for the period through and until the date of the Employee’s disability or death and any unreimbursed previously approved business expenses.

(b)

Cause. The Broadway Ticketing Division may terminate the Employee’s employment and all of the Broadway Ticketing Division’s and HMC’s obligations hereunder solely for Cause (as defined below), by written notice to the Employee particularizing the conduct constituting the Cause.

In the event the Broadway Ticketing Division terminates this Agreement for Cause or in the event the Employee voluntarily resigns from the emplo yment of the Broadway Ticketing Division for any reason or by reason of disability or death, the Broadway Ticketing Division shall no longer be obligated to make any further salary, bonus or other payments to the Employee except insofar as they have accrued as of the date the Employee’s employment terminates. Other than as expressly set forth hereinabove, upon any such termination, the Employee shall cease to have any future rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3(c) herein.

  


(c)

Other. The Broadway Ticketing Division may, upon sixty (60) days’ notice, terminate the Employee’s employment for reasons other than for Cause, in the sole discretion of the Broadway Ticketing Division, by written notice to the Employee. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Broadway Ticketing Division other than for Cause, death or disability, upon the Employee’s prior voluntary execution of a written release of any and all claims the Employee may assert against the Broadway Ticketing Division, HMC or any HMC Entity, including without limitation any claims for lost wages or benefits, stock options, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, equitable relief or any other form of damages or relief (excluding claims for amounts which may be payable

pursuant to this Agreement), which release shall be mutually agreed upon by the Employee and the Broadway Ticketing Division, the Broadway Ticketing Division shall be obligated to pay the Employee (which shall constitute HMC’s sole obligation hereunder) (i) any Bonus due and owing as calculated hereinabove as of the date of such termination and (ii) a cash payment equal to either (A) the Base Salary described in Section 3 for the shorter of (1) the remainder of the Employment Period and (2) one year after the date of such termination or (B) the Change of Control bonus set forth in Section 3(c)(iii)(B) above, if earned in accordance with the terms thereof. Other than as expressly set forth hereinabove, upon any such termination, the Employee shall cease to have any further rights under this Agreement.

Arbitration.

Moreover, nothing herein shall restrict any resort to any statutory agency charged with enforcing any of the Employee’s, the Broadway Ticketing Division’s or HMC’s statutory rights and/or remedies; however the review of any such agency’s actions shall be had before the arbitrators as discussed above and not before a judge or jury. By signing this Agreement, the Employee understands that the Employee may not have a jury decide any dispute or claim, but that any such dispute or claim shall be decided only by the arbitrators. The arbitrators shall issue a written decision, including the arbitrators’ written findings and conclusions upon which any award is based.
