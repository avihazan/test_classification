(c) All payments of severance under this Agreement shall accrue from the date of Termination of Employment and shall commence no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive’s Termination of Employment, with any accrued but unpaid severance being paid on the date of the first payment. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall at all times be interpreted and operated in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, as amended and the standards, regulations or other guidance promulgated thereunder (“Section 409A”).

Each payment hereunder shall be deemed a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. The parties intend that no payment pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any adverse tax consequences to either party pursuant to Section 409A; however, Executive acknowledges that the Bank does not guarantee any particular tax treatment and that Executive is solely responsible for any taxes owed as a result of this Agreement.

(b) If the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank’s affairs by a notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank shall (1) pay the Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended and (2) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were suspended.

  


(c) If the Bank is in default (as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the FDIA), all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but the vested rights of the parties shall not be affected.

  


(d) All obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated, except to the extent a determination is made that continuation of the contract is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank (1) by the director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or his or her designee (the “Director”), at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in 13(c) of the FDIA; or (2) by the Director, at the time the Director approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation of the Bank when the Bank is determined by the Director to be in an unsafe and unsound condition. Any rights of the Executive that have already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action.

4.4 TARP Treatment. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, this Agreement shall at all times be interpreted and operated in compliance with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement between the United States Department of the Treasury and the Company and Section 111(b)(3)(D) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (collectively with 31 C.F.R. Section 30.1 and other any standards, regulations or other guidance promulgated under Section 111(b)(3)(D), or any amendments thereto under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 or otherwise, the “TARP Restrictions”) and all payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be subject to, and their payment or granting conditioned on, the Company’s compliance with the TARP Restrictions.
