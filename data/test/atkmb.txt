Executive agrees that he will have no right in or to such properties or works and shall not use such properties or works for his own benefit or the benefit of any other person. Executive shall, at the request of the Company, execute such assignments, certificates, applications, filings, instruments or other documents, consistent herewith, as the Company may from time to time reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, perfect, protect, enforce or defend its right, title and interest in or to any such properties or works.

5.2 Severability of Covenants. If any court determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Restrictive Covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portions. 

5.3 Blue-Pencilling. If any court construes any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, to be unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or area of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.
