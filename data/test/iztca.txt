A physician satisfactory to Employee and the Company will determine if Employee is disabled.

The determination of the physician(s) as to disability will be binding on all parties.

6\. Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

  


6.1 Non-Competition. During the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term (regardless whether the Original Term or the applicable Additional Term are terminated under Section 4 above prior to its scheduled expiration under Section 1) and for a period of one year after the expiration of the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term, Employee will not, including through an Affiliate (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), directly or indirectly, engage in the business in which the Company or its Affiliates are actually engaged in as of the date of termination or expiration, as applicable (the “Business”). Each of the following activities, without limitation, are deemed to constitute engaged in the Business: engaging in, working with, maintaining an interest in (other than interests of less than 1% in companies with securities traded either on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market or traded over-the-counter and quoted on the Bulletin Board), advising for a fee or other consideration, managing, operating, lending money to (other than loans by commercial banks), guaranteeing the debts or obligations of, or permitting one’s name or any part thereof to be used in connection with an enterprise or endeavor, either individually, in partnership or in conjunction with any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, joint stock company, trust, joint venture or any other form of business organization, unincorporated organization or governmental entity (or any department, agency or subdivision thereof) (each, a “Person”), whether as principal, director, agent, shareholder, partner, employee, consultant, independent contractor or in any other manner whatsoever, any Person in the Business.

  


6.2 Non-solicitation. During the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term (regardless whether the Original Term or the applicable Additional Term are terminated under Section 4 above prior to its scheduled expiration under Section 1) and for a period of one year after the expiration of the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, and no Person (including an Affiliate) over which Employee exercises control (whether as an officer, director, individual proprietor, holder of debt or equity securities, consultant, partner, member or otherwise) (a) solicit or engage or employ or otherwise enter into any agreement or understanding, written or oral, relating to the services of any Person who is known or should be known by Employee to be then employed or to have been employed within the preceding six months by the Company or its Affiliates, (b) take any action which could be reasonably expected to lead any Person to cease to deal with the Company or its Affiliates or (c) solicit the business of, enter into any written or oral agreement with or otherwise deal with any supplier of goods, products, materials or services in competition with the Company or its Affiliates or solicit the business of customers of the Company or its Affiliates who were such at any time during the two-year period preceding Employee’s last date of employment, except on behalf of businesses in which such party would then be permitted to engage directly without violating this Section 6.

* * *

  


6.3 Confidentiality. During the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term (regardless whether the Original Term or the applicable Additional Term are terminated under Section 4 above prior to its scheduled expiration under Section 1) and for a period of five years after the expiration of the Original Term and, if automatically renewed, the applicable Additional Term, Employee will treat as trade secrets all Confidential Information (as defined below) known or acquired by Employee in the course of any affiliation Employee has with the Company or its Affiliates and will not disclose any Confidential Information to any Person not affiliated with the Company except as authorized in writing by the Company. “Confidential Information” means any information relating to the relationship of the Company or its Affiliates to their customers (including, without limitation, the identity of any customer), the research, design, development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing, costs, capabilities, capacities and business plans related to the Business, the financing arrangements of the Company, or the financial condition or prospects of the Company; inventions, products, processes, methods, techniques, formulas, compositions, compounds, projects, developments, plans, research data, clinical data, financial data, personnel data, computer programs, software, including source code, object code, operating systems, bridgeware, firmware, middleware or utilities and customer and supplier lists and any other confidential information relating to the assets, condition or business of the Company or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee will have no obligation with respect to (a) information disclosed to Employee by a Person who does not owe a duty of confidentiality to the Company or its Affiliates; or (b) information which is in the public domain and is readily available; or (c) information where disclosure is required by law or is necessary in connection with a claim, dispute or litigation to which Employee is or becomes a party and the Company is given ten business days prior written notice of the intent to make disclosure.

  


6.4 Injunctive Relief. The restrictions contained in this Section 6 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Company and its Affiliates and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by Employee of the covenants contained in this Section 6 would cause the Company irreparable harm and that the extent of damages to the Company would be impossible to ascertain and that there is and will be available to the Company no adequate monetary damages or other remedy at law to compensate it in the event of any such breach. Consequently, in the event of a breach of any such covenant, in addition to any other relief to which the Company is or may be entitled, the Company may seek, as a matter of course, an injunction or other equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, to enforce any or all of such covenants by Employee, his employer, employees, partners, agents or any of them.

  


6.5 Modification of Covenants. In the event an arbitrator, court or governmental agency or authority determines that any provision of Section 6 is invalid by reason of the length of any period of time or the size of any area during or in which such provision is effective, such period of time or area will be considered to be reduced to the extent required to cure such invalidity.

  


6.6 Extension of Covenant. In the event Employee violates the restrictions contained in Section 6.1, the duration of such restriction will extend for a period of time equal to the period of time during which such violation continued.

  


6.7 Counter-claims. Any claim or cause of action by Employee against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the restrictions contained in this Section 6, but will be litigated separately including, without limitation, any claim by Employee that Employee has not been terminated for cause pursuant to Section 4.2 above, unless the claim and defense arise out of the same event and joinder would be required.

* * *

Employee hereby assigns to the Company all Inventions and any and all related patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and other industrial and intellectual property rights and applications therefor, in the United States and elsewhere and appoints any officer of the Company as Employee’s duly authorized attorney to execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before any government agency, court or authority. Upon the request of the Company and at the Company’s expense, Employee will execute such further assignments, documents and other instruments as may be necessary or desirable to fully and completely assign all Inventions to the Company and to assist the Company in applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents or copyrights or other rights in the United States and in any foreign country with respect to any Invention.

All files, letters, memoranda, reports, records, data, sketches, drawings, laboratory notebooks, program listings or other written, photographic or other tangible material, in each event, containing Confidential Information, whether created by Employee or others, which come into Employee’s custody or possession, are and will be the exclusive property of the Company to be used by Employee only in the performance of his duties for the Company.

  


9\. Cooperation. At any time during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, Employee will reasonably cooperate with the Company in any litigation or administrative proceedings involving any matters with which Employee was involved during Employee’s employment by the Company. The Company will reimburse Employee for reasonable expenses, if any, incurred in providing such assistance.
