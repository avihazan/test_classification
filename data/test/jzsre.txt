c) 5 p.m. Central Standard Time on the first anniversary of the Termination Date following the Option Holder’s termination of employment or service due to disability or death (or death within the ninety (90) day period following the Termination Date where the termination is due to the Option Holder’s termination without Cause).

without Cause) and prior to the Expiration Date, the Option may be exercised, to the extent vested on the date of the Option Holder’s death or disability, at any time prior to the time and date specified in Section 4(c) hereof by (i) the Option Holder’s estate or a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Option Holder in the event the Option Holder’s death, or (ii) the Option Holder or his personal representative or attorney-in-fact in the event of the Option Holder’s disability, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the Plan and applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

  
  
  
6.

Restrictions on Exercise. This Option:  
  
  
  
  
a)

may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Option. If the Option vests with respect to a fractional share, such installment will be rounded to the next highest whole number of shares, except for the final installment, which will be for the balance of the shares subject to the Option. The Company will pay cash to the Option Holder in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 7 of this agreement) of any fractional share in lieu of issuing a fractional share, and the Option Holder will not have any rights with respect to the fractional share;  
  
b)

may be exercised, in full or in part, only with respect to the vested portion of the Option; and  
  
c)

may not be exercised, in whole or in part, if any requisite approval or consent of any government authority of any kind or having jurisdiction over the exercise of options shall not have been obtained.   
  
  
  
  
7.

Manner of Exercise. Subject to such administrative regulations as the Committee may from time to time adopt, the Option Holder (or, in the event of Option Holder’s death or disability, the Option Holder’s attorney-in-fact, estate or heirs, as the case may be) shall, in order to exercise the Option, deliver to the Company an executed exercise agreement, on a form provided by the Committee. If someone other than the Option Holder exercises the Option, then such person must also submit documentation reasonably acceptable to the Committee verifying that such person has the legal right to exercise the Option. The exercise agreement must state the number of shares that the Option Holder will purchase and must be accompanied by full payment of the Option Exercise Price and applicable tax withholding. In the discretion of the Committee, payment of the Option Exercise Price and applicable tax withholding shall be made in the form of a “net exercise” (pursuant to which the Company, or its authorized delegate, withholds from the shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise of the Option that number of shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the Option Exercise Price and necessary to satisfy applicable tax withholding), cash, a “sell-to-cover” or “cashless exercise” transaction through a broker-dealer (subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan), wire transfer, certified check, or bank draft, or any other method that is not inconsistent with the Plan, and additionally, the Committee may permit payment of the Option Exercise Price (but not the applicable tax withholding) to be made through the delivery of unrestricted shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Option Exercise Price

and owned by the Option Holder for a period of at least 6 months (or such shorter or longer period of time as is necessary for the Company to avoid a charge to earnings on its financial statements). For purposes of this Section 7, the “Fair Market Value” of the shares of the Company’s Common Stock shall be the sales price for such shares on the NASDAQ National Market at the time of sale on the date of exercise. Except to the extent otherwise authorized by the Committee, a stock certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of the Option will not be issued, and the Option Holder will not have the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares until the Company receives full payment of the Option Exercise Price and applicable tax withholding.

  
  
  
8.

9.

Right of Stockholder. The Option Holder will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the Options until the date on which the Option Holder becomes a holder of record for the shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of full payment of the Option Exercise Price and applicable tax withholding.  
  
  
  
  
10.

Capital Adjustments and Reorganizations. The number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Option, and the Option Exercise Price thereof, shall be subject to such appropriate proportionate adjustment to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, share combination, separation, reorganization, liquidation or the like of or by the Company.  
  
  
  
  
11.

No Obligation to Retain. Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement confers on the Option Holder any right to continue in the employ of, or other relationship with, the Company or any subsidiary, or limits in any away the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the Option Holder’s employment or relationship at any time, with or without Cause.
