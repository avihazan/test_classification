NYFIX, INC.  
2001 STOCK OPTION PLAN  

  
Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (this “Agreement”), dated as of October 2,  
2007 (the “Date of Grant”), between NYFIX, Inc. (“NYFIX”) and Steven Vigliotti (the   
“Participant”).  
  
BACKGROUND  
  
Pursuant to the terms of the NYFIX, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”),   
NYFIX desires to (i) provide an incentive to the Participant, (ii) encourage the Participant to   
contribute materially to the growth of NYFIX and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”)   
and (iii) more closely align the Participant’s economic interests with those of NYFIX stockholders   
by means of a grant of Nonqualified Options. Whenever capitalized terms are used in this   
Agreement, they shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement or, if not defined in this   
Agreement, as set forth in the Plan.  
  
The Plan allows the Company to provide rewards and incentives to certain   
employees of the Company by, among other things, granting them opportunities to purchase shares  
of Stock. The Committee has determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and   
its stockholders to grant the Options to the Participant under the Plan.  
  
In consideration of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the   
Participant and NYFIX hereby agree as follows:  
  
ARTICLE I  
  
GRANT OF OPTIONS  
  
1.1 Grant of Options. The Participant is hereby granted Nonqualified Options  
representing the right to purchase 118,631 shares of Stock subject to the restrictions and conditions  
set forth in this Agreement. References in this Agreement to “Option” and “Options” mean the   
options granted hereby, individually and in the aggregate.  
  
1.2 Option Price. The purchase price of each share of Stock underlying the   
Options is $4.60 per share (the “Option Price”), which is the same as the Fair Market Value of  
a share of Stock on the Date of Grant.   
  
1.3 Grant Information. The Options have been granted under the Plan. The  
Committee authorized the grant of the Options on October 2, 2007.

each month over the next 36 months such that 100% of the Options are vested on March 10, 2011.

If a partial Option would vest on any date, the total number of Options vesting   
on such date shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Option.  
  
2.2 Accelerated and Continued Vesting. If not sooner vested and exercisable,   
and unless previously cancelled pursuant to Section 2.5 or 4.2,  
  
(i) all of the Options shall vest and become immediately exercisable   
upon a termination of the Participant’s employment (a) by the Company without Cause (as defined   
in Section 5.1) or (b) by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in Section 5.1), in either case   
within one year following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 5.1); and  
  
(ii) following a termination of the Participant’s employment (a) by the   
Company without Cause or (b) by the Participant for Good Reason, in either case prior to or more   
than one year following a Change in Control, the Participant’s Options that would have vested   
through the month that includes the last day of the period for which the Participant receives   
severance, if any, following such termination (the “Severance Period”), shall immediately vest.
