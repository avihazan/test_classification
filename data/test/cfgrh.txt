The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be and remain in effect during the period of three years beginning on the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, plus such extensions, if any, as are provided pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof (the “Employment Period”).

The Board of Directors of the Employer agrees to inform the Executive not less than thirty (30) days prior to any such anniversary date as to whether or not the Board of Directors elected to extend the term of this Agreement. If the Agreement is not extended as of any anniversary date, then this Agreement shall terminate at the conclusion of its remaining term. References herein to the term of this Agreement shall refer both to the initial term and successive terms. 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Corporation at any time from terminating the Executive’s employment as President and Chief Executive Officer during the Employment Period for any reason, provided that the relative rights and obligations of the Corporation and the Executive in the event of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement. 

(d) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall manage the operations of the Corporation and oversee the officers that report to him. The Executive shall also oversee the implementation of the policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and shall report directly to the Board of Directors. In addition, the Executive shall perform such executive services for the Corporation as may be consistent with his titles and from time to time assigned to him by the Corporation’s Board of Directors. 

3\. Compensation and Benefits.

(a) The Employer shall compensate and pay the Executive for his services during the term of this Agreement at a minimum base salary of $215,000 per year (“Base Salary”), which amount may be increased from time to time in such amounts as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Employer and may not be decreased without the Executive’s express written consent. In addition to his Base Salary, the Executive shall be entitled to receive during the term of this Agreement such bonus payments as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Employer.

The Corporation shall not make any changes in such plans, benefits or privileges which would adversely affect the Executive’s rights or benefits thereunder, unless such change occurs pursuant to a program applicable to all executive officers of the Corporation and does not result in a proportionately greater adverse change in the rights of or benefits to the Executive as compared with any other executive officer of the Corporation. 

4 

* * *

Nothing paid to the Executive under any plan or arrangement presently in effect or made available in the future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable to the Executive pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof. 

(c) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to paid annual vacation in accordance with the policy as established from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Employer. The Executive shall not be entitled to receive any additional compensation from the Employer for failure to take a vacation, nor shall the Executive be able to accumulate unused vacation time from one year to the next, except to the extent authorized by the Board of Directors of the Employer. 

(d) Except as otherwise agreed between the Corporation and the Bank, the Executive’s compensation, benefits and severance set forth in this Agreement shall be paid by the Corporation and the Bank in the same proportion as the time and services actually expended by the Executive on the business of the Corporation and the business of the Bank, respectively, with any amounts paid by the Bank to be credited towards the obligations of the Corporation under this Agreement. For this purpose, the Executive shall maintain, and provide to the Corporation on at least a monthly basis, documentation of the time and expenses expended by the Executive on the business of each of the Corporation and the Bank. No provision contained in this Agreement shall require the Bank to pay any portion of the Executive’s compensation, benefits, severance and expenses required to be paid by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement. 

4\. Expenses. The Employer shall reimburse the Executive or otherwise provide for or pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in furtherance of or in connection with the business of the Employer, including, but not by way of limitation, automobile expenses, traveling expenses, and all reasonable entertainment expenses (whether incurred at the Executive’s residence, while traveling or otherwise), subject to such reasonable documentation and policies as may be established by the Board of Directors of the Employer. If such expenses are paid in the first instance by the Executive, the Employer shall reimburse the Executive therefor. Such reimbursement shall be paid promptly by the Employer and in any event no later than March 15 of the year immediately following the year in which such expenses were incurred. 

5\. Termination.

(a) The Corporation shall have the right, at any time upon prior Notice of Termination, to terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder for any reason, including without limitation termination for Cause, Disability or Retirement, and the Executive shall have the right, upon prior Notice of Termination, to terminate his employment hereunder for any reason. 

(b) In the event that (i) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Corporation for Cause or (ii) the Executive terminates his employment hereunder other than for Disability, Retirement, death or Good Reason, the Executive shall have no right pursuant to this Agreement to compensation or other benefits for any period after the applicable Date of Termination. 

5 

* * *

(c) In the event that the Executive’s employment is terminated as a result of Disability, Retirement or the Executive’s death during the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall have no right pursuant to this Agreement to compensation or other benefits for any period after the applicable Date of Termination. 

(d) In the event that prior to a Change in Control (i) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Employer for other than Cause, Disability, Retirement or the Executive’s death or (ii) such employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Employer shall: 

(A) pay to the Executive, in a lump sum as of the Date of Termination, a cash severance amount equal to three (3) times that portion of his Base Salary paid by the Corporation, and 

(B) maintain and provide for a period ending at the earlier of (i) thirty-six (36) months after the Date of Termination or (ii) the date of the Executive’s full-time employment by another employer (provided that the Executive is entitled under the terms of such employment to benefits substantially similar to those described in this subparagraph (B)), at no cost to the Executive, the continued participation of the Executive and his dependents in all group insurance, life insurance, health and accident insurance, and disability insurance offered by the Employer in which the Executive and his dependents were participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 5(f) below. 

(e) In the event that either concurrently with or following a Change in Control (i) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Employer for other than Cause, Disability, Retirement or the Executive’s death or (ii) such employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Employer shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, if applicable, 

(A) pay to the Executive, in a lump sum as of the Date of Termination, a cash severance amount equal to three (3) times that portion of his Annual Compensation paid by the Corporation, and 

(B) maintain and provide for a period ending at the earlier of (i) thirty-six (36) months after the Date of Termination or (ii) the date of the Executive’s full-time employment by another employer (provided that the Executive is entitled under the terms of such employment to benefits substantially similar to those described in this subparagraph (B)), at no cost to the Executive, the continued participation of the Executive and his dependents in all group insurance, life insurance, health and accident insurance, and disability insurance offered by the Employer in which the Executive and his dependents were participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 5(f) below. 

(f) Any insurance premiums payable by the Employer or any successors pursuant to this Section 5 shall be payable at such times and in such amounts (except that the Employer shall also pay any employee portion of the premiums) as if the Executive was still an employee of the Employer, subject to any increases in such amounts imposed by the insurance company or 

6 

* * *

COBRA, and the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Employer in any taxable year shall not affect the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Employer in any other taxable year; provided, however, that if the Executive’s participation in any group insurance plan is barred, the Employer shall either arrange to provide the Executive with insurance benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive was entitled to receive under such group insurance plan or, if such coverage cannot be obtained, pay a lump sum cash equivalency amount within thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination based on the annualized rate of premiums being paid by the Employer as of the Date of Termination. 

6\. Payment of Additional Benefits under Certain Circumstances. 

(a) If (i) the payments and benefits pursuant to Section 5 hereof, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the Corporation or the Bank (including, without limitation, the payments and benefits which the Executive would have the right to receive from the Bank pursuant to either Section 5 of the Bank Agreement or Article 2 of the Salary Continuation Agreement between the Bank and the Executive (the “Bank SERP”), before giving effect to any reduction in such amounts pursuant to either Section 6 of the Bank Agreement or Section 2.4.3 of the Bank SERP), would constitute a “parachute payment” as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (the “Initial Parachute Payment”), and (ii) the Initial Parachute Payment either equals three times the Executive’s Base Amount or exceed three times the Executive’s Base Amount but by an amount less than 5% of three times the Executive’s Base Amount, then the Initial Parachute Payment shall be reduced by the least amount necessary to bring the present value of the payments and benefits below three times the Executive’s Base Amount, with the cash severance to be reduced first. As used in this Agreement, “Base Amount” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code. 

(b) If the Initial Parachute Payment exceeds 105% of three times the Executive’s Base Amount, then the Corporation shall pay to the Executive, in a lump sum within five business days after the Date of Termination, a lump sum cash amount equal to the sum of the following: 

(A) the amount by which the payments and benefits that would have otherwise been paid by the Bank to the Executive pursuant to Section 5 of the Bank Agreement are reduced by the provisions of Section 6 of the Bank Agreement; 

(B) the amount by which the payments that would otherwise have been paid by the Bank pursuant to Article 2 of the Bank SERP are reduced by the provisions of Section 2.4.3 of the Bank SERP; 

(C) twenty (20) percent (or such other percentage equal to the tax rate imposed by Section 4999 of the Code) of the amount by which the Initial Parachute Payment exceeds the Executive’s “base amount” from the Corporation and the Bank, as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code, with the difference between the Initial Parachute Payment and the Executive’s base amount being hereinafter referred to as the “Initial Excess Parachute Payment”; and 

7 

* * *

(D) such additional amount (tax allowance) as may be necessary to compensate the Executive for the payment by the Executive of state, local and federal income and excise taxes on the payment provided under clause (C) above and on any payments under this clause (D). In computing such tax allowance, the payment to be made under clause (C) above shall be multiplied by the “gross up percentage” (“GUP”). The GUP shall be determined as follows:   
  
GUP =

Tax Rate  
  
1-Tax Rate  
  
The Tax Rate for purposes of computing the GUP shall be the highest marginal federal, state and local income and employment-related tax rate (including Social Security and Medicare taxes), including any applicable excise tax rate, applicable to the Executive in the year in which the payment under clause (C) above is made, and shall also reflect the phase-out of deductions and the ability to deduct certain of such taxes. 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it shall subsequently be determined in a final judicial determination or a final administrative settlement to which the Executive is a party that the actual excess parachute payment as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code is different from the Initial Excess Parachute Payment (such different amount being hereafter referred to as the “Determinative Excess Parachute Payment”), then the Corporation’s independent tax counsel shall determine the amount (the “Adjustment Amount”) which either the Executive must pay to the Corporation or the Corporation must pay to the Executive in order to put the Executive (or the Corporation, as the case may be) in the same position the Executive (or the Corporation, as the case may be) would have been if the Initial Excess Parachute Payment had been equal to the Determinative Excess Parachute Payment. In determining the Adjustment Amount, the independent tax counsel shall take into account any and all taxes (including any penalties and interest) paid by or for the Executive or refunded to the Executive or for the Executive’s benefit. As soon as practicable after the Adjustment Amount has been so determined, and in no event more than thirty (30) days after the Adjustment Amount has been determined, the Corporation shall pay the Adjustment Amount to the Executive or the Executive shall repay the Adjustment Amount to the Corporation, as the case may be. 

(d) In each calendar year that the Executive receives payments of benefits that constitute a parachute amount, the Executive shall report on his state and federal income tax returns such information as is consistent with the determination made by the independent tax counsel of the Corporation as described above. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless from any and all losses, costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, interest, fines and penalties) which the Executive incurs as a result of so reporting such information, with such indemnification to be paid by the Corporation to the Executive as soon as practicable and in any event no later than March 15 of the year immediately following the year in which the amount subject to indemnification was determined. The Executive shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing whenever the Executive receives notice of the institution of a judicial or administrative proceeding, formal or informal, in which the federal tax treatment under Section 4999 of the Code of any amount paid or payable under this Section 6 is being reviewed or is in dispute. The Corporation shall assume control at its expense over all legal and accounting matters pertaining to such federal tax treatment (except to 

8 

* * *

the extent necessary or appropriate for the Executive to resolve any such proceeding with respect to any matter unrelated to amounts paid or payable pursuant to this Section 6) and the Executive shall cooperate fully with the Corporation in any such proceeding. The Executive shall not enter into any compromise or settlement or otherwise prejudice any rights the Corporation may have in connection therewith without the prior consent of the Corporation. 

7\. Mitigation; Exclusivity of Benefits. 

(a) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any benefits hereunder by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any such benefits be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as a result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise, except as set forth in Sections 5(d)(B) and 5(e)(B) above. 

(b) The specific arrangements referred to herein are not intended to exclude any other vested benefits which may be available to the Executive upon a termination of employment with the Corporation pursuant to employee benefit plans of the Bank or the Corporation or otherwise. 

8\. Withholding. All payments required to be made by the Corporation hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Corporation shall determine are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 

9\. Assignability. The Corporation may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder in whole, but not in part, to any corporation, bank or other entity with or into which the Corporation may hereafter merge or consolidate or to which the Corporation may transfer all or substantially all of its assets, if in any such case said corporation, bank or other entity shall by operation of law or expressly in writing assume all obligations of the Corporation hereunder as fully as if it had been originally made a party hereto, but may not otherwise assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder. The Executive may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder. 

10\. Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth below:

11\. Amendment; Waiver. No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and such officer or officers as may be specifically designated by the Corporation Board to sign on its behalf. No waiver by any party hereto at any time of any breach by any other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.

12\. Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States where applicable and otherwise by the substantive laws of the State of Louisiana. 

13\. Nature of Obligations. Nothing contained herein shall create or require the Corporation to create a trust of any kind to fund any benefits which may be payable hereunder, and to the extent that the Executive acquires a right to receive benefits from the Corporation hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. 

14\. Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

15\. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

16\. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

17\. Regulatory Prohibition. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any payments made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. §1828(k)) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359. 

18\. Changes in Statutes or Regulations. If any statutory or regulatory provision referenced herein is subsequently changed or re-numbered, or is replaced by a separate provision, then the references in this Agreement to such statutory or regulatory provision shall be deemed to be a reference to such section as amended, re-numbered or replaced. 

19\. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between the Corporation and the Executive with respect to the matters agreed to herein. All prior agreements between the Corporation and the Executive with respect to the matters agreed to herein are hereby superseded and shall have no force or effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect the agreement of even date being entered into between the Bank and the Executive.
