(ii)

Upon termination of employment for any reason, for the longer of (A) the period of time during which Executive is receiving any form of compensation from the Company (including compensation being paid pursuant to Section 7 above) or, (B) one (1) year from the termination of his employment, Executive will not, on behalf of himself, or any other person, firm or corporation, solicit any of the Company's customers, clients, landlords, owners, tenants, and business or joint venture partners with whom he has had contact while working for the Company; nor will Executive in any way, directly or indirectly, for himself, or any other person, firm, corporation or entity, divert, or take away any of the Company's customers, clients, landlords, owners, tenants, suppliers and business or joint venture partners with whom Executive has had contact. For purposes of this Section, the term "contact" shall mean engaging in any co mmunication, whether written or oral, with the customer, client, landlord, owner, tenant, supplier and business or joint venture partner or any representative thereof, or obtaining any information with respect to such customer, client, landlord, owner, tenant, supplier and business or joint venture partner or representative thereof that results in a loss of existing business for Kimco.

Executive acknowledges that this Section 10, its terms and his compliance are necessary to protect the Company's Confidential and Proprietary Information, its business and its goodwill, and that a breach of any of Executive's promises contained in this Section 10 will irreparably and continually damage the Company to an extent that money damages may not be adequate. For these reasons, Executive agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of this Section 10, the Company shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction restraining Executive from such breach, without the posting of a bond. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available for such breach or threatened breach or any other breach of this Agreement.
