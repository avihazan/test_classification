4.1.1 Directors and Officers. Each person who was or is party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (“Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the written request of the Corporation’s board of directors or its designee as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by law, including but not limited to the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said Law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) (“Delaware General Corporation Law”), against all expenses liability and loss (including attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation.

4.1.2 Employees. At the sole discretion of the Corporation, any employee or agent who is not an officer or director of the Corporation or a subsidiary, who was, is, or is threatened to be made party to a Proceeding, may be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware General Corporation Law against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation. 

4.2. Advance of Expenses. Expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation, or by an employee indemnified at the discretion of the Corporation pursuant to Section 4.1.2 of this Article IV, in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding subject to the provisions of any applicable statute; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, in which such director or officer agrees to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be ultimately determined by a court or other tribunal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. 

4.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 4.1.1 of this Article IV is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. In any such action, the burden of proof shall be on the Corporation to prove the claimant is not entitled to such payment. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that the claimant is entitled to indemnification or advancement under the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors or independent legal counsel) that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification or advancement, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification and advancement. The expenses of a claimant in prosecuting a successful claim for indemnification, and the fees and expenses of any special legal counsel engaged to determine permissibility of indemnification or advance of expenses, shall be borne by the Corporation. 

4.4. Contractual Rights; Applicability. The right to be indemnified or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses pursuant hereto (i) is a contract right based upon good and valuable consideration, pursuant to which the person entitled thereto may bring suit as if the provisions hereof where set forth in a separate written contract between the Corporation and such person, (ii) is intended to be retroactive and shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption hereof, and (iii) shall continue to exist after the rescission or restrictive modification hereof with respect to events occurring prior thereto. 

4.5 Requested Service. Any director or officer of the Corporation serving in any capacity, and any other person serving as director or officer of, (i) another organization of which

a majority of the outstanding voting securities representing the present right to vote for the election of its directors or equivalent executives is owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation, or (ii) any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any organization referred to in clause (i), shall be deemed to be doing so at the written request of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. 

4.6. Indemnification Not Exclusive; Inuring of Benefit. The rights conferred on any person by this Article IV shall not be deemed exclusive of and shall be in addition to any other right to which such person may be entitled under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any such person. 

4.7. Insurance and Other Indemnification. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
