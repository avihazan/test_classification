# 7\. Gross Up Rights.

# 

## 7.1 If at any time after Closing and until the earlier of (a) the first date upon which Buyer no longer beneficially owns Seller Common Stock representing at least 4.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock immediately prior to an issuance contemplated under this Section 7.1, or (b) the date of any breach by Buyer of any obligation under this Agreement, Seller issues or proposes to issue any Seller Common Stock or any or securities convertible into shares of Seller Common Stock, Buyer shall have the option and right to acquire such number of shares of Seller Common Stock so that immediately after such issuance Buyer shall beneficially own the same percentage of such Seller Common Stock on an as converted basis as was beneficially owned by Buyer before such issuance.

## 

## 7.2 Prior to issuing any Seller Common Stock or any securities convertible into shares of Seller Common Stock (other than issuances pursuant to Section 7.3), Seller shall provide Buyer with ten business days’ prior written notice (or if such notice period is not possible under the circumstances, such prior notice as is practicable) of the proposed issuance. Buyer shall have the right, exercisable by providing written notice to Seller of the exercise of its rights within ten days after receipt of Seller’s notice, to purchase for cash directly from Seller up to a sufficient number of such Seller Common Stock so that, after giving effect to such issuance, Buyer will beneficially own the same percentage of such Seller Common Stock on an as converted basis as was beneficially owned by Buyer before such issuance. The purchase price for any Seller Common Stock purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.2 will be the price at which Seller issues such Seller Common Stock or any securities convertible into shares of Seller Common Stock to other shareholders or third parties. Seller shall provide such information, to the extent reasonably available, relating to any non-cash consideration as Buyer may reasonably request in order to

* * *

  


## evaluate any non-cash consideration paid in respect of any issuance pursuant to this Section 7.2. If, in connection with any issuance by Seller covered by this Section 7.2, Buyer gives notice of its intent to exercise its option under this Section 7.2 but has not purchased the securities subject thereto within 60 days thereafter for reasons not primarily related to actions or omissions of Seller or the absence of any approvals or consents or the taking of any other actions required to be taken under applicable law or the prohibition on purchasing such securities during such period imposed by applicable securities laws, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights to purchase such securities under this Section 7 with respect to such issuance of Seller Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of Seller Common Stock.

## 

## 7.3 The provisions in this Section 7 shall not apply to any issuance of capital stock of Seller or other equity interests of Seller or securities convertible into shares of capital stock or other equity interests in Seller or any of its subsidiaries (A) to employees, officers or directors of Seller or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to management or employee incentive programs or plans approved by the Board of Directors (including any such programs or plans in existence on the date hereof), (B) by Seller or any of its subsidiaries to a third party as consideration in connection with (but not in connection with raising capital to fund) (x) an acquisition or strategic business combination approved by the Board of Directors, or (y) an investment by Seller or its subsidiaries approved by the Board of Directors in any party which is not prior to such transaction an affiliate of Seller (whether by merger, consolidation, stock swap, sale of assets or securities, or otherwise), (C) by Seller or its subsidiaries in any registered public offering, (D) upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants or other convertible securities, and (E) in connection with any stock split, stock dividend paid on a proportionate basis to all holders of the affected class of capital stock or recapitalization approved by the Board of Directors.
