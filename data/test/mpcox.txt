Name of Awardee: ____________________

Number of Restricted Stock Units: __________

Performance Period: See Attached Schedule 

Performance Metric: See Attached Schedule

  


Pursuant to the Citrix Systems, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the “Plan”), Citrix Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) hereby grants an Award (as defined in the Plan) of Restricted Stock Units (as defined in the Plan) to the awardee named above (the “Awardee”). Upon acceptance of this Agreement (the “Award Agreement”), Awardee shall receive the number of Restricted Stock Units specified above, subject to the restrictions and conditions set forth in this Award Agreement and in the Plan.

  


1.Vesting.

(a)This Award may not be settled until the Committee has determined that the Award has vested. Except as otherwise provided herein, vesting shall be based on the Company’s performance during the Performance Period identified above and, except as provided in Section 2(b), shall be further subject to the Awardee’s continuous employment with the Company or its Affiliates through the conclusion of the Performance Period. Solely for purposes of the continuous employment requirement set forth in this Section 1 and Section 4, if the business of the Company as to which the Awardee’s employment then relates is sold or spun-off prior to the conclusion of the Performance Period, continued employment of the awardee with the successor entity or one of its affiliates shall be considered employment with the Company.

(b)The Committee, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 60 days) following the conclusion of the Performance Period, shall determine whether this Award has vested upon the final day of the Performance Period (the “Vesting Date”) in accordance with Section 2; and on the Vesting Date, 100% of such actual number of Restricted Stock Units shall vest in one installment. The Awardee shall forfeit this Award if it is not vested upon the conclusion of the Performance Period.

2.Performance Criteria and Attainment Levels.

(a)During the first 60 days following the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the number of Restricted Stock Units underlying this Award that shall become vested based on the level of achievement of each performance metric set forth in the attached Schedule. Any Restricted Stock Units that do not become vested shall be forfeited immediately and be null and void. 

(b)Upon an Acquisition (as defined in the Plan) that occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Awardee shall earn, and shall immediately vest in a portion of the Award determined by multiplying the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the full and partial months from the Award Date to the effective date of the Acquisition and the denominator of which shall be the number of months in the Performance Period.

3.Issuance of Stock.

(a) Subject to the determination of the attainment level by the Committee or pursuant to Section 2(b) each vested Restricted Stock Unit entitles Awardee to receive one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Stock”). 

(b) Within a reasonable amount of time after the Committee has made the determination pursuant to Section 2 or pursuant to Section 2(b) (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the year in which the Vesting Date or the Acquisition occurs, as applicable), Awardee’s name shall be entered as the stockholder of record on the books and records of the Company with respect to the shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units earned in accordance with this Agreement and upon compliance to the satisfaction of the Committee with all requirements under applicable laws or regulations in connection with such issuance and with the requirements hereof and of the Plan. The determination of the Committee as to such compliance shall be final and binding on Awardee.

(c) Until such time as shares of Stock have been issued to Awardee pursuant to Section 3(b) above, Awardee shall not have any rights as a holder of the shares of Stock underlying this Award, including but not limited to voting rights.

(d) If on any date the Company shall pay any cash dividend on shares of Stock, the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to Awardee shall, as of such date, be increased by an amount (rounded to the nearest whole number) determined by the following formula:

W = (X multiplied by Y) divided by Z, where:

W = the number of additional Restricted Stock Units to be credited to Awardee on such dividend payment date;

X = the aggregate number of Restricted Stock Units (whether vested or unvested) credited to Awardee as of the record date of the dividend;

Y = the cash dividend per share amount; and 

Z = the Fair Market Value per share of Stock (as determined under the Plan) on the dividend payment date.

In the case of a dividend paid on Stock in the form of Stock, including without limitation a distribution of Stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split or otherwise, the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to Awardee shall be increased by a number equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of Restricted Stock Units that have been awarded to Awardee through the related dividend record date, and (ii) the number of shares of Stock (including any fraction thereof) payable as dividend on one share of Stock. In the case of a dividend payable in property other than shares of Stock or cash, the value of such dividend per share of Stock shall be determined in good faith by the Board and shall be converted to additional Restricted Stock Units based on the formula above. Any additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the vesting and restrictions of this Award Agreement in the same manner and for so long as the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Award Agreement to which they relate remain subject to such vesting and restrictions, and shall be promptly forfeited to the Company if and when such Restricted Stock Units are so forfeited.

4.Termination of Employment.

(a)If Awardee’s employment by the Company or its Affiliates (as defined in the Plan) is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated (regardless of whether Awardee continues to be an employee under local labor laws) for any reason other than Disability, death or Retirement prior to the end of the Performance Period, Awardee’s rights in any Restricted Stock Units that are not vested shall automatically terminate as of the date Awardee is no longer actively employed by the Company and its Affiliates as determined by the Committee or any of its delegates in its, his or her sole discretion (the “Termination Date”), and such Restricted Stock Units shall be canceled and shall be of no further force and effect.

(b)If Awardee’s termination of employment is on account of Disability, death or Retirement prior to the end of the Performance Period, Awardee shall not forfeit his Award and shall remain eligible to earn his Award, subject to the requirements of Section 2; provided, however, that the number of Restricted Stock Units determined pursuant to Section 2 by the Committee shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the full and partial months from the Award Date to Awardee’s date of termination of employment and the denominator of which shall be the number of months in the Performance Period. For purposes hereof, “Disability” means Awardee’s termination of employment from the Company or its Affiliates after becoming eligible to receive benefits under the Company’s or an Affiliate’s then current long-term disability plan applicable to such Awardee, and “Retirement” means Awardee’s termination of employment from the Company or its Affiliates after attainment of the age of 65 and provided that the Awardee has at such time completed at least four years of service with the Company or its Affiliates.

(c)In the event of Awardee’s termination of employment after the Performance Period, the Company, as soon as practicable following the Termination Date (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the end of the Performance Period) shall issue shares of Stock to Awardee (or Awardee’s designated beneficiary or estate executor, as applicable, in the event of Awardee’s death) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, as of the Termination Date, have been earned but for which shares of Stock had not yet been issued to Awardee. 

5.Incorporation of Plan. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Award shall be subject to and governed by all the terms and conditions of the Plan. Capitalized terms in this Award Agreement shall have the meaning specified in the Plan, unless a different meaning is specified herein.

6.Transferability. This Award Agreement and the Award are personal to Awardee, non-assignable and not transferable in any manner, by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. If Awardee is a U.S. employee (as determined by the Committee or any of its delegatees in its, his sole discretion), Awardee may be permitted to designate a beneficiary with respect to the shares of Stock to be issued upon vesting of the Award.

7.Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Company, or if different, Awardee’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Awardee’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Awardee (“Tax-Related Items”), Awardee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains his responsibility and that such liability may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Awardee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Stock upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Stock and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Awardee’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Awardee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of 

  


  


* * *

  


  


any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Awardee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Awardee’s Tax-Related Items subject to a withholding obligation by the Company and/or the Employer shall be satisfied through a net issuance of shares. The Company shall withhold from shares of Stock to be issued to Awardee a number of shares of Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value that would satisfy the Tax-Related Items due. Alternatively, or in addition, the Company or the Employer may decide in their sole and absolute discretion to satisfy Awardee’s obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Stock acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Awardee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (ii) in any other way set forth in Section 15 of the Plan.

To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case Awardee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Stock, for tax purposes, Awardee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of shares is held back solely for purposes of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of Awardee’s participation in the Plan.

Finally, Awardee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Awardee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Stock or the proceeds of the sale of Stock, if Awardee fails to comply with Awardee’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

8.No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Awardee’s participation in the Plan, or Awardee’s acquisition or sale of the underlying Stock. Awardee is hereby advised to consult with his own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

9.Data Privacy. By entering into this Award Agreement, Awardee explicitly, voluntarily and unambiguously consents to the collection, use, and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Awardee’s personal data as described in this Award Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Awardee’s participation in the Plan.

Awardee understands that the Employer, the Company and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about Awardee, including, but not limited to, Awardee’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, or any shares held in the Company, and details of all Awards or other entitlement to shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested, or outstanding in Awardee’s favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of managing and administering the Plan.

Awardee further understands that the Employer, the Company and/or its Affiliates will transfer Data among themselves as necessary for the exclusive purposes of implementation, administration and management of Awardee’s participation in the Plan, and that the Employer, the Company and/or its 

  


  


* * *

  


  


Affiliates may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan, including Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company (“Data Recipients”).

Awardee understands that the Data Recipients may be located in Awardee’s country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the Data Recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections. Awardee understands that, if Awardee resides outside the United States, Awardee may request a list with the names and addresses of Data Recipients by contacting in writing Awardee’s local human resources representative. Awardee authorizes the Data Recipients to receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering, and managing Awardee’s participation in the Plan. Awardee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Awardee’s participation in the Plan. 

Awardee understands that, if Awardee resides outside the United States, Awardee may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data to make the information contained therein factually accurate, or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Awardee’s local human resources representative. 

Further, Awardee understands that Awardee is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If Awardee does not consent, or if Awardee later seeks to revoke the consents, Awardee’s employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing the consents is that the Company would not be able to grant Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards to Awardee or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, Awardee understands that refusing or withdrawing the consents may affect Awardee’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Awardee’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Awardee understands that Awardee may contact in writing Awardee’s local human resources representative.
