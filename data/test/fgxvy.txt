3

* * *

act(s) on which such termination is premised, and if such act(s) is susceptible of cure or remedy, Executive shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to cure any deficiencies; or

(e)

Executive’s material violation of the material written rules, regulations, procedures, or policies relating to the conduct of employees, directors or officers of the Company.

(d)

The failure of a successor to the assets or business of the Company to assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.  
  
It shall be a condition precedent to Executive’s right to terminate his employment for Good Reason that (a) he shall have first given the Company written notice stating with reasonable specificity the act(s) on which such termination is premised within forty-five (45) days after Executive becomes aware of such act(s), (b) if such act(s) is susceptible of cure or remedy, it has not been cured or remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (c) Executive has terminated his employment within forty-five (45) days after so notifying the Company.

4.1.4 Any Other Reason. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, QTS LLC shall have the right to terminate Executive’s employment under this Agreement at any time without Cause by giving written notice of such termination to Executive, and Executive shall have the right to terminate Executive’s employment under this Agreement at any time without Good Reason by giving written notice of such termination to QTS LLC. Any notice by Executive hereunder shall be given at least sixty (60) days in advance of such termination.  
  
4.2 Termination Date. Except as provided in Section 4.1.1 with respect to Executive’s death or Disability, any termination under Section 4.1 shall be effective upon receipt of notice by Executive or QTS LLC, as the case may be, of such termination or upon such other later date as may be provided herein or specified by QTS LLC or Executive in the notice (the “Termination Date”).

(c)

QTS LLC shall pay to Executive, in a lump sum in cash on the first payroll date following sixty (60) days after the Termination Date all bonus amounts earned but not yet paid for the year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs;

If not previously vested in full, the Equity Awards and any other equity awards granted to Executive that otherwise would vest during the then-current term of this Agreement (whether the initial term or any renewal term) shall fully vest as of the Termination Date;  
  
(e)

(f)

QTS LLC shall provide to Executive, at QTS LLC’s expense, outplacement services and support, the scope and provider of which will be selected by Executive, for a period of one (1) year follow the Termination Date.  
  
QTS LLC’s delivery of any notice under Section 1.2 of this Agreement that the Agreement will not be renewed and any subsequent termination of Executive’s employment at the expiration of such

5

* * *

Term of the Agreement shall not be considered a termination without Cause except in the case of non-renewal after the initial two-year Term, and Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits under this Section 4.3.2 under such circumstance.

4.3.3 Termination Due to Death or Disability. In the event that Executive’s employment is terminated due to Executive’s death or Disability QTS LLC shall pay all Accrued Obligations to Executive or Executive’s estate in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) business days after the Termination Date. In addition, if not previously vested in full, the Equity Awards and any other equity awards granted to Executive shall fully vest as of the Termination Date.  
  
4.3.4 Waiver and Release Agreement. In consideration of the severance payments and other benefits described in clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 4.3.2, to which severance payments and benefits Executive would not otherwise be entitled, and as a precondition to Executive becoming entitled to such severance payments and other benefits under this Agreement, Executive agrees to execute and deliver to QTS LLC on or before the sixtieth (60th) day after the applicable Termination Date a waiver and general release of claims in favor of the Company, the General Partner (and any successor general partner of the Company) and QTS LLC, their respective predecessors and successors, and all of the respective current or former directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, members, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing, in a form reasonably satisfactory to QTS LLC, that has become effective in accordance with its terms, and for which any revocation periods applicable to such release shall have expired on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day following Executive’s Termination Date. If Executive fails to execute and deliver such release agreement on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following the applicable Termination Date, if any revocation period applicable to such release has not expired on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following Executive’s Termination Date or if Executive revokes such release as provided therein, QTS LLC shall have no obligation to provide any of the severance payments and other benefits described in clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 4.3.2, other than any Accrued Obligations.  
  
4.4 Required Delay For Certain Deferred Compensation and Section 409A. In the event that any compensation with respect to Executive’s termination is “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 409A”), and Executive is determined to be a “specified employee,” as defined in Section 409A (a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, payment of such compensation shall be delayed as required by Section 409A. Such delay shall last six (6) months from the date of Executive’s termination, except in the event of Executive’s death. Within twenty (20) business days following the end of such six (6)-month period, or, if earlier, Executive’s death, QTS LLC shall make a catch-up payment to Executive equal to the total amount of such payments that would have been made during the six (6)-month period but for this Section 4.4. Such catch-up payment shall bear simple interest at the prime rate of interest as published by the Wall Street Journal’s bank survey as of the first day of the six (6)-month period, which such interest shall be paid with the catch-up payment. Wherever payments under this Agreement are to be made in installments, each such installment shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. The Executive will be deemed to have a Termination Date for purposes of determining the timing of any payments or benefits hereunder that are classified as deferred compensation only upon a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. Any amount that the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed  
  
6

* * *

under this Agreement will be reimbursed to the Executive as promptly as practical and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the expenses are incurred and any right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of QTS LLC.

4.5 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive’s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by QTS LLC, the Company or its subsidiaries and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other contract or agreement with QTS LLC, the Company or its subsidiaries at or subsequent to the Termination Date, which shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
