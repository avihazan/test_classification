His office will be in New York City.

  


3\. Other Activities.

4\. Compensation. As basic compensation (“Basic Compensation”) for all of his services to the Company and its subsidiaries hereunder, the Company will pay or cause to be paid to the Executive, during the term of his employment, a salary at the rate of Nine Hundred Seven Five Thousand ($975,000) Dollars per annum, payable in accordance with the Company’s customary payroll practices, as in effect from time to time, and shall be subject to such increases as the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion may from time to time determine.

7\. Benefits.

This obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the employment of the Executive by the Company and its breach or threatened breach may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.
