3.Expenditure Commitments and Shortfall Payments. Each Expenditure for both the 60% Option and the 15% Option calls for RISE to contribute, at a minimum, the amount indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 in respect of the Property on or before the relevant completion date. If RISE fails to satisfy an Expenditure on or before such date, RISE may, in its sole discretion, pay to EASTFIELD the corresponding shortfall amount (being the difference between the relevant Expenditure and the Qualifying Expenses at that time) within 20 business days of the relevant completion date. Any Qualifying Expenses incurred in excess of Expenditure in both the 60% Option and the 15% Option will be  
  
rolled over and applied towards satisfying the next or succeeding Expenditure requirements.  
  
4.Option Period, Withdrawal and Termination. The “Option Period” shall commence on April 28, 2015 and end on the earlier of the date RISE exercises the 15% Option or the date this Agreement is terminated. This Agreement may be terminated as follows:  
  
a.by EASTFIELD sending a notice to RISE if RISE fails to make a cash payment or satisfy an Expenditure on the relevant completion date, and such cash payment or Expenditure remains outstanding for a period of 10 calendar days;  
  
b.by RISE sending a notice to EASTFIELD that it has elected to terminate this Agreement upon 10 business days’ notice.  
  
5.Exercise of Option. Within 10 business days of exercising the 60% Option or 15% Option, as applicable, EASTFIELD shall deliver to RISE all registerable instruments of transfer executed by EASTFIELD as transferor of the corresponding percentage interest in the Property in favour of RISE as transferee, together with anything reasonably required by RISE to give full effect to the transfer of the interest.  
  
6.Exploration Report. On at least an annual basis, RISE will provide to EASTFIELD a report summarising the results of its Exploration on the Property and access to all new information regarding the Property developed or obtained by RISE during the period covered by such report.  
  
7.Access Rights. During the Option Period, RISE and its Personnel shall have the exclusive licence to enter the Property and conduct operations thereon and RISE may exercise any and all of EASTFIELD’s rights as the legal and beneficial owner of the Property. RISE has complete discretion as to the nature, timing, method and conduct of all operations. RISE may access all business and confidential information in EASTFIELD’s possession, custody and control, which relate to the Property. RISE may, at its cost, sample any of EASTFIELD’s existing core samples and corresponding pulp samples for assay purposes.  
  
8.Marketing Rights. Subject to this clause 8, during the Option Period EASTFIELD and any person interested in acquiring all or a portion of EASTFIELD’s remaining interest in the Property (an “Interested Party”) may enter the Property and access all of EASTFIELD’s existing data on the Property and any new information which RISE has provided to EASTFIELD regarding the Property. Prior to receiving any information and entering the Property, any Interested Party shall execute a confidentiality agreement with EASTFIELD in form and substance acceptable to RISE, acting reasonably. Among other things, this agreement will require the Interested Party to:  
  
a.keep confidential all information disclosed to it by EASTFIELD and which it developed in connection with evaluating EASTFIELD’s interest in the Property;  
  
b.only use such information for the limited purpose of evaluating the desirability of acquiring EASTFIELD’s interest in the Property;  
  
c.not acquire any interest in any exploration or mining property or claim within two (2) kilometres of the Property for a period of 24 months; and  
  
d.provide RISE a copy of any report or reports generated from the Interested Party’s review of the Property or any data or information obtained from EASTFIELD.  
  
For greater clarity, EASTFIELD’s interest in the Property for the purposes of this clause 8 does not include that percentage of the Property subject to a valid Option in favour of RISE.

9.Exploration Rights. During the Option Period, RISE will, in exercising its rights to the extent that they relate to its operations on the Property:  
  
a.comply with the Mines Act (British Columbia), the Mineral Tenure Act (British Columbia), and any other laws dealing with miners and the Exploration for and mining of minerals;  
  
b.keep the Property in good standing; and  
  
c.use all reasonable endeavours to have its Exploration operations recorded for assessment credit against the Property to the fullest possible extent.  
  
10.Joint Venture Agreement. Upon the exercise the 60% Option, the Parties and IMPERIAL shall execute a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) on industry acceptable terms including, but not limited to, the following, and use the services of a recognized arbitrator of the Province of British Columbia in connection therewith if necessary. At this point in time, RISE will own a 60% interest in the Property while EASTFIELD and IMPERIAL combined will own the remaining 40% interest. Following the execution of the JVA and provided that RISE has yet to exercise the 15% Option, the interest of each party will be adjusted from time to time by the contribution of a party divided by the total contributions of all parties with the initial contribution of RISE being deemed to be $2,000,000 and that of EASTFIELD and IMPERIAL combined being deemed to be $1,333,333. The foregoing adjustment mechanism shall specifically exclude any payment made by RISE to EASTFIELD in connection with the exercise of the 15% Option. The JVA shall be governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia.  
  
11.Joint Venture Company. Upon the exercise of the 15% Option, the Parties and IMPERIAL shall form a joint venture company (“JVC”) that will own and operate the Property. Provided that the interest of the parties has not been adjusted in accordance with clause 10, the JVC will initially be 75% owned by RISE with EASTFIELD and IMPERIAL combined owning the remaining 25%. After the formation of the JVC, each party will contribute to its share to fund operations on the Property commensurate to such party’s interest in the Property. If one party does not contribute its interest in the Property will be reduced pro-rata.  
  
12.Management.  
  
a.For the duration of the Option Period, the Parties will form a management  
  
committee (the “Management Committee”) consisting of one representative from RISE, who shall act as Chairman, and one representative from EASTFIELD. The Management Committee shall be responsible for making any and all exploration and development decisions regarding the Property, including approving all work programs and budgets. During the Option Period, all decisions of the Management Committee shall be determined by a simple majority vote (through a show of hands) and if there is an equality of votes on a matter before the Management Committee, the Chairman shall have a further and deciding vote. Following the execution of the JVA, the Management Committee will continue to exist with all decisions being determined by a simple majority vote but with each representative having the number of votes commensurate with the interest of the relevant party in the Property at such time. The Management Committee will cease to exist once the JVC is formed.  
  
b.If at any time during the Option Period, RISE requires the assistance of third party contractors in conducting any Exploration, RISE agrees to consider using persons associated with EASTFIELD for such work provided RISE is satisfied that:  
  
i.such persons have demonstrable competence in the areas of work which RISE requires to be performed; and  
  
ii.the terms on which the work will be provided (including the costs or rates proposed to be charged) by such persons (i) are no less favourable than those which RISE could otherwise obtain from a similarly qualified and experienced contractor; and (ii) otherwise reflect prevailing market terms and rates.  
  
c.RISE may terminate its role as the operator on the Property upon providing EASTFIELD with 20 business days’ written notice.  
  
d.RISE may not exceed any work program and budget approved by the Management Committee by more than 10% except with the Management Committee’s prior approval or in a defensible emergency.  
  
e.During the Option Period, each Party will indemnify and hold harmless the other Party and its Personnel from and against all Claims and Liabilities incurred in connection with or in relation to its role as operator on the Property, save and except for those Claims and Liabilities which arise as a result of the Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct of a Party or its Personnel.  
  
13.Liability. Each Party agrees that neither shall be, in any circumstances, liable to the other Party for any indirect or consequential loss (including loss of profits, revenues, business opportunity and the like), howsoever arising; and releases the other from all Claims for indirect or consequential loss arising under, or in respect of, this Agreement.
