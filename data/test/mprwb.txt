SHAREHOLDERS 

Section 1.01 Place of Meetings. Each meeting of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer; provided, however, that any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the Corporation is located. 

Section 1.02 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the shareholders may be held on an annual or other less frequent basis as determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if a regular meeting has not been held during the immediately preceding fifteen (15) months, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent (3%) or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written demand given to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation. At each regular meeting the shareholders shall elect qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are due to expire within six (6) months after the date of the meeting and may transact any other business as may properly come before them, provided, however, that no business with respect to which special notice is required by law shall be transacted unless such notice shall have been given. 

Section 1.03 Special Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time by the Chief Executive Officer; by the Chief Financial Officer; by the Board of Directors or any two (2) or more members thereof; or by one (1) or more shareholders holding not less than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, who shall demand such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation specifying the purposes of such meeting except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that purpose, must be called by twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote. 

Section 1.04 Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer from any shareholder or shareholders entitled to call a meeting of the shareholders, it shall be the duty of the 

* * *

Board of Directors of the Corporation to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case may be, to be duly called and held on notice no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of such demand. If the Board of Directors fails to cause such a meeting to be called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as provided in Section 1.06 hereof at the expense of the Corporation. 

Section 1.05 Adjournments. Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned from time to time to another date, time and place. If any meeting of the shareholders is so adjourned, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given if the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment, and the adjourned meeting is held not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which may have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 

Section 1.06 Notice of Meetings. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of the shareholders, stating the date, time and place and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes, shall be given at least ten (10) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting except as specified in Section 1.05 or as otherwise permitted by law. The business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting. 

Section 1.07 Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place and purpose or purposes of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting. 

Section 1.08 Voting Rights. A shareholder shall have one (1) vote for each share held which is entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law, a holder of shares entitled to vote may vote any portion of the shares in any way the shareholder chooses. If a shareholder votes without designating the proportion or number of shares voted in a particular way, the shareholder is deemed to have voted all of the shares in that way. The Board of Directors may fix a date not more than sixty (60) days before the date of a meeting of shareholders as the record date for the determination of the holders of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a record date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of shareholders notwithstanding any transfer of shares on the books of the Corporation after any record date so fixed. If the Board of Directors fails to fix a record date for determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at, any meeting of shareholders, the record date shall be the twentieth (20th) day preceding the date of such meeting. 

Section 1.09 Proxies. A shareholder may cast, or authorize the casting of, a vote by filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the Corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effect. The shareholder may sign or authorize 

2 

* * *

the written appointment by telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission setting forth or submitted with information sufficient to determine that the shareholder authorized such transmission. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original. 

Section 1.10 Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders meeting are a quorum for the transaction of business at a regular or special meeting. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

Section 1.11 Acts of Shareholders. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (a) a majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (b) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a duly held meeting of shareholders. A shareholder voting by proxy authorized to vote on less than all items of business considered at the meeting shall be considered to be present and entitled to vote only with respect to those items of business for which the proxy has authority to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a shareholder who abstains with respect to an item of business shall be considered to have authority to vote on that item of business. 

Section 1.12 Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action. The written action is effective when it has been signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of those shareholders, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. 

ARTICLE II

Section 2.01 Number; Qualifications. Except as authorized by the shareholders pursuant to a shareholder control agreement or unanimous affirmative vote, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors of one or more directors.

majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum. Vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors serving at the time such directorships are created. Each person elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until a qualified successor is elected by the shareholders at the next regular meeting or at any special meeting duly called for that purpose. 

Section 2.04 Place of Meetings. Each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated from time to time by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or by the Chief Executive Officer.

The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting. 

Section 2.07 Waiver of Notice; Previously Scheduled Meetings. A director of the Corporation may waive notice of the date, time and place of a meeting of the Board of Directors. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and thereafter does not participate in the meeting. If the day or date, time and place of a Board of Directors meeting have been provided herein or announced at a previous meeting of the Board of Directors, no notice is required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened. 

Section 2.08 Quorum. The presence in person of a majority of the directors currently holding office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn a meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of directors originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

Section 2.09 Acts of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall take action by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting.

A director so participating shall be deemed present in person at the meeting. 

Section 2.11 Absent Directors. A director of the Corporation may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a Board of Directors meeting. If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as a vote in favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the director has consented or objected. 

Section 2.12 Action Without a Meeting. An action, other than an action requiring shareholder approval may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the number of directors that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which all directors were present. An action requiring shareholder approval may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the directors. The written action is effective when signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the required number of directors, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. When the written action is permitted to be taken by less than all directors, all directors shall be notified immediately of its text and effective date.

A committee shall consist of one or more natural persons, who need not be directors, appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly held Board of Directors meeting. Sections 2.04, 2.06 and 2.12 hereof shall apply to committees and members of committees to the same extent as those sections apply to the Board of Directors.
