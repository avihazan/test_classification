BACKGROUND

  


The Company wishes to secure the services of the Executive as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the Executive wishes to render such services to the Company upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. 

AGREEMENT

  


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. Employment by the Company. The Company agrees to employ the Executive in the position of Chief Operating Officer and the Executive accepts such employment and agrees to perform the duties that may be assigned to him as well as other duties that are customarily performed of a Chief Operating Officer of a company like the Company. The Executive agrees to devote his full business time and energies to the business of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and to faithfully, diligently and competently perform his duties hereunder.

  


2. Term of Employment. The term of this Employment Agreement (the "Term") shall be for the initial period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the first anniversary of the date thereof (provided that the provisions of Section 6 hereof shall survive any such termination), unless the Executive is earlier terminated as provided in Section 4 hereof. The Term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for additional one year periods following the expiration of the initial Term unless either party notifies the other party in writing that it does not want to renew this Agreement within 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial Term or any renewal Term.

  


3. Compensation. As full compensation for all services to be rendered by the Executive to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates in all capacities during the Term, the Executive shall receive the following compensation and benefits:

  


3.1 Salary. An annual base salary of $200,000 (the "Base Salary") payable not less frequently than monthly or at more frequent intervals in accordance with the then customary payroll practices of the Company. The board of directors of the Company shall review the Executive’s performance on an annual basis and shall suggest increases (but not decreases) to the Executive’s Base Salary as the board of directors of the Company deems appropriate. The Company acknowledges that the Executive has been providing services to the Company as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company since April 3, 2006. For the period from April 3, 2006 through May 1, 2006, the Executive shall be paid a pro rata amount of 75% of the equivalent of the Base Salary for that period in consideration of the services already provided.

3.2 Equity Participation. 

  


(a) The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within 5 business days) issue to the Executive 75,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Executive shall not directly or indirectly sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of 37,500 of such shares for a period of one year and the remaining 37,500 shares for a period of two years, except for sales, transfers or other dispositions made to family members, for estate planning purposes, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; provided that the transferee in such instance agrees in writing to be similarly bound to such transfer restriction. For the avoidance of doubt, all 75,000 shares are immediately earned upon issuance and not subject to any vesting or repurchase right in favor of the Company or any other person. The shares will bear a customary restrictive legend that refers to the aforementioned transfer restriction and applicable transfer restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933 and the stop transfer orders shall be imposed against the shares.

(b) The Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Company's 2006 Stock Plan (the "Plan"). The Executive shall, upon execution of this Agreement, be granted options to acquire 525,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company pursuant to the Plan. Such options shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with the provisions of a separate Stock Option Agreement which shall be entered into between the Executive and the Company on or about the date hereof and which shall provide (a) that the options are intended to be incentive stock options, (b) an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant, (c) for vesting in equal monthly installments over a three year period beginning on the six month anniversary of the date of grant (provided that 6/48 of the option will vest on such six month anniversary) with accelerated vesting upon (i) a Change of Control (as defined below), (ii) termination of the Executive by the Company without Cause (as defined below), or (iii) the cessation of the Executive’s employment with the Company for Good Reason (as defined below), and (d) for a ten year term. 

  


3.3 Bonus. In addition to the Base Salary, the Executive shall be entitled to an annual incentive bonus to be determined in each instance by the board of directors of the Company. In making its determination of what percentage of Base Salary the Executive will be entitled to as a bonus, the board of directors of the Company will consider the Company’s progress with regard to achievement of the following milestones: government grants and appropriations, partnering and teaming arrangements with Western nuclear power companies (particularly, General Electric Nuclear and major nuclear utilities in the United States), revenues, revenue generating events, earnings, attracting other qualified key technical advisory board members, investor relations, and other significant milestones as may be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. 

  


3.4 Participation in Employee Benefit Plans; Other Benefits. The Executive shall be permitted during the Term to participate in all employee benefit plans, policies and practices now or hereafter maintained by or on behalf of the Company commensurate with the Executive's position with the Company. During the Term, the Company will maintain a group health and dental program, group life insurance, short and long term disability insurance, 401(k) plan, paid vacation, paid sick leave, paid holidays and unpaid leave.

3.5 Expenses. The Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary expenses actually incurred or paid by the Executive during the Term in the performance of the Executive's duties under this Agreement, upon submission and approval of expense statements, vouchers or other supporting information in accordance with the then customary practices of the Company.

  


3.6 Vacation. The Executive shall be entitled to four weeks of paid vacation time per year.

  


3.7 Withholding of Taxes. The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city and other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.

  


4. Termination.

  


4.1 Termination upon Death. If the Executive dies during the Term, this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of his death.

  


4.2 Termination upon Disability. If during the Term the Executive becomes physically or mentally disabled, whether totally or partially, so that the Executive is unable to perform his essential job functions hereunder for a period aggregating 180 days during any twelve-month period, and it is determined by a physician acceptable to both the Company and the Executive that, by reason of such physical or mental disability, the Executive shall be unable to perform the essential job functions required of him hereunder for such period or periods, the Company may, by written notice to the Executive, terminate this Agreement, in which event the Term shall terminate 10 days after the date upon which the Company shall have given notice to the Executive of its intention to terminate this Agreement because of the disability. 

  


4.3 Termination for Cause. The Company may at any time by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement immediately and, except as provided in Section 5.2 hereof, the Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder on and after the date of such notice, in the event that an event of "Cause" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement "Cause" shall mean (a) conviction of a felony, bad faith or willful gross misconduct that, in any case, results in material damage to the business or reputation of the Company; or (b) willful and continued failure to perform his duties hereunder (other than such failure resulting from the Executive’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness or after the issuance of a notice of termination by the Executive for Good Reason) within 30 days after the Company delivers to him a written demand for performance that specifically identifies the actions to be performed. For purposes of this Section 4.3, no act or failure to act by the Executive shall be considered “willful” if such act is done by the Executive in the good faith belief that such act is or was to be beneficial to the Company or one or more of its businesses, or such failure to act is due to the Executive’s good faith belief that such action would be materially harmful to the Company or one of its businesses. Cause shall not exist unless and until the Company has delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors (excluding the Executive for purposes of adoption) at a meeting of the board of directors of the Company called and held for such purpose after reasonable (but in no event less than thirty days’) notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the board, finding that in the good faith opinion of the board that “Cause” exists and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. This Section 4.3 shall not prevent the Executive from challenging in any court of competent jurisdiction the board of directors’ determination that Cause exists or that the Executive has failed to cure any act (or failure to act) that purportedly formed the basis for the board of directors’ determination.

* * *

4.4 Termination without Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time, without cause, upon 30 days' written notice by the Company to the Executive and, except as provided in Section 5.1 hereof, the Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder after such termination.

  


4.5 Termination for Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason after giving the Company detailed written notice thereof, if the Company shall have failed to cure the event or circumstance constituting Good Reason within 30 business days after receiving such notice. “Good Reason” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without the written consent of the Executive: (a) the assignment to the Executive of duties inconsistent with this Agreement or a change in his titles or authority; (b) any failure by the Company to comply with Section 3 hereof in any material way; (c) the requirement of the Executive to relocate to a location that is more than 50 miles from the Executive’s work location on the effective date of this Agreement, or (d) any material breach of this Agreement by the Company. The Executive’s right to terminate his employment hereunder for Good Reason shall not be affected by his incapacity due to physical or mental illness. The Executive’s continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any act or failure to act constituting Good Reason. 

  


4.6 Without Good Reason. The Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment hereunder without Good Reason by providing the Company with 30 days advance written notice of termination.

5. Severance Payments.

  


5.1 Certain Severance Payments. If during the Term this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 or 4.5,, all compensation payable to the Executive under Section 3 hereof shall cease as of the date of termination specified in the notice of termination (the "Termination Date"), and the Company shall pay to the Executive, subject to Section 6 hereof, the following sums: (i) the Base Salary on the Termination Date for twelve months (the “Severance Period”), payable in monthly installments; (ii) benefits under group health, dental and life insurance plans and such other plans referred to in Section 3.2 that the Executive may continue to participate in as a non-employee through the Severance Period; and (iii) all previously earned, accrued, and unpaid benefits from the Company and its employee benefit plans, including any such benefits under the Company's pension, disability, and life insurance plans, policies, and programs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is terminated pursuant to Section 4.4 hereof within six months of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 8.7 hereof), then, subject to Section 6 hereof, the Severance Period shall be for six months instead of three months. If, prior to the date on which the Company's obligations under clause (i) of this Section 5.1 cease, the Executive violates Section 6 hereof, then the Company shall have no obligation to make any of the payments that remain payable by the Company under clauses (i) and (iii) of this Section 5.1 on or after the date of such violation. 

  


Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, based on Internal Revenue Service guidance available as of the date the payment or provision of any amount or other benefit is specified to be made under this Agreement or elsewhere, the Company reasonably determines that the payment or provision of such amount or other benefit at such specified time may potentially subject the Executive to “additional tax” under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to, or in connection with, such tax, a “409A Tax”) with respect to the payment of such amount or the provision of such benefit, and if payment or provision thereof at a later date would likely avoid any such 409A Tax, then the payment or provision thereof shall be postponed to the earliest business day on which the Company reasonably determines such amount or benefit can be paid or provided without incurring any such 409A Tax, but in no event later than the first business day after the six-month anniversary of the Executive’s termination date (the “Delayed Payment Date”). In addition, if the Company reasonably determines that such 409A Tax with respect to the provision of a benefit can likely be avoided by replacing the benefit with the payment of an amount in cash equal to the cost of a substantially equivalent benefit then, in lieu providing such benefit, the Company may make such cash payment, subject to the preceding sentence. The Company and the Executive may agree to take other actions to avoid the imposition of 409A Tax at such time and in such manner as permitted under Section 409A. In the event that a delay of any payment is required under this provision, such payment shall be accumulated and paid in a single lump sum on the Delayed Payment Date together with interest for the period of delay, compounded monthly, equal to the prime or base lending rate then used by Citibank, N. A., in New York City and in effect as of the date the payment would otherwise have been provided.

5.2 Payments upon Termination for Cause or Termination without Good Reason. If this Employment Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof or by the Executive pursuant to Sections 4.5(a)-(d) or 4.6 hereof, the Executive shall receive only the amounts specified in clause (ii) of Section 5.1 hereof.

  


6. Certain Covenants of the Executive.

In addition, during the Restricted Period, the Executive shall not develop any property for use in the Company's Business on behalf of any person or entity other than the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

If the Executive breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of Section 6 hereof (collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, in addition to the rights set forth in Section 5.1 hereof, have the right and remedy to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction specific performance of the Restrictive Covenants or injunctive relief against any act which would violate any of the Restrictive Covenants, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

  


6.7 Severability of Covenants. If any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or any foreign, federal, state, county or local government or other governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against public policy for any reason, the remainder of the Restrictive Covenants shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and such court, government, agency or authority shall be empowered to substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar thereto or other provisions so as to provide to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by such provisions.

6.8 Enforceability in Jurisdictions. The parties intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants wholly invalid or unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of the parties that such determination not bar or in any way affect the Company's right to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants, as to breaches of such Restrictive Covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, such Restrictive Covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.

  


7. Indemnification. 

  


7.1 General. The Company agrees that if the Executive is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), other than a Proceeding initiated by the Company to enforce its rights under this Agreement, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was a trustee, director or officer of the Company, or any predecessor to the Company or any of their Affiliates or is or was serving at the request of the Company, any predecessor to the Company, or any of their affiliates as a trustee, director, officer, member, employee or agent of another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise, including, without limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether or not the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a trustee, director, officer, member, employee or agent while serving as a trustee, director, officer, member, employee or agent, the Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by Nevada law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all Expenses incurred or suffered by the Executive in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to the Executive even if the Executive has ceased to be an officer, director, trustee or agent, or is no longer employed by the Company and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators.
