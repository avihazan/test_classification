relating thereto may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Employee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Performance Shares or any of the rights related thereto prior to the vesting of such Performance Shares shall be wholly ineffective and shall not be recognized by the Company for any purpose, except that any Performance Shares which, pursuant to the terms hereof, vest following the death or Disability of the Employee may be paid to the Employee’s heirs, estate, agents, beneficiaries or assigns. 

7\. Provisions of Plan. Except as provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Plan, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made part hereof. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that he or she has been provided with and has read the Plan and understands the provisions thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall take precedence, other than for such provisions of the Plan which, by their terms, are subject to the provisions of an Award Certificate. 

8\. No ERISA Plan. Neither this Agreement nor the award of the Performance-Shares hereunder shall be construed by any party as being subject to any provisions of ERISA, and shall not be so subject. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Performance Shares awarded hereunder shall constitute a mere unfunded promise to pay by the Company and a bonus program within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-2(c) promulgated under ERISA. 

9\. Notices. Any notice required to be delivered to the Company under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Secretary of the Company at the Company’s principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be delivered to the Employee under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Employee at the Employee’s address as shown in the records of the Company. Either party may designate another address in writing (or by such other method approved by the Company) from time to time. 

10\. Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, all unvested Performance Shares shall accelerate and immediately vest upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, such acceleration and vesting to be deemed to have occurred at such time as may be necessary or required in order for the Employee to be deemed the lawful owner and holder of record as of the effective date and time of the Change in Control. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “unvested Performance Shares” shall mean, (i) as of any date of determination following the last day of Fiscal Year 2013, the maximum number of Performance Shares then payable hereunder or subject to vesting hereunder, as determined under Section 2 above, assuming that all conditions to issuance and vesting hereunder have been satisfied and (ii) as of any date of determination prior to or as of the last day of Fiscal Year 2013, the maximum number of Performance Shares then payable hereunder or subject to vesting hereunder, as determined under Section 2 above, assuming that the minimum Target Bonus Target has been achieved and all conditions to issuance and vesting hereunder have been satisfied.

11\. Parachute Payments and Parachute Awards. If the Employee is a “disqualified individual,” as defined in paragraph (c) of Code Section 280G, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Employee and the Company (an “Other Agreement”), except an agreement, contract, or understanding that expressly addresses Code Section 280G or Code Section 4999 (a “280G Agreement”), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the Employee (or an employee group of which the Employee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Employee (a “Benefit Arrangement”), any right the Employee has in respect of payment under this Agreement, any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement will be reduced or eliminated: (a) to the extent that such right to payment, taking into account all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Employee under all Other Agreements and all Benefit Arrangements, would cause the payment to Employee under this Agreement to be considered a “parachute payment” within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of Code Section 280G as then in effect (a “Parachute Payment”); and (b) if, as a result of receiving such Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax amounts the Employee is entitled to receive from the Company under all Other Agreements and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the Employee without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. The Company will accomplish such reduction in a manner to be mutually agreed with, and most beneficial for, the Employee. The foregoing shall not be interpreted so as to restrict, reduce, amend or modify any of the existing terms and provisions of any 280G Agreement to which the Employee and the Company may be a party, and any payment hereunder shall be entitled to the benefits thereof. 

12\. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. 

13\. Modification. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, this Agreement may be modified only in writing pursuant to an agreement by and between the Company and the Employee. 

14\. Headings. The headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not be construed by any party as having any substantive significance. 

15\. Clawback. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, this Award is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement, and is subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by the Company at any time pursuant to any such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement).

16\. Section 409A of the Code. It is intended that all payments under this Agreement qualify as short-term deferrals exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any payment hereunder does not qualify for treatment as an exempt short-term deferral, it is intended that such payment shall be paid in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. 

17\. Execution and Counterparts. This Agreement shall be deemed executed and delivered by the parties upon the execution of the individual Award Certificate issued to the Employee in connection herewith, which Award Certificate shall be executed by an authorized officer of the Company and may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and shall be effective when a counterpart thereof has been received from both parties.
