(c) Certificates. A certificate evidencing the Restricted Shares shall be issued by the Company in the Director’s name, pursuant to which the Director shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Shares, including, without limitation, voting rights and the right to receive dividends (provided, however, that dividends paid in shares of the Company’s stock shall be subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions and further provided that dividends that are paid other than in shares of the Company’s stock shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year in which the dividend for such class of stock is paid to stockholders of such class or, if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date the dividend is paid to stockholders of such class of stock). The Director may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the stock until the Forfeiture Restrictions have expired, and a breach of the terms of this Agreement shall cause a forfeiture of the Restricted Shares. The certificate shall be delivered upon issuance to the Secretary of the Company or to such other depository as may be designated by the Committee as a depository for safekeeping until the forfeiture of such Restricted Shares occurs or the Forfeiture Restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. On the Date of Grant, the Director shall deliver to the Company a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Shares. Upon the lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions without forfeiture, the Company shall cause a new certificate or certificates to be issued without legend (except for any legend required pursuant to applicable securities laws or any other agreement to which the Director is a party) in the name of the Director in exchange for the certificate evidencing the Restricted Shares. 

(d) Corporate Acts.

The prohibitions of Section 3(a) hereof shall not apply to the transfer of Restricted Shares pursuant to a plan of reorganization of the Company, but the stock, securities or other property received in exchange therefor shall also become subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions and provisions governing the lapsing of such Forfeiture Restrictions applicable to the original Restricted Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, and the certificates representing such stock, securities or other property shall be legended to show such restrictions. 

4\. Withholding of Tax. To the extent that the receipt of the Restricted Shares or the lapse of any Forfeiture Restrictions results in compensation income or wages to the Director for federal, state or local tax purposes, the Director shall deliver to the Company at the time of such receipt or lapse, as the case may be, such amount of money as the Company may require to meet its minimum obligation under applicable tax laws or regulations, and if the Director fails to do so, the Company is authorized to withhold from any cash or stock remuneration (including withholding any Restricted Shares or Earned Shares distributable to the Director under this Agreement) then or thereafter payable to the Director any tax required to be withheld by reason of such resulting compensation income or wages. The Director acknowledges and agrees that the Company is making no representation or warranty as to the tax consequences to the Director

The Director also agrees that (a) the certificates representing the Restricted Shares and Earned Shares may bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the Forfeiture Restrictions and to assure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and applicable securities laws, (b) the Company may refuse to register the transfer of the Restricted Shares or Earned Shares on the stock transfer records of the Company if such proposed transfer would constitute a violation of the Forfeiture Restrictions or, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, of any applicable securities law, and (c) the Company may give related instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of the Restricted Shares. 

6\. Membership on the Board. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the Restricted Shares thereunder pursuant to this Agreement, shall confer upon the Director the right to continued membership on the Board or affect in any way the right of the Company to terminate such membership at any time. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of the Director’s membership on the Board, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Board or its delegate, and its determination shall be final. 

7\. Notices. Any notices or other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing. In the case of the Director, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if hand delivered to the Director or if sent by registered or certified mail to the Director at the last address the Director has filed with the Company. In the case of the Company, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if sent by registered or certified mail to the Company at its principal executive offices. 

8\. Entire Agreement; Amendment.

9\. Binding Effect; Survival. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors to the Company and all persons lawfully claiming under the Director. The provisions of Section 5 shall survive the lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions without forfeiture.
