(ii) If the Optionee’s employment with the Corporation is terminated and the Payroll Separation Date is on or after the Optionee’s attainment of age 60 but prior to the Optionee’s attainment of age 65, this Option will continue to vest as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement and the Optionee will have five years from the Payroll Separation Date to exercise the Optionee’s vested Options. 

(iii) If the Optionee’s employment with the Corporation is terminated and the Payroll Separation Date is on or after the Optionee’s attainment of age 65, this Option will automatically become fully exercisable upon the Termination Date (if the Optionee is age 65 on such date or otherwise upon the date on which the Optionee turns age 65) and the Optionee will have seven years from the Payroll Separation Date to exercise the Optionee’s vested Options.

Change in Control Event, as defined in Section 2.4 of the Plan. However, if the Optionee’s employment is terminated by the Corporation “without cause,” as defined in Section 4.6(d) of the Plan, within two years after the occurrence of a Change in Control Event occurring after the date of this grant, this Option shall automatically become fully exercisable and the Optionee will have one year from the Payroll Separation Date to exercise the Optionee’s vested Options.

(e) Death. If the Optionee shall die while employed by the Corporation, or within a period following termination of employment during which this Option remains exercisable, the then remaining unvested portion of this Option shall automatically become fully exercisable and the executor or administrator of the Optionee’s estate or the person or persons to whom the Optionee shall have transferred such right by Will or by the laws of descent and distribution will have two years from the date of death to exercise the Optionee’s vested Options. 

(f) Sale of Business Unit or Subsidiary. If the Optionee’s employment with the Corporation is terminated by the Corporation due to the sale of a business unit or subsidiary of the Corporation by which the Optionee is employed, and the Optionee is not displaced/separated pursuant to the Mellon Financial Corporation Displacement Program/The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Separation Plan or other termination by the Corporation providing transition/separation pay, upon the Termination Date, any then unvested Options, if any, shall vest on a pro-rata basis equal to (i) the number of whole and fractional months from the date of this grant through the Termination Date, divided by (ii) 48 months which is the full vesting period of this grant, with the result multiplied by (iii) the total number of the Options granted hereunder, with that result reduced by (iv) the number of Options that were already vested as of the Termination Date, and all remaining Options will expire immediately.

SECTION 5: Miscellaneous

5.1 Whenever the word “Optionee” is used in any provision of this Option under circumstances where the provision should logically be construed to apply to the executors, the administrators or the person or persons to whom this Option may be transferred as permitted herein, the word “Optionee” shall be deemed to include such person or persons. 

5.2 This Option may not be transferred except by the Optionee upon his or her death. No other assignment or transfer of this Option, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise shall be permitted, but immediately upon any such assignment or transfer this Option shall terminate and become of no further effect. This Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or by an entity or other person to which this section permits transfer and shall remain subject to any restrictions on exercise and otherwise as if held by the Optionee. The Corporation shall have received an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, local or other withholding tax requirements prior to crediting the shares issuable upon exercise of this Option to a book-entry account. 

5.3 If there is any change in the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, split-up, spin-out, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares, or any other similar transaction, the number and kind of shares subject to this Option and the Option Price, as applicable, shall be appropriately adjusted by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Committee”). 

5.4 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Optionee hereby agrees that he or she will not exercise the Option granted hereby, and that the Corporation will not be obligated to issue any shares to the Optionee hereunder, if the exercise thereof or the issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the Optionee or the Corporation of any provision of law or regulation of any governmental authority. Any determination in this connection by the 

-5-

Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Corporation shall in no event be obliged to register any securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (as the same shall be in effect from time to time) or to take any other affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of the Option or the issuance of shares pursuant thereto to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. 

5.5 No amount of income received by an Optionee pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered compensation for purposes of any pension or retirement plan, insurance plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Corporation. 

5.6 The parties hereto agree that the Option granted hereby is not, and should not be construed to be, an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. 

5.7 The Optionee accepts the grant of the Option confirmed hereby, and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan, as the Plan may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that no alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the Plan shall, without the written consent of the Optionee, adversely affect the rights of the Optionee with respect to the Option. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof, should there be any inconsistency between the provisions of this Option and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the provisions in the Plan shall govern and prevail. A copy of the Plan may be obtained by writing or calling the Corporate Compensation Division of the Corporation’s Human Resources Department in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

5.8 In the event the Optionee fails to comply with any rules or regulations the Corporation establishes with respect to its businesses (including the Corporation’s Code of Conduct and Interpretive Guidance), the Corporation may cancel or revoke all or any portion of this Option with respect to the shares not yet exercised. The Corporation shall have sole discretion to determine what constitutes such failure. 

5.9 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, other than any choice of law rules calling for the application of laws of another jurisdiction.
