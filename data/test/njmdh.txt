Unless earlier terminated, this option shall expire on [____________] (the “Final Exercise Date”).

Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term “Participant”, as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms.

2. Vesting Schedule.

This option will become exercisable (“vest”) in installments over a four year period commencing one year after the date of grant, with 25% becoming vested one year after the date of grant and an additional 6.25% of the original number of shares at the end of each successive three-month period following the first anniversary of the grant date until the fourth anniversary of the grant date.

The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan.
