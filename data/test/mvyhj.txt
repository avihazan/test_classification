Employer may terminate this agreement with or without cause at any time.

  


If the termination is without cause, Employee shall be entitled to a lump sum payment of pay in a sum equivalent to that required by applicable law at the time of termination, to be paid to Employee within 15 days of receiving notice of his termination (the “Severance”). If Employee agrees to execute and deliver a release to Employer upon such a termination whereby Employee expressly and unconditionally agrees to release and forever discharge Employer, its affiliates, attorneys, agents, successors and assigns, jointly and individually, of and from any and all possible claims, rights, demands, costs, actions, causes of action, obligations, damages, and liabilities (“claims”) whether known or unknown and of whatever kind or nature, which arose on or before the date of termination of the Employee, arising out of or in any way related to, or as a consequence of, Employee’s employment or other affiliation with the Employer, the terms and conditions of that employment, and the termination of such employment, as well as the continuing effects thereof, then Employee shall be paid one month of Employee’s base pay for each full year of employment of Employee by the Company in consideration for such a release of claims by Employee.

If the termination is with cause, Employee shall not be entitled to any compensation beyond the termination of his employment, nor shall he be entitled to notice, beyond that required by law. "Cause" for purposes of this Agreement shall include: (i) conviction of a felony, any act involving moral turpitude, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment is imposed, (ii) commission of any act of theft, fraud, material dishonesty, or falsification of any employment or other records belonging to Employer, (iii) improper disclosure of the confidential or proprietary information of Employer, (iv) any material breach of this Agreement, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice of such breach, (v) a course of conduct amounting to gross incompetence or violation of Employer‘s employment policies, including but not limited to its policies against discrimination and harassment, (vi) misappropriation of funds or property of Employer.

  


Employee may terminate this Agreement at any time, upon 30 days' notice to the Employer. Upon such termination by Employee, he shall provide reasonable assistance to the Employer in locating a successor. Upon such termination by Employee, Employee hereby expressly and unconditionally releases and forever discharges Employer, its affiliates, attorneys, agents, successors and assigns, jointly and individually, of and from any and all claims, whether known or unknown and of whatever kind or nature, which arose on or before the date of termination of the Employee, arising out of or in any way related to, or as a consequence of, Employee’s employment or other affiliation with the Employer, the terms and conditions of that employment, and the termination of such employment, as well as the continuing effects thereof.

Employer and Employee acknowledge and agree that during the term of this Agreement and in the course of performing Employee’s duties hereunder, Employee shall have access to and become acquainted with Proprietary and Confidential Information concerning the operation of Employer.

  


Proprietary Information is all information and any idea whatever form, tangible or intangible, pertaining in any manner to the business of Employer, or its employees, consultants, or business associates, which was produced by any employee or consultant of Employer in the course of his or her employment or consulting relationship or otherwise produced or acquired by or on behalf of Employer. All Proprietary Information not generally known outside of Employer's organization or that of its customers, and all Proprietary Information so known only through improper means, shall be deemed “Confidential Information”. By example and without limiting the foregoing definition, Proprietary and Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to:

  


(i) formulas, research and development techniques, processes, trade secrets, computer programs, software, electronic codes, mask works, inventions, innovations, patents, patent applications, discoveries, improvements, data, know-how, formats, test results, and research projects;

(v) Employee personnel files and compensation information.

  


“Confidential Information” includes all information that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Employer is engaged or contemplates engaging, and all information of which the unauthorized disclosure could be detrimental to the interests of Employer, whether or not such information is identified as Confidential Information by Employer.

  


Employer owns and has developed and compiled, and will develop and compile, certain trade secrets, proprietary techniques and other Confidential Information which have great value to its business.

Employee will not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any third party, other than in Employee’s assigned duties and for the benefit of Employer, any of Employer's Confidential Information, either during or after employment with Employer. Employee acknowledges being aware that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may be highly prejudicial to its interests, an invasion of privacy, and an improper disclosure of trade secrets.

The obligations contained in this section shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Employee shall mark all Subject Ideas and Inventions with the copyright or other proprietary notice of Employer, as directed by Employer, and shall take all actions deemed necessary by Employer to protect the rights of those parties therein. In the event that the Subject Ideas and Inventions shall be deemed not to constitute works made for hire, or in the event that Employee should otherwise, by operation of law, be deemed to retain any rights (whether moral rights or otherwise) to any Subject Ideas and Inventions, Employee agrees to assign to Employer, without further consideration, Employee=s entire right, title and interest in and to each and every such Subject Idea and Invention.
