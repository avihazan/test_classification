6. No Fractional Shares. The Stock Option may be exercised only with respect to full shares, and no fractional share of stock shall be issued.

7. Manner of Exercise. Subject to such administrative regulations as the Committee may from time to time adopt, the Stock Option may be exercised by the delivery of written notice to the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Option is to be exercised, the date of exercise thereof (the “Exercise Date”) which shall be at least three (3) days after giving such notice unless an earlier time shall have been mutually agreed upon, and whether the Optioned Shares to be exercised will be considered as deemed granted under an Incentive Stock Option as provided in Section 11. On the Exercise Date, the Participant shall deliver to the Company consideration with a value equal to the total Option Price of the shares to be purchased, payable as follows: (a) cash, check, bank draft, or money order payable to the order of the Company, (b) Common Stock (including Restricted Stock and Callable Shares) owned by the Participant on the Exercise Date, valued at its Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, and which the Participant has not acquired from the Company within six (6) months prior to the Exercise Date; provided, that the six (6)-month holding requirement shall only apply to a Reporting Participant at any time following an IPO, (c) if the Company has completed an IPO, by delivery (including by FAX) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions from the Participant to a broker or dealer, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to sell certain of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or to pledge such shares as collateral for a loan and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay such purchase price, and/or (d) in any other form of valid consideration that is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event that shares of Restricted Stock or Callable Shares are tendered as consideration for the exercise of a Stock Option, a number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of the Stock Option equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock or Callable Shares used as consideration therefor shall be subject to the same restrictions and provisions as the Restricted Stock or Callable Shares so tendered.

Upon payment of all amounts due from the Participant, the Company shall cause certificates for the Optioned Shares then being purchased to be delivered to the Participant (or the person exercising the Participant’s Stock Option in the event of his death) at its principal business office within ten (10) business days after the Exercise Date. The obligation of the Company to deliver shares of Common Stock shall, however, be subject to the condition that if at any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the listing, registration, or qualification of the Stock Option or the Optioned Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with, the Stock Option or the issuance or purchase of shares of Common Stock thereunder, then the Stock Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing,

3

* * *

  


registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not reasonably acceptable to the Committee.

If the Participant fails to pay for any of the Optioned Shares specified in such notice or fails to accept delivery thereof, then the Stock Option, and right to purchase such Optioned Shares may be forfeited by the Company.

8. Nonassignability. The Stock Option is not assignable or transferable by the Participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

9. Rights as Stockholder. The Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the Stock Option until the issuance of a certificate or certificates to the Participant for the Optioned Shares. The Optioned Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement regarding such Optioned Shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of such certificate or certificates.

10. Adjustment of Number of Optioned Shares and Related Matters. The number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Stock Option, and the Option Prices thereof, shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Articles 11 - 13 of the Plan.

11. Incentive Stock Option. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, this Stock Option is an Incentive Stock Option. To the extent the number of Optioned Shares exceeds the limit set forth in Section 6.3 of the Plan, such Optioned Shares shall be deemed granted pursuant to a Nonqualified Stock Option. Unless otherwise indicated by the Participant in the notice of exercise pursuant to Section 7, upon any exercise of this Stock Option, the number of exercised Optioned Shares that shall be deemed to be exercised pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option shall equal the total number of Optioned Shares so exercised multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of unexercised Optioned Shares that could then be exercised pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the denominator of which is the then total number of unexercised Optioned Shares.

12. Disqualifying Disposition. In the event that Common Stock acquired upon exercise of this Stock Option is disposed of by the Participant in a “Disqualifying Disposition,” such Participant shall notify the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after such disposition of the date and terms of such disposition. For purposes hereof, “Disqualifying Disposition” shall mean a disposition of Common Stock that is acquired upon the exercise of this Stock Option (and that is not deemed granted pursuant to a Nonqualified Stock Option under Section 11) prior to the expiration of either two years from the Date of Grant of this Stock Option or one year from the transfer of shares to the Participant pursuant to the exercise of this Stock Option.

13. Restrictions on Optioned Shares. The Participant and any Optioned Shares he or she may acquire shall be subject to and governed by the terms, provisions and restrictions set forth in that certain (i) Stockholders’ Agreement (herein so called), dated as of October 3, 2005, among the Company and the Company stockholders signatory thereto, and (ii) Registration Rights Agreement (herein so called), dated as of October 3, 2005, among the Company and the Company stockholders signatory thereto.

14. Voting. The Participant, as record holder of some or all of the Optioned Shares following exercise of this Stock Option, has the exclusive right to vote, or consent with respect to, such Optioned Shares until such time as the Optioned Shares are transferred in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however,

4

* * *

  


that this Section shall not create any voting right where the holders of such Optioned Shares otherwise have no such right.

15. Community Property. Each spouse individually is bound by, and such spouse’s interest, if any, in any Optioned Shares is subject to, the terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall create a community property interest where none otherwise exists.

16. Dispute Resolution.

a. Arbitration. All disputes and controversies of every kind and nature between any parties hereto arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions described herein as to the construction, validity, interpretation or meaning, performance, non-performance, enforcement, operation or breach, shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the following procedures:

i. After a dispute or controversy arises, any party may, in a written notice delivered to the other parties to the dispute, demand such arbitration. Such notice shall designate the name of the arbitrator (who shall be an impartial person) appointed by such party demanding arbitration, together with a statement of the matter in controversy.

ii. Within 30 days after receipt of such demand, the other parties shall, in a written notice delivered to the first party, name such parties’ arbitrator (who shall be an impartial person). If such parties fail to name an arbitrator, then the second arbitrator shall be named by the American Arbitration Association (the AAA). The two arbitrators so selected shall name a third arbitrator (who shall be an impartial person) within 30 days, or in lieu of such agreement on a third arbitrator by the two arbitrators so appointed, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. If any arbitrator appointed hereunder shall die, resign, refuse or become unable to act before an arbitration decision is rendered, then the vacancy shall be filled by the method set forth in this Section for the original appointment of such arbitrator.

iii. Each party shall bear its own arbitration costs and expenses. The arbitration hearing shall be held in Dallas, Texas at a location designated by a majority of the arbitrators. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association shall be incorporated by reference at such hearing and the substantive laws of the State of Texas (excluding conflict of laws provisions) shall apply.

iv.

An award rendered by a majority of the arbitrators appointed pursuant to this Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties to the proceeding, shall resolve the question of costs of the arbitrators and all related matters, and judgment on such award may be entered and enforced by either party in any court of competent jurisdiction.

v. Except as set forth in Section 16.b., the parties stipulate that the provisions of this Section shall be a complete defense to any suit, action or proceeding instituted in any federal, state or local court or before any administrative tribunal with respect to any controversy or dispute arising out of this Agreement or the transactions described herein. The

5

arbitration provisions hereof shall, with respect to such controversy or dispute, survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

No party to an arbitration may disclose the existence or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties; nor will any party to an arbitration disclose to any third party any confidential information disclosed by any other party to an arbitration in the course of an arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of such other party.

b. Emergency Relief. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16 to the contrary, any party may seek from a court any provisional remedy that may be necessary to protect any rights or property of such party pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal or its determination of the merits of the controversy or to enforce a party’s rights under Section 16.

17. Participant’s Representations. Notwithstanding any of the provisions hereof, the Participant hereby agrees that he will not exercise the Stock Option granted hereby, and that the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to the Participant hereunder, if the exercise thereof or the issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the Participant or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority.

Unless the Common Stock is issued to the Participant in a transaction registered under the applicable federal and state securities laws, all certificates issued with respect to the Common Stock shall bear an appropriate restrictive investment legend and shall be held indefinitely, unless they are subsequently registered under the applicable federal and state securities laws or the Participant obtains an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and its counsel, that such registration is not required.

On the face of the certificate:

“Transfer of this stock is restricted in accordance with conditions printed on the reverse of this certificate.”
