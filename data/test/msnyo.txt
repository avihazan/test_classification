19\. General Provisions.

(a) Goodwill. The Company has invested substantial time and money in the development of its products, services, territories, advertising and marketing thereof, soliciting clients and creating goodwill. By accepting employment with the Company, the Executive acknowledges that the Customers are the customers of the Company and that any goodwill created by the Executive belongs to and shall inure to the benefit of the Company.

(b) Acknowledgment. The Executive acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Sections 17 and 18 are reasonable in scope and essential to the preservation of the Business and proprietary properties that belong to the Company and that the enforcement thereof will not in any manner preclude the Executive, in the event of the Executive’s termination of employment with the Company, from becoming gainfully employed in such manner and to such extent as to provide a standard of living for himself, the members of his family, and those dependent upon him of at least the sort and fashion to which he and they have become accustomed and may expect.

(c) Severability. The covenants of the Executive contained in Sections 16, 17 and 18 of this Agreement shall each be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Executive against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants. In the event that any part of any covenant of this Agreement is determined by a court of law to be overly broad thereby making the covenant unenforceable, the parties hereto agree, and it is their desire, that such court shall, to the extent permitted, substitute a judicially enforceable limitation in its place, and that as so modified, the covenant shall be binding upon the parties as if originally set forth herein. Additionally, both parties hereby expressly agree and contract that it is not the intention of either party to violate any public policy, or statutory or common law, and that if any provision of this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held unenforceable and a court is not permitted to substitute a judicially enforceable limitation in its place, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement unless, as a result of such severance, the Agreement fails to reflect the basic intent of the parties. If the Agreement continues to reflect the basic intent of the parties, then the invalidity of such specific provision shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision herein, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
