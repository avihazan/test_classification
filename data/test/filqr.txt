The availability and amount of such bonus will be determined in the sole discretion of the Company.

6\. Covenant Not to Disclose Confidential Information. Employee acknowledges that during the course of his employment with the Company Employee has had and will continue to have access to and knowledge of certain information and data that the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company considers confidential and that the release of such information or data to any unauthorized person or entity would be extremely detrimental to the Company. As a consequence, Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that he owes a duty to the Company not to disclose, and agrees that, during and after the term of his employment, without the prior written consent of the Company, he will not communicate, publish or disclose, to any person or entity anywhere or use (for his own benefit or the benefit of others) any Confidential Information (as defined below) for any purpose other than carrying out his duties as contemplated by this Agreement. Employee will use his best efforts at all times to hold in confidence and to safeguard any Confidential Information to ensure that any unauthorized persons and entities do not gain possession of any Confidential Information and, in particular, will not permit any Confidential Information to be read, duplicated or copied. Employee will return to the Company all originals and copies of documents and other materials, whether in printed or electronic format or otherwise, containing or derived from Confidential Information in Employee’s possession or under Employee’s control when the duties of Employee no longer require Employee’s possession thereof, or whenever the Company requests, and in any event will return all such Confidential Information within ten days if the employment relationship with the Company is terminated for any or no reason and will not retain any copies thereof. Employee acknowledges that Employee is obligated to protect the Confidential Information from disclosure or use even after termination of the employment relationship. The term “Confidential Information” means any information or data used by or belonging or relating to the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company, or any party to whom the Company owes a duty of confidentiality that is not known generally to the industry in which the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company, or any party to whom the Company owes a duty of confidentiality is or may be engaged, including all trade secrets, proprietary data and information relating to the Company’s or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company’s, or any party to whom the Company owes a duty of confidentiality past, present or future business and products, price lists, customer lists, acquisition candidates and criteria relating to potential acquisition candidates, processes, procedures or standards, know-how, manuals, hardware, software, source code, business strategies, records, marketing plans, drawings, technical information, specifications, designs, patent information, financial information, whether or not reduced to writing, or information or data that the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company or any party to whom the Company owes a duty of confidentiality advises Employee should be treated as confidential information. Confidential Information does not include any

* * *

information that: (i) is rightfully known to Employee prior to Employee’s employment, and independent of any disclosure or access to the information via the Company as evidenced by Employee’s written records; or (ii) is or later becomes part of the public domain and known within the relevant industry through no fault of Employee. 

7\. Disclosure and Assignment of Intellectual Property. 

(a) Employee agrees that the Company will become the owner of all inventions, discoveries, developments, ideas, writings, and expressions, including all concepts, improvements, techniques, know-how, innovations, systems, processes, machines, current or proposed products, works, information, reports, papers, logos, computer programs, designs, marketing materials, and methods of manufacture, distribution, management or other methods (whether or not reduced to writing and whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright), that Employee conceives, develops, creates, makes, perfects or reduces to practice in whole or in part while employed by the Company or within one year after termination of Employee’s employment for any or no reason, and that: (i) directly or indirectly relate to or arise out of Employee’s job responsibilities for the Company or the performance of the duties of Employee’s employment by the Company; (ii) result from research, development, or other activities of the Company; or (iii) relate or pertain in any way to the existing or reasonably anticipated business, products or services of the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company (collectively, the “Intellectual Property”). All of the right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property will become exclusively owned by the Company or its nominee regardless of whether or not the conception, development, creation, making, perfection or reduction to practice of such Intellectual Property involved the use of the Company’s time, facilities or materials and regardless of where such Intellectual Property may be conceived, made or perfected. 

(b) Employee will promptly and fully disclose in writing to the Company all inventions, discoveries, developments, ideas, writings, and expressions conceived, developed, created, made, perfected or reduced to practice, in whole or in part, while employed by the Company or within one year after termination of Employee’s employment for any or no reason, regardless of whether Employee believes the invention, discovery, development, writing, expression or idea should be considered Intellectual Property of the Company under any provision of this Agreement, in order to enable the Company to make a determination as to its rights with respect to the same. 

(c) All information relating to Intellectual Property will be considered Confidential Information and may not be disclosed by Employee to any person or entity outside of the Company. 

(d) Any Intellectual Property that is the subject of copyright will be considered a “work made for hire” within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, and is the sole property of the Company or its nominee. To the extent that the Company does not automatically own any such Intellectual Property as a work made for hire, Employee will assign all right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property to the Company. All right, title and interest in and to any other Intellectual 

3 

* * *

Property, including patent, industrial design, trademark, trade dress and trade secret rights will be assigned and is hereby assigned exclusively to the Company or its nominee. Employee will also execute and deliver all documents and do all acts that the Company considers necessary or desirable to secure to the Company or its nominee the entire right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property, including executing applications for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations, disclosing relevant prior art, reviewing office actions and providing technical input to assist the Company in overcoming any rejections. Any document prepared and filed pursuant to this Section 7(d) will be prepared and filed at the Company’s expense. Employee will also cooperate with the Company as reasonably necessary to maintain or enforce the Company’s rights in the Intellectual Property. Employee hereby irrevocably appoints the President of the Company as Employee’s attorney-in-fact with authority to execute for Employee and on Employee’s behalf all assignments, patent or copyright applications, or other instruments and documents required to be executed by Employee pursuant to this Section 7(d), if Employee is unwilling or unable to execute same. 

(e) The Company will have no obligation to use, attempt to protect by patent or copyright, or promote any of the Intellectual Property; provided, however, that the Company, in its sole discretion, may reward Employee for any especially meritorious contributions in any manner it deems appropriate or may provide Employee with full or partial releases as to any subject matter contributed by Employee in which the Company is not interested. 

8\. Legal Proceedings to Compel Disclosure. If Employee is requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law, regulation, or legal process, to disclose any Confidential Information or Intellectual Property, Employee will notify the Company of such request within five days of such request being made and will enable the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company to seek an appropriate protective order. If such a protective order or other protective remedy is not obtained, Employee will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information or Intellectual Property that, in the opinion of Employee’s counsel, is legally required and will exercise Employee’s best efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information or Intellectual Property. 

9\. Covenant Not to Compete. Employee acknowledges that during his employment with the Company he, at the expense of the Company, has been and will continue to be specially trained in the business of the Company, has established and will continue to establish favorable relations with the customers, clients and accounts of the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company and has had and will continue to have access to the Intellectual Property, trade secrets and Confidential Information of the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company. Therefore, in consideration of such training and relations, and in consideration of his continued employment with the Company, the increase in compensation and additional benefits provided in this Agreement, the issuance of restricted units pursuant to a separate Restricted Unit Award Agreement dated the date hereof (the “Restricted Unit Agreement”), and to further protect the Intellectual Property, trade secrets and Confidential Information of the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company, Employee agrees that during the term of his employment by the Company and for a period of two (2) years from and after your resignation or the voluntary or involuntary termination of such

The “New England States” are defined as Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island or Connecticut. 

(b) contact any Potential Acquisition Target, or in any way assist any individual or entity in contacting, evaluating or acquiring a Potential Acquisition Target; 

The term Potential Acquisition Target shall mean any business which the Company has made formal offer to purchase, entered into a letter of intent to purchase, participated in a purchase auction, received a request to bid, or targeted for purchase, or received non-public transactional ideas, financial or operation information while Employee was employed by the Company.

(d) entice or induce or in any manner influence any person who is or becomes in the employ or service of the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company to leave such employ or service for the purpose of engaging in a business that may be in competition with any business now or at any time during the period hereof engaged in by the Company or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate of the Company. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, Employee may (i) take action for, on behalf of, and at the direction of the Company pursuant to a written agreement with the Company or otherwise, and (ii) own up to 5% of the outstanding equity securities in any corporation or entity (including units in a master limited partnership) that is listed upon a national stock exchange or actively traded in the over-the-counter market.

Company’s remedies at law for any such breach or threatened breach will be inadequate, the Company, in addition to such other remedies that may be available to it, will be entitled to an injunction, including a mandatory injunction, to be issued by any court of competent jurisdiction ordering compliance with this Agreement or enjoining and restraining Employee, and each and every person and entity acting in concert or participation with him, from the continuation of such breach and, in addition thereto, he will pay to the Company all ascertainable damages, including costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees sustained by the Company by reason of the breach or threatened breach of such covenants and assurances.
