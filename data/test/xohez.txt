(b)Defined terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 2 of the Plan.

  


(c)The RSUs granted hereunder represent a portion of the Participant's incentive award under the Company's 2009 Annual Incentive Plan, or a predecessor plan (the “AIP”). The AIP is a stockholder approved plan intended to provide “performance-based” compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Under the AIP, a portion of each participant's annual incentive award may not be made in cash, but must instead be made in the form of restricted stock units.

  


(d)Subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in the Plan and herein, each RSU granted hereunder represents the right to receive from the Company, on the scheduled vesting date set forth in Section 2(a) of this Agreement or on such earlier date as provided in Section 5 of this Agreement (the “Vesting Date”), one share (a “Share”) of common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”), free of any restrictions, all amounts notionally credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Account (as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement) with respect to such RSU, and all securities and property comprising all Property Distributions (as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement) deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such RSU.

  


(e)Provided the conditions of Section 6 of this Agreement have been met, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date (but no later than 30 days from such date) for any RSUs granted hereunder, the Participant shall receive from the Company the number of Shares to which the vested RSUs relate, free of any restrictions, a cash payment for all amounts notionally credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such vested RSUs, and all securities and property comprising all Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such vested RSUs.

Equivalent Account related to such RSU shall be subject to forfeiture as provided in Section 5 of this Agreement.

  


3.Except as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, an RSU shall not entitle the Participant to any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in any Share until the RSU shall vest and the Participant shall be issued the Share to which such RSU relates nor in any securities or property comprising any Property Distribution deposited in a Dividend Equivalent Account related to such RSU until such RSU vests.

All such credits shall be made notionally to a dividend equivalent account (a “Dividend Equivalent Account”) established for the Participant with respect to all RSUs granted hereunder with the same Vesting Date. All credits to a Dividend Equivalent Account for the Participant shall be notionally increased by the Account Rate (as hereinafter defined), compounded quarterly, from and after the applicable date of credit until paid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

The Committee may, in its discretion, deposit in the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Account the securities or property comprising any Property Distribution in lieu of crediting such Dividend Equivalent Account with the Fair Market Value thereof, or may otherwise adjust the terms of the Award as permitted under Section 5(b) of the Plan.

  


5.(a) Except as set forth in Sections 5(b) through 5(d) of this Agreement, all unvested RSUs provided for in this Agreement, all amounts credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs, and all securities and property comprising Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs shall immediately be forfeited on the date the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Individual (the “Termination Date”). 

  


(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Individual (the “Termination”) by reason of the Participant's death, Disability, or Retirement, the RSUs granted hereunder shall not be forfeited, and all such RSUs, all amounts credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs, and all securities and property comprising Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs shall remain outstanding and vest as of the date set forth in Section 2(a) provided the condition set forth in Section 6(b), but not Section 6(a), of this Agreement has been met. 

  


(c)Unless Section 5(d) applies, in the event that the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Individual by reason of the Participant's Termination by his employer or principal without Cause, and provided the conditions of Section 6(a) and 6(b) of this Agreement have been

met as of the Participant's Termination Date, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that the RSUs granted hereunder, all amounts credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs, and all securities and property comprising Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs shall vest as of the Participant's Termination Date. 

  


(d)If there has been a Change in Control of the Company, and within one year following the date of such Change in Control the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Individual by reason of the Participant's Termination by his employer or principal without Cause or Participant's termination of employment with Good Reason, then the RSUs granted hereunder shall not be forfeited, and all such RSUs, all amounts credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs, and all securities and property comprising Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs shall remain outstanding and vest as of the date set forth in Section 2(a) provided the conditions of Section 6(a) and 6(b) of this Agreement have been met. 

  


(e)In the event vesting is accelerated pursuant to this Section 5 and the Participant is a Key Employee, a distribution of Shares issuable to the Participant, all amounts notionally credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Account, and all securities and property comprising all Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account due the Participant upon the vesting of the RSUs shall not occur until six months after the Participant's Termination Date, unless the Participant's Termination is due to death or Disability.

  


6.(a) No RSU granted hereunder shall vest on the scheduled Vesting Date under Section 2(a) of this Agreement or as a result of the Participant's Termination pursuant to Section 5(c) of this Agreement unless the average of the Return on Investment for the five calendar years preceding the year in which such event occurs is at least 6%.

  


(b) Notwithstanding the Company' satisfaction of the condition in Section 6(a), if the Company's Total Shareholder Return is below the median of the Total Shareholder Return of the Peer Group, then 20% of the RSUs granted hereunder shall be forfeited. 

(c)  If required or deemed necessary to satisfy the requirements to qualify such RSU as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m), the appropriate members of the Committee shall certify prior to vesting the Company's achievement of the conditions in Sections 6(a) and 6(b). Any RSUs that do not vest as a result of the failure to meet the conditions of Sections 6(a) or 6(b), all amounts credited to the Participant's Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs, and all securities and property comprising Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Accounts with respect to such RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.
