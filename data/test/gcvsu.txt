(For Officers, Employees, and Other Key Persons)

  


Pursuant to the Rogers Corporation 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), Rogers Corporation (the “Company”) hereby grants to _______________________ (the “Employee” or the “Optionee”), a non-qualified stock option (the “Stock Option”) to purchase a maximum of __________ shares of capital stock of the Company (the “Capital Stock”) at the price of $ ________ per share, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Stock Option is granted as of __________________ (the “Grant Date”). 

1.

Timing of Exercise. Subject to Section 2 below, the Stock Option shall become exercisable as follows: if the Employee continues in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, as determined pursuant to the Plan, the Stock Option will become exercisable on the second anniversary of the Grant Date as to the first one-third of the shares subject to the Stock Option, on the third anniversary of the Grant Date as to the second one-third, and on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date as to the balance; except that upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) or for the reasons stated in Sections 2(a) or 2(b) below, the Stock Option shall become fully exercisable. The Stock Option shall remain exercisable until it expires on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, unless the Stock Option is sooner terminated as provided herein.   
  
2.

Termination of Stock Option. If the Employee’s employment by the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, other than death, Disability, or Retirement (as defined in the Plan and described below), the Stock Option may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable on the date of termination of employment, for a period of three (3) months from the date of termination of employment or the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, if earlier.   
  
a.

Termination by Reason of Death. If the Employee’s employment by the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of death, the Stock Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full and may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee’s beneficiary for a period of five (5) years from the date of death or until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, if earlier.   
  
b.

Termination by Reason of Disability or Retirement. If the Employee’s employment by the Company and its Subsidiaries has terminated by reason of Disability (as defined in the Plan), the Stock Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full and may thereafter be exercised for a period of five (5) years from the date of such termination of employment or until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, if earlier. If the Employee’s employment by the Company and its Subsidiaries has terminated by reason of Retirement (as defined in the Plan), the Stock Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full and may thereafter be exercised for a period of five (5) years from the date of such termination of employment or until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, if earlier.

3.

Manner of Exercise. The Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice of exercise to the Company, or the Company’s designee, specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price may be made by one or more of the following methods:   
  
a.

In cash, by check or other instrument acceptable to the Company;   
  
b.

In the form of shares of Capital Stock (either actually or by attestation) that the Employee has beneficially owned for more than six months and that are not then subject to restrictions under any Company plan. Such surrendered or attested shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) on the exercise date; or   
  
c.

Delivery by a broker of cash, check or other instrument payable and acceptable to the Company to pay the Stock Option purchase price; provided that in the event the Employee chooses to pay the Stock Option purchase price as so provided, the Employee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and such other agreements as the Company shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure.   
  
  


Payment instruments will be received subject to collection.  
  
Ownership of shares of Capital Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option will be contingent upon receipt by the Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Plan, this Agreement and applicable provisions of law. In the event the Employee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Capital Stock through the attestation method, only the net amount of shares shall be issued.   
  
4.

Stock Option Transferable in Limited Circumstances. The Stock Option may be transferred to a family member, trust or charitable organization to the extent permitted by applicable law; provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and the Plan. Except as permitted in the preceding sentence, the Stock Option is not transferable otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the Employee’s lifetime only by the Employee.   
  
5.

Stock Option Shares. The shares to be issued under the Plan are shares of the Capital Stock of the Company as constituted as of the date of this Agreement, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b) of the Plan.   
  
6.

Rights as a Stockholder. The Employee shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to shares of Capital Stock acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option and not as to any shares of Capital Stock covered by unexercised Stock Options. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are acquired.   
  
7.

Tax Withholding. The Optionee hereby agrees that the exercise of this Stock Option or any installment thereof will not be effective, and no shares will become transferable to the Optionee, until the Optionee makes appropriate arrangements with the Company for such income and employment tax withholding as may be required of the Company under applicable United States federal, state or local law on account of such exercise. The Optionee may satisfy the obligation(s), in whole or in part, by electing (i) to make a payment to the Company in cash, by check or by other instrument acceptable to the Company, (ii) subject to the general or specific approval of the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"), to deliver to the Company a number of already-owned shares of Capital Stock having a value not greater than the amount required to be withheld (such number may be rounded up to the next whole share), or (iii) by any combination of (i) and (ii) and/or the procedures described in the following sentence. The Committee may also permit, in its sole discretion and in accordance with such procedures as it deems appropriate, the Optionee to have the Company withhold a number of shares which would otherwise be issued pursuant to this Stock Option having a value not greater than the amount required to be withheld (such number may be rounded up to the next whole share). The value of shares to be withheld or delivered (if permitted by the Committee) shall be based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.

Purchase Only for Investment.
