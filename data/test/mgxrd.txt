In addition, Executive will be eligible (a) for an annual bonus under the Company’s annual incentive plan, with a target annual bonus initially established at 75-150% of base salary; (b) to participate in long-term cash and equity incentive plans and programs, if available, applicable generally to executives of the Company, and (c) to participate in welfare benefit and fringe benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company, if available.

If after the Effective Date (a)(i) the Company terminates Executive’s employment other than for Cause or (ii) Executive terminates his or her employment for Good Reason (within six months after such Good Reason event occurs) and (b) a Change in Control has not occurred, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum payment equal to the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination (the “Not for Cause Separation Payment”), contingent upon the Executive executing and returning to the Company (and not revoking) a general release of claims against the Company in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto (a “Release”), which Release must be delivered to the Company and the period in which it may be revoked must have expired not later than thirty 30 days after the date of termination (the “Release Deadline”).

3.2 Change in Control Separation Pay. If (a)(i) the Company terminates Executive’s employment other than for Cause or (ii) Executive terminates his or her employment for Good Reason (within six months after such Good Reason event occurs) and (b) a Change in Control has occurred within the 24-month period preceding the effective date of termination, the Company shall pay to the Executive, in lieu of the payments and benefits described in Section 3.1, a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination and (ii) the Executive’s target annual bonus for the year in which the date of termination occurs (the “Change in Control Separation Payment”), contingent upon the Executive executing and returning to the Company (and not revoking) a Release, which Release must be delivered to the Company and the period in which it may be revoked must have expired not later than the Release Deadline. Except as provided in Section 3.3, the Change in Control Separation Payment shall be payable (if the conditions of this Section 3.2 are satisfied) in a lump sum on the fifth business day following the Release Deadline. In addition, if the Change in Control Separation Payment becomes payable as provided herein, and unless otherwise agreed to by the Executive, any service-based vesting conditions on any outstanding long-term incentive awards held by Executive will be waived on the fifth business day following the Release Deadline.

3.3 Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, if the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A (“409A”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) when the termination occurs, amounts and benefits that are deferred compensation (within the meaning of 409A) that would otherwise be payable or provided under Section 3 during the six-month period immediately following the date of termination shall instead be paid, with interest on any delayed payment at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code, on the first business day after the earlier of (a) the date of the Executive’s death and (b) the date that is six months following the date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the parties hereto acknowledge that the severance payments and benefits described in this Agreement are intended to be exempt from and/or not considered “deferred compensation” under 409A, (y) with respect to any payments or benefits that are nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of 409A, any reference to “termination of employment” within the meaning of this Section 3 means a “separation for service” under 409A and (z) each payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of 409A.
