(g) Employee acknowledges that the Company’s remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this Section 6 is and will be insufficient and inadequate and that the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief, including by way of temporary and permanent injunction, in addition to any remedies the Company may have at law. 

(h) The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive termination of this Agreement. 

(i) The representations and covenants contained in this Section 6 on the part of the Employee will be construed as ancillary to and independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Employee against the Company or any of the other Related Parties or any officer, director or shareholder of the Company or any of the other Related Parties, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the covenants of the Employee contained in this Section 6. In addition, the provisions of this Section 6 shall continue to be binding upon the Employee in accordance with their terms, notwithstanding the termination of the Employee’s employment hereunder for any reason. 

(j) The parties to this Agreement agree that the limitations contained in this Section 6 with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable. However, if any court shall determine that the time, geographical area or scope of activity of any restriction contained in this Section 6 is unenforceable, it is the intention of the parties that such restrictive covenant set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable.

The provisions of this Section 7 shall continue in effect notwithstanding termination of the Employee’s employment hereunder for any reason. 

8\. Divisibility of Agreement. If any term, condition or provision of this Agreement is for any reason rendered void, all remaining terms, conditions and provisions shall remain and continue as valid and enforceable obligations of the parties hereto.
