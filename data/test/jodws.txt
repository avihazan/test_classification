Vesting Commencement Date:  
  
Number of Shares of Restricted Stock:  
  
Vesting Schedule: The Restricted Stock Award shall vest on the third anniversary of the date hereof unless the Participant is not serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company on such date unless the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, elects to accelerate the vesting of such Restricted Stock Award upon the resignation, removal, death or disability of such Participant.

II. Agreement

Section 1. Grant of Restricted Stock.

1.1 Number of Shares/Vesting. As set forth in Section I above, the Company has granted the Participant a Restricted Stock Award under the Plan subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. The number of shares of Restricted Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award may be adjusted from time to time for capitalization adjustments, as provided in Section 22 of the Plan. Subject to the limitations contained herein, the Restricted Stock Award will vest as provided in Section I above, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of the Participant’s service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, except as otherwise provided in Section I above or the Plan. The unvested portion of the Participant’s Restricted Stock Award, after giving effect to the vesting schedule provided in Section I above, will be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled by the Company immediately upon the termination of the Participant’s service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

1.2 Additional Documents. The Participant agrees to execute such additional documents and complete and execute such forms as the Company may require for purposes of this Agreement. In particular, as a condition of this Restricted Stock Award, the Participant shall delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered by this Restricted Stock Award in the form attached to this Agreement.

1.3 Defined Terms. Any defined terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan.

1.4 Issuance of Restricted Stock; Dividend and Distribution Rights. Prior to the vesting of any Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall cause certificates evidencing such Common Stock to be held in the custody of an officer or agent of the Company. Such certificates shall bear the following legend:

THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORFEITURE PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS AGAINST TRANSFER) CONTAINED IN THE NOVA ENERGY HOLDING, INC. 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AND A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND THE ISSUER. RELEASE FROM SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS SHALL BE OBTAINED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN AND AGREEMENT, A COPY OF EACH OF WHICH IS ON FILE IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE ISSUER.

Upon the vesting of any Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, the restrictions of Sections 1 and 2 shall lapse with respect to such vested Restricted Stock. As soon as practicable following the vesting of any Restricted Stock, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Participant a certificate evidencing such Common Stock (less any shares of Common Stock withheld under Section 4 below), free of any restrictive legends to the extent permitted by law. Any dividends or other distributions paid by the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock shall be held in escrow until the Restricted Stock vests in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 2. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Plan, no unvested Restricted Stock shall be sold, exchanged, assigned, transferred, conveyed, gifted, delivered, encumbered, discounted, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law. Immediately upon any attempt to transfer such rights, such Restricted Stock, and all of the rights related thereto, shall be forfeited by the Participant and cancelled by the Company.

Section 3. Notification of Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code. If the Participant shall, in connection with the grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement, make the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), (i.e., an election to include in gross income in the year of transfer the amounts specified in Section 83(b) of the Code), then the Participant must make such an election using a form provided by the Company. The election must be received by the Internal Revenue Service within 30 calendar days following the Date of Grant. The Participant shall also provide the Company with a copy of such election

within 10 calendar days of filing a notice of election with the Internal Revenue Service and shall, at the same time as such notice of election is provided to the Company, remit to the Company in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy any tax withholding obligations.

Section 4. Withholding. The Participant, as an independent contractor, will be responsible for payment of all withholding taxes relating to the Restricted Stock. If at any time the Company or any of its subsidiaries is required to withhold tax on account of any Restricted Stock, the Company or its subsidiary will require Participant to pay such withholding to the Company or its subsidiary in cash upon demand. The Company shall have a security interest in the Restricted Stock to secure the Participant’s obligation to pay withholding taxes. It is expressly understood that the Participant has acted as an independent contractor for the Company, and, accordingly, will receive a Form 1099 regarding the fair market value of the Restricted Stock as of the Effective Date.

Section 5. No Right to Continue Employment or Service. Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan, or Section I above shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Restricted Stock Award was granted or shall affect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate (i) the Participant’s employment, if the Participant is an employee, with or without notice and with or without cause, (ii) the Participant’s service as a consultant or adviser, if the Participant is a consultant or adviser, pursuant to the terms of the Participant’s agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate or (iii) the Participant’s service as a director, if the Participant is a director, pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.

Section 6. Rights as a Stockholder. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement.

Section 7. Notice. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) one business day following confirmed facsimile transmission, (b) three business days after being delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) one business day after being sent via overnight delivery service, as follows:
