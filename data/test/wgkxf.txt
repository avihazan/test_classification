THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of the Grant Date specified above, is entered into by and between Roundy’s, Inc., a corporation organized in the State of Delaware (the “Company”), and the Participant specified above, pursuant to the Roundy’s, Inc. 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan, as in effect and as amended from time to time (the “Plan”), which is administered by the Committee; and 

WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in the best interests of the Company to grant the shares of Restricted Stock provided herein to the Participant and for the Participant to become subject to the Director Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement (the “Covenants Agreement”) attached hereto as Exhibit A. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows: 

1\. Incorporation By Reference; Plan Document Receipt. This Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly intended not to apply to the Award provided hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part of and incorporated in this Agreement as if they were each expressly set forth herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as is ascribed thereto in the Plan. The Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a true copy of the Plan and that the Participant has read the Plan carefully and fully understands its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. 

2\. Grant of Restricted Stock Award. The Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of the Grant Date specified above, the number of shares of Restricted Stock specified above. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan, the Participant agrees and understands that nothing contained in this Agreement provides, or is intended to provide, the Participant with any protection against potential future dilution of the Participant’s interest in the Company for any reason, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such shares, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement. Subject to Section 5 hereof, the Participant shall not have the rights of a stockholder in respect of the shares underlying this Award until such shares are delivered to the Participant in accordance with Section 4 hereof. 

* * *

3\. Vesting of Stock.

(a) Vesting. The Restricted Stock subject to this grant shall become unrestricted and vested as of the first anniversary of the Grant Date, provided that the Participant has not incurred a Termination prior to each such vesting date. 

(b) Committee Discretion to Accelerate Vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock at any time and for any reason. 

(c) Change in Control. The Restricted Stock shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change in Control so long as the Participant has not incurred a Termination prior to such Change in Control. 

(d) Forfeiture. Subject to the Committee’s discretion to accelerate vesting hereunder, all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be immediately forfeited upon the Participant’s Termination for any reason. In the event that the Participant does not execute the Covenants Agreement or materially violates any material provision contained therein, the Restricted Stock shall be immediately forfeited and the Participant shall have no further rights under this Agreement. 

4\. Period of Restriction; Delivery of Unrestricted Shares. During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock shall bear a legend as described in Section 8.2(c) of the Plan. When shares of Restricted Stock awarded by this Agreement become vested, the Participant shall be entitled to receive unrestricted shares and if the Participant’s stock certificates contain legends restricting the transfer of such shares, the Participant shall be entitled to receive new stock certificates free of such legends (except any legends requiring compliance with securities laws). 

5\. Dividends and Other Distributions; Voting. Participants holding Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares, provided that any such dividends or other distributions will be subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying Restricted Stock and shall be paid at the time the Restricted Stock becomes vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof. If any dividends or distributions are paid in shares, the shares shall be deposited with the Company and shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. The Participant may exercise full voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock granted hereunder. 

6\. Non-Transferability. The shares of Restricted Stock, and any rights and interests with respect thereto, issued under this Agreement and the Plan shall not, prior to vesting, be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant (or any beneficiary of the Participant), other than by testamentary disposition by the Participant or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempt to sell, exchange, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate in any way any of the Restricted Stock, or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar legal process upon the Restricted Stock, contrary to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and/or the Plan shall be null and void and without legal force or effect.

7\. Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. 

8\. Withholding of Tax. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require the Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, local and foreign taxes of any kind (including, but not limited to, the Participant’s FICA and SDI obligations) which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to be withheld or remitted to comply with the Code and/or any other applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to the Restricted Stock and, if the Participant fails to do so, the Company may otherwise refuse to issue or transfer any shares of Common Stock otherwise required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement. 

9\. Section 83(b). If the Participant properly elects (as required by Section 83(b) of the Code) within 30 days after the issuance of the Restricted Stock to include in gross income for federal income tax purposes in the year of issuance the Fair Market Value of such shares of Restricted Stock, the Participant shall pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to pay to the Company upon such election, any federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock. If the Participant shall fail to make such payment, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock, as well as the rights set forth in Section 8 hereof. The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant’s sole responsibility, and not the Company’s, to file timely and properly the election under Section 83(b) of the Code and any corresponding provisions of state tax laws if the Participant elects to make such election, and the Participant agrees to timely provide the Company with a copy of any such election. 

10\. Legend. All certificates representing the Restricted Stock shall have endorsed thereon the legend set forth in Section 8.2(c) of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be obligated to deliver to the Participant a certificate representing the Restricted Stock prior to the vesting dates set forth above. 

11\. Securities Representations. The shares of Restricted Stock are being issued to the Participant and this Agreement is being made by the Company in reliance upon the following express representations and warranties of the Participant. The Participant acknowledges, represents and warrants that:

(b) If the Participant is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the shares of Restricted Stock must be held indefinitely unless an exemption from any applicable resale restrictions is available or the Company files an additional registration statement (or a “re-offer prospectus”) with regard to the shares of Restricted Stock and the Company is under no obligation to register the shares of Restricted Stock (or to file a “re-offer prospectus”). 

(c) If the Participant is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the Participant understands that (i) the exemption from registration under Rule 144 will not be available unless (A) a public trading market then exists for the Common Stock of the Company, (B) adequate information concerning the Company is then available to the public, and (C) other terms and conditions of Rule 144 or any exemption therefrom are complied with, and (ii) any sale of the shares of vested Restricted Stock hereunder may be made only in limited amounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of Rule 144 or any exemption therefrom.

EXHIBIT A 

FORM OF DIRECTOR CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT 

ROUNDY’S, INC. 

DIRECTOR CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT 

This Director Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the day of , 201__, by the undersigned for the benefit of Roundy’s, Inc. (“Roundy’s”) and its current and future Subsidiaries and Affiliates (as hereinafter defined). Roundy’s and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates are referred to herein collectively as the “Company.” 

PREAMBLE: 

I am a director of the Company. I understand that in the course of my service to the Company, I will have access to and become acquainted with a great deal of confidential, proprietary information concerning the Company's business, products, services, customers, sales and marketing efforts and practices, financial information, market strategies, corporate strategies, capital structure, ownership, and other valuable proprietary information. Some or all of such information may constitute "trade secrets" of the Company within the meaning of the Wisconsin Trade Secrets Act, Wis. Stat. §134.90. 

I understand that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and its disclosure to third persons could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's competitive position and business. Further, my use of such knowledge and information, and of the experience I have and will gain in the course of my service to the Company, in a manner competitive with the Company's business would have a substantial detrimental effect on the business and the value of the Company. The Company therefore wishes to maintain the strictest confidentiality of all such information and to take all reasonable steps to prevent its unauthorized dissemination or its use in a manner competitive with the Company's business, and to prohibit me from competing with the Company during the time I am serving as a director of the Company. 

The Company has offered to grant me Restricted Stock pursuant to the Company’s parent corporation, Roundy’s, Inc. (the “Restricted Stock”). I understand that the Company’s willingness to grant the Restricted Stock is in consideration, in part, of my entering into this Agreement. 

AGREEMENT: 

Therefore, in consideration of these circumstances, my continued directorship with the Company, and Company’s granting me the Restricted Stock, I agree as follows: 

6 

* * *

1\. Confidential Information. 

(a) I acknowledge that by reason of my duties to and association with the Company, I have had and will have access to and have and will become informed of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all information of a confidential or proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as “confidential”), in any form or medium, that is or was disclosed to, or developed or learned by, me in connection with my relationship with the Company or any of its stockholders or investors prior to the date hereof or during the continuation of my serving as a director of the Company, and that relates to the actual or anticipated business, products, services, financing, research or development of the Company or any of its stockholders or investors or their respective suppliers, distributors or customers. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) internal business information (including information relating to strategic and staffing plans and practices, business, training, marketing, promotional and sales plans and practices, cost, rate and pricing structures, accounting and business methods); (ii) identities of, individual requirements of, specific contractual arrangements with, information about and confidential and proprietary information of any of the Company’s suppliers, distributors and customers; (iii) trade secrets, compilations of data and analyses, techniques, systems, formulae, research, records, reports, manuals, documentation, models, data and data bases relating thereto; (iv) inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports and all similar or related information (whether or not patentable); and (v) Acquisition Targets and Active Targets (as defined below). Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or breach of obligation of confidentiality; (b) was rightfully received by me from a third party (other than the Company or any of the Company’s suppliers, distributors or customers) without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality by such third party known to me or (c) was known to me prior to the beginning of my service as a director of the Company. 

(b) During the term of my service as a director of the Company, I agree to keep in strict confidence and not, directly or indirectly, make known, disclose, furnish, make available or use any Confidential Information, except for use in my regular authorized duties on behalf of the Company. Following the termination (for any reason whatsoever) of directorship with the Company, I agree to keep in strict confidence and not, directly or indirectly, make known, disclose, furnish, make available or use any Confidential Information in the Geographic Area (as defined below). I acknowledge and agree that all documents and other property including or reflecting Confidential Information furnished to me by the Company or any of its shareholders, or investors or otherwise acquired or developed by me or known by me shall at all times be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. During my service as a director of the Company and thereafter, I will take all necessary and appropriate steps to safeguard Confidential Information and protect it against disclosure, misappropriation, misuse, loss and theft. I will deliver to the Company at the termination of my directorship, or at any other time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer disks or tapes, printouts and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to or containing any Confidential Information, Work Product (as defined below) or the business of the Company or any of its shareholders or investors which I may then possess or have under my control and shall erase all embodiments of the Confidential Information from all storage devices. If I am required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law or court order, I will provide the Company with prior written notice of the requirement for disclosure that details the Confidential Information to be disclosed and will cooperate with the Company to preserve the confidentiality of such information to the extent possible. 

2\. Common Law of Torts or Trade Secrets. In addition to the Company’s rights and my duties as specifically set out in this Agreement, the Company will retain all such rights, and I will be bound by all such duties, to protect the Company’s Confidential Information, as are or may be provided under the law, including without limitation the Wisconsin Trade Secrets Act (Wis. Stat. §134.90). Nothing herein will diminish the Company’s common law and statutory rights to: 

7 

* * *

(a) keep such information secret for as long as the law allows; 

(b) protect such information from disclosure to any third party, wherever located; 

(c) protect such information from use by any person, including me, not authorized by the Company; and 

(d) seek any remedies and take any measures necessary to protect the Company’s Confidential Information. 

3\. Inventions and Patents. 

(a) I acknowledge that all Work Product is the exclusive property of the Company. I hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to all Work Product to the Company. Any copyrightable works that fall within Work Product will be deemed “works made for hire” under Section 201(b) of the 1976 Copyright Act, and the Company shall own all of the rights comprised in the copyright therein; provided, however, that to the extent such works may not, by operation of law, constitute “works made for hire,” I hereby assign to the Company all right, title and interest therein. 

(b) I will promptly and fully disclose all Work Product to the Company and will cooperate and perform at the expense of the Company all actions reasonably requested by the Company (whether during or after my service as a director of the Company) to establish, confirm and protect the Company’s right, title and interest in such Work Product. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I agree to assist the Company, at the Company’s expense, to secure its rights in the Work Product in any and all countries, including the execution of all applications and all other instruments and documents which the Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain rights in such Work Product and in order to assign and convey to the Company the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Work Product. If the Company is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason (including my refusal to do so after request therefor is made by the Company) to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Work Product belonging to or assigned to the Company pursuant to Section 3(a) above, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Roundy’s and each of its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patents or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. I agree not to apply for or pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering any Work Product other than pursuant to this paragraph in circumstances where such patents or copyright registrations are or have been or are required to be assigned to the Company. 

4\. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Interference. 

(a) I agree that, during my service as a director of the Company, I will not directly or indirectly own any interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as an officer, director, employee, partner, agent, representative or otherwise), consult with, render services for, or in any other manner engage in any business which is, directly or indirectly, engaged in any business in which the Company engages or proposes to engage during the period of my service as a director of the Company. 

8 

* * *

(b) Nothing herein shall prohibit me from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding securities of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as I have no active participation in the business of any such corporation. 

(c) During my service as a director of the Company and throughout the Nonsolicitation Period, I will not directly or indirectly (including through another person) solicit or attempt to solicit, induce or attempt to induce any employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or any other person otherwise engaged in a services or business relationship (including, without limitation, any customer, supplier, licensee or licensor) with the Company to leave the employ of or terminate or otherwise adversely alter such person’s relationship with the Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company and any such person; provided, however, I will not be prohibited from engaging the services of any such person who is also engaged by the Company (other than any employee of the Company, or any consultant or agent providing services substantially on a full-time basis to the Company relating primarily to the Food Industries, as that term is defined below) so long as any such engagement would not otherwise constitute a breach of this Section 4(d). 

(d) During the Nonsolicitation Period, I will not directly or indirectly (including through another person) hire or otherwise engage the services of any person who was an employee of the Company at any time during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the termination of my directorship with the Company. 

(e) During my service as a director of the Company and throughout the Nonsolicitation Period, I will not directly or indirectly (including through another person) acquire or attempt to acquire any business in the United States of America to which the Company or any of its shareholders or investors has made any proposal during the Reference Period relating to the possible acquisition of such business by the Company or any of its shareholders or investors (an “Acquisition Target”), or take any action to induce or attempt to induce any Acquisition Target to consummate any acquisition, investment or other similar transaction with any person other than the Company or any of its shareholders or investors. 

(f) If, at the time of enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in Section 1, 2, 4(a), 4(c) or 4(d) of this Agreement, a court holds that the duration, scope, or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, I agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court will be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. Because my services are unique and because I have access to Confidential Information and Work Product, I agree that monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or similar relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof. In addition, in the event of a breach or violation by me of any covenant or agreement in Section 4(a), 4(b), 4(d) or 4(e), the Noncompete Period set forth in such Section with respect to such covenant or agreement shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly cured.
