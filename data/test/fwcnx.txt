The Executive acknowledges that he has established, and will continue to establish, favorable relations with the customers, clients and accounts of the Company, and will have access to trade secrets and other proprietary information of the Company. Therefore, in consideration of such relations and access and the entering into of this Agreement by the Company, and to further protect such trade secrets and proprietary information, the Executive agrees that at all times during his employment with the Company through the twelfth (12) month anniversary of the date of termination or expiration of the Executive’s employment, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written consent of the Chief Executive Officer:

  


(A) own or have any interest in, or act as an officer, director, partner, principal, employee, agent, representative, consultant or independent contractor of, or in any way assist in, any business which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive with the Company in those markets and/or product lines and within those jurisdictions in which the Company competes at any time during the Term, or become associated with or render services to any person, firm, corporation or other entity so engaged (“Competitive Businesses”); provided, however, that the Executive may own without the express written consent of the Company not more than two percent (2%) of the issued and outstanding securities of any company or enterprise whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded in the over the counter market; 

  


(B) solicit clients, customers or accounts of the Company for, on behalf of, or otherwise related to, any such Competitive Businesses or any products related thereto; or

(C) solicit any person who is, or shall be, in the employ or service of the Company to leave such employ or service for employment with the Executive or an affiliate of the Executive.

  


Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the covenant not to compete, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic area or scope covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration, area or scope of such provision to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.

As a condition to reimbursement under this Section 3.6, the Executive shall furnish to the Company adequate records and other documentary evidence required by federal and state statutes and regulations for the substantiation of each expenditure. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that failure to furnish the required documentation may result in the Company denying all or part of the expense for which reimbursement is sought.

  


3.7 Restricted Stock Unit Grant.
