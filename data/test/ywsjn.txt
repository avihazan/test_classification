5\. Exercisability of the Option. 

(a) General. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, the Option shall become vested and exercisable in five equal installments on the day prior to each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Date of Grant (i.e., the vesting dates shall be March 14 of 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively) provided that the Executive remains employed with the Company on each such date, such that one hundred percent (100%) of the Option shall be vested and exercisable on the day prior to the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant.

Upon the Executive’s cessation of employment with the Company or any Affiliate of the Parent for any reason, any then remaining portion of the Unvested Option shall be immediately terminated without the receipt of consideration by the Executive, as more fully set out below, except as set out in clauses (iv) and (v) below:

(ii) Termination without Cause or for Good Reason. Except as provided in Section 5(b)(v) below, upon the Executive’s cessation of employment with the Company or any Affiliate of the Parent due to a termination without Cause or for Good Reason, any then remaining portion of the Unvested Option shall be immediately terminated without the receipt of consideration by the Executive. 

(iii) Voluntary Termination without Good Reason.

(iv) Termination Due to Death or Disability. In the event of the Executive’s cessation of employment with the Company or any Affiliate of the Parent by reason of the Executive’s death or Disability, the additional portion, if any, of the Option that would have become vested and exercisable if the Executive had remained employed by the Company for 12 months following such termination date will become immediately vested and exercisable as of such termination date.

(v) Termination without Cause or for Good Reason in Connection with a Change in Control. Upon the Executive’s cessation of employment with the Company or any Affiliate of the Parent due to a termination without Cause or for Good Reason, in each case, provided that such termination occurs on or after, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control, the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable. 

(c) The term “Vested Option,” as used herein, shall mean the portion of the Option on and following the time that the vesting condition set forth in Section 5(a) or 5(b) hereof has been satisfied as to such portion. The portion of the Option which has not become the Vested Option is hereinafter referred to as the “Unvested Option.” 

(d) The Option may be exercised only as to the Vested Option, and only by written notice using the applicable form provided by Parent delivered in person or by mail in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof and accompanied by payment therefor. The purchase price of the Option Shares shall be paid by the Executive to Parent (A) by certified check or wire transfer (using such wire transfer instructions as are provided by Parent or the Company), (B) by transferring to Parent shares of Common Stock, if and in the manner approved by Parent, (C) by a broker-assisted “cashless exercise” procedure if and in the manner approved by the Committee, or (D) by any other method approved in writing by the Committee. If requested by Parent, the Executive shall promptly deliver his copy of this Agreement evidencing the Option to the Secretary of Parent who shall endorse thereon a notation of such exercise and promptly return such Agreement to the Executive. Upon payment of the applicable purchase price and the issuance of the Option Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

(e) In the event that the Common Stock ceases to be traded on an Exchange following a transaction or other event that does not constitute a Change in Control, then, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, the Option shall be treated in the same manner as Parent and the Company treat stock options then held by the employees of the Company generally. 

6\. Exercise Period for Vested Option Following Termination of Employment on Option. 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive’s employment may be terminated (i) by the Company for Cause or by the employee in violation of any applicable employment agreement (a “6(a)(i) Termination”), (ii) by the Executive other than as a Retirement or for Good Reason and without any violation of any applicable employment agreement (a “6(a)(ii) Termination”), (iii) by the Company without Cause (including on account of Disability), or on account of the Executive’s death or by the Executive for Good Reason (a “6(a)(iii) Termination”) or (iv) by the Executive on account of Retirement (a “6(a)(iv) Termination”). For purposes of the preceding sentence, “Retirement” shall mean the Executive’s voluntary termination of employment with the Company on or after the age of 62, after no less than 10 years of employment with the Company.

8\. Transferability. Except as described in Section 12(k) of the Plan, the Option shall not be transferable by the Executive other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported transfer shall be void and unenforceable against Parent; provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute a transfer or encumbrance. 

9\. Rights as Stockholder.

Under this method, Merrill Lynch will sell some or all of the Shares immediately, with part of the proceeds being used to pay the exercise price, taxes and brokerage fees. The remaining proceeds (net of the exercise price, any withholding and brokerage commissions or other fees) will be paid to the option holder. 

Exercise with Cash Payment: 

¨ I have enclosed either one or more certified checks covering both the exercise price of $ and the required payroll taxes and income tax withholding of $ . (Please contact Trent Tappe to determine the amount of any required payroll taxes and income tax withholding.) 

If electing the cashless exercise form of payment above, this represents a sale of Shares. You will need to obtain any necessary pre-clearance required by Parent’s Insider Trading Policy prior to completing any such exercise. Additionally, any sale of Shares must comply with and will be subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. 

I hereby represent that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I am legally entitled to exercise this option.
