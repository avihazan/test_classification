4\. RESTRICTIONS ON UNVESTED SHARES; RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER; DIVIDENDS: You will have the right to receive dividends during the Restriction Period, to vote the Shares subject to the Award, and to enjoy all other stockholder rights, except that (a) you will not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate(s) representing unvested Shares (and distribution of dividends, if any, declared on unvested Shares) unless and until the Restriction Period with respect to the Shares expires and the Forfeiture Restrictions lapse (in which case delivery of the Shares will be made as soon as practicable and distribution of such dividends will be made no later than March 15th of the year following the year in which the corresponding portion of the Award vests); (b) the Company will (or will designate an agent or representative to) retain custody of the stock certificate(s) during the Restriction Period; (c) you may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the Shares during the Restriction Period; and (d) a breach of the terms and conditions applicable to the Award will cause a forfeiture of the Award and the underlying Shares subject to the Award. 

5\. SALES OF VESTED SHARES; NONTRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD: The sale of vested Shares may be further restricted due to applicable securities or other laws or pursuant to the Company’s policies, including but not limited to its Insider Trading Policy. The Award will not be transferable or assignable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution unless otherwise permitted under the terms of the Plan. 

6\. TAX LIABILITY: This Award is considered “taxable income” under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and, therefore carries with it an income tax liability. By accepting this Award, you agree to satisfy the income tax liability related to the Award and to the following terms and conditions: 

(a) If required by applicable law, the Company will withhold any local, state, federal, foreign and other taxes and any other amounts required to be withheld by any governmental authority or law from any amount payable with respect to the Award. Prior to the delivery or transfer of any certificate for the Shares or any other benefit, the Company will require you to pay to the Company in cash the amount of any tax or other amount required by any governmental authority to be withheld and paid over by the Company to such authority for the account of such recipient.  
(b) Within thirty (30) days of the Grant Date, you may file an “83(b) election” with the Internal Revenue Service to recognize as income 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the Grant Date. The 83(b) election should be sent via certified mail to the Internal Revenue Service. This election is generally irrevocable. You must also send a copy of the 83(b) election to the Company’s Human Resources Department in Berwyn, PA (Attention: Manager of Qualified Plans).  
(c) The Shares may also be subject to taxation when the stock is eventually sold, at which time you may recognize a capital gain or loss. It is your responsibility to consult a tax advisor to determine and establish implications associated with any grant, vest or sale. The Company has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Award or issuance or transfer of Shares pursuant to the Award. By accepting the Award, you acknowledge the following: (i) you are in no manner relying on the Company or its representatives for an assessment of such tax consequences; (ii) there may be adverse tax consequences upon the grant of the Award and the acquisition or disposition of the Shares subject to the Award and you have been advised that you should consult with your own attorney, accountant, and/or tax advisor regarding the decision to enter into this Agreement and the consequences thereof; and (iii) the Company has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.  
  
7\. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED SERVICE; FORFEITURE: Unless otherwise provided by contract, you or the Company may terminate your service at any time for any reason or for no reason. If your service terminates for any reason and all or any part of the Award has not vested, the Award, to the extent not then vested, will be forfeited immediately upon termination of service and you will have no further rights with respect to the Award or any unvested Shares or other benefit related to the Award.

21\. FORFEITURE OF SHARES AND/OR GAIN FROM SHARES:

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, at any time during the period of the Holder’s service with the Company or during the 24-month period following termination of the Holder’s service with the Company for any reason (regardless of whether such termination was by the Company or the Holder, and whether voluntary or involuntary), the Holder engages in a Prohibited Activity (as defined herein), then (i) the Award will immediately be terminated and forfeited in its entirety, (ii) any vested or unvested Shares that were granted pursuant to the Award will immediately be forfeited and returned to the Company and the Holder will cease to have any rights related thereto and will cease to be recognized as the legal owner of such Shares, and (iii) any Gain (as defined herein) realized by the Holder with respect to any Shares subject to the Award will immediately be paid by the Holder to the Company. 

(b) For the purposes herein, a “Prohibited Activity” means (i) the Holder’s solicitation or assisting any other person in so soliciting, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, of any customers, suppliers, vendors, or other service providers to or of the Company for the purpose of inducing that customer, supplier, vendor or other service provider to terminate or alter his or its relationship with the Company; (ii) the Holder’s inducement, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, of any employees or service providers to terminate their employment with or service to the Company for the purpose of performing services for, assisting, advising or otherwise supporting any business which is competitive with the business of the Company; (iii) the Holder’s violation of any noncompetition restrictions applicable to the Holder; (iv) the Holder’s violation of any of the Company’s policies, including, without limitation, the Company’s insider trading policies; (v) the Holder’s violation of any material (as determined by the Committee) federal, state or other law, rule or regulation; (vi) the Holder’s disclosure or misuse of any confidential information or material concerning the Company (except as otherwise required by law or as agreed to by the parties herein); (vii) the Holder’s dishonesty, theft or embezzlement in a manner that negatively impacts the Company in any way; (viii) the Holder’s refusal or failure to perform his agreed-upon duties for the Company in a satisfactory manner; or (ix) the Holder’s engaging in any conduct that could be materially damaging to the Company without a reasonable good faith belief that such conduct was in the best interest of the Company. The Committee (or its designee, to the extent permitted pursuant to the Plan) has sole and absolute discretion to determine if a Prohibited Activity has occurred. 

(c) For the purposes herein, “Gain” means, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the greater of the Fair Market Value of the Shares (or portion thereof) at the time of grant or vesting or the disposition price of such Shares at the time of disposition, multiplied by the number of Shares sold or disposed. 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 21 herein, the waiver by the Company in any one or more instances of any rights afforded to the Company pursuant to the terms of Section 21 herein will not be deemed to constitute a further or continuing waiver of any rights the Company may have pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Plan (including but not limited to the rights afforded the Company in Section 21 herein). 

(e) By accepting this Agreement, and without limiting the effect of Section 13 herein, the Holder consents to a deduction (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any amounts the Company may owe the Holder from time to time to the extent of the amounts the Holder owes the Company pursuant to this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 13 or Section 21 herein.
