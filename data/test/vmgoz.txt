(iii) the Executive fails to perform any material obligation set forth in this Agreement and such failure is not cured by the Executive within such reasonable time as may be necessary (not less than 30 days) after written notice to the Executive by the Company. 

Upon any termination for Cause, and subject to the provisions of Section 3(a) above, the Executive shall have no right to compensation, bonus, severance, or other reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, except that the Executive shall be entitled to all guaranteed compensation, and all stock options, restricted stock and other securities instruments and benefits that have accrued and/or vested as of the date of termination. 

(b) Death or Disability. This Agreement and the Company’s obligations hereunder will terminate upon the death or disability of the Executive. For purposes of this Section 5(b), “disability” shall mean that for a period of six (6) months in any twelve-month period, the Executive is incapable of substantially fulfilling the duties set forth in this Agreement because of physical, mental or emotional incapacity resulting from injury, sickness or disease as determined by an independent physician mutually acceptable to the Company and the Executive. Upon any termination of this Agreement due to death or disability, the Company will pay the Executive or his legal representative, as the case may be, his Base Salary (which may include any accrued but unused vacation time) at such time pursuant to Section 3(a) through the date of such termination of employment (or, if terminated as a result of a disability, until the date upon which the disability policy maintained pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) begins payment of benefits), plus any other compensation that may be due and unpaid. 

(c) Voluntary Termination. Prior to any other termination of this Agreement, the Executive may, on thirty (30) day’s prior written notice to the Company given at any time, terminate his employment with the Company.

(d) Termination without Cause. If the Company terminates the Executive’s employment for any reason other than “Cause” as defined in Section 5(a) above, and if Executive signs a release of claims in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, Executive shall be entitled to all of the consideration listed below in this paragraph. Executive shall be entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to one year of the Executive’s Base Salary.

All records, files, materials and confidential information (the “Confidential Information”) obtained by the Executive in the course of his employment with the Company shall be deemed confidential and proprietary and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, as the case may be. The Executive will not, except in connection with and as required by his performance of his duties under this Agreement, for any reason use for his own benefit or the benefit of any person or entity with which he may be associated, disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever without the prior consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, unless such information previously shall have become public knowledge through no action by or omission of the Executive. Confidential Information shall exclude Executive’s knowledge, expertise, know-how or business acumen, as well as his personal files whether developed or acquired prior to or during the Term. 

(c) Subversion, Disruption or Interference. At no time during the term of this Agreement shall the Executive, directly or indirectly, interfere, induce, influence, combine or conspire with, or attempt to induce, influence, combine or conspire with, any of the employees of, or consultants to, the Company to terminate their relationship with or compete with or ally against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in the business in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is then engaged in.

(iii) all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company is disposed of pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other transaction (unless the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they owned the voting power of the Company, all of the voting power or other ownership interests of the entity or entities, if any, that succeed to the business of the Company); 

(b) The Company and the Executive hereby agree that if the Executive is in the employ of the Company on the date on which a Change of Control occurs (the “Change of Control Date”), the Company will continue to employ the Executive and the Executive will remain in the employ of the Company for the period commencing on the Change of Control Date and ending on the expiration of the Term, to exercise such authority and perform such executive duties as are commensurate with the authority being exercised and duties being performed by the Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control Date. 

(c) During the remaining Term after the Change of Control Date, the Company will (i) continue to honor the terms of this Agreement, including the Base Salary and other compensation set forth in Section 3 above, (ii) continue employee benefits as set forth in Section 4 above at levels in effect on the Change of Control Date; and (iii) immediately vest and accrue all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other securities instruments as detailed in Section 3 above (all subject to such reductions as may be required to maintain such plans in compliance with applicable federal law regulating employee benefits in the wake of a change of control). 

(d) If during the remaining Term on or after the Change of Control Date there shall have occurred a material reduction in the Executive’s compensation or employment related benefits, a material change in the Executive’s status, working conditions or management responsibilities, or a material change in the business objectives or policies of the Company, and the Executive voluntarily terminates employment within ninety (90) days of any such occurrence, or the last in a series of occurrences, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive, subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below, a lump-sum cash payment equal to 299% of the Executive’s Base Salary in effect on the Change of Control Date, which payment shall be made on the date that is six months following the date of the termination or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
