§ 2  
  
Purchase price (put option)  
  
  


4

* * *

1.

As purchase price the seller shall receive an amount to the value of the part of the company value, within the meaning of clause 3, which corresponds to the share of the participating interest to be assigned as according to §1 Para. 5 relative to the total limited liability capital of Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG, for the total limited partner's share of 22 % held by the seller, but at least € 17,443,328 ("purchase price's lower limit") and at most € 31,443,328 ("purchase price' upper limit"). Should the sale take place pro-rata, then the purchase price’s lower limit and the purchase price’s upper limit shall be applicable corresponding to the amount of the assigned share.  
  
  


  


2.

The purchase price’s upper limit shall not apply if  
  
  


-

the purchase price according to Para. 1 exceeds the purchase price's upper limit by more than 17.5% and is based on the patents named in Annex 1 to this Agreement or those developed by the seller in the future, or  
  
  


-

the buyer resells the shares acquired from the seller at a higher price to a third person within twelve months of the assignment according to § 1 Para 5\. Applicable as purchase price’s upper limit then is the value corresponding to the purchase price obtained by the buyer.  
  
  


3.

The value of the Company is taken as ten times ("multiplied by a factor of ten") the average EBIT for Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG in keeping with paragraph 5, (i), minus the consolidated liabilities of Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG as defined in Enclosure 3.2 (B) of the sales an purchase agreement, at the time the assignment takes effect, exceeding the sum of €10,000,000 as well as (ii) increased by the liquid means (cash) as defined in the Enclosure 3.2 (C) of the sales and purchase agreement, and (iii) minus the further sum of €1,556,672. If the mean EBIT of Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG is less than €10,000,000, the factor of ten shall be replaced with a factor of nine.  
  
  


5

* * *

4.

The basis for the calculation of the value of the Company is the average EBIT for the two business years that ended before or on the key assignment date in accordance with § 1 Para. 5 (in the case of an assignment as at 30.9.2015, the balance sheets as at 30.9.2014 and 30.9.2015 shall form the basis, and for assignment as at 31.3.2011 the balance sheets for 30.9.2009 and 30.9.2010, whereby it is assumed that Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG changes its business year to the period 1.10 to 30.9 after the acquisition pursuant to § 1 Para. 2.  
  
  


5.

EBIT is the operative result from standard business operations shown in the consolidated financial statements for Saueressig GmbH & Co. KG pursuant to § 275 Para. 2 No. 14 German Commercial Code (HGB), plus interest and similar expenses pursuant to § 275 Para. 2 No. 13 HGB.  
  
  


6.

Should the assignment of the limited partner's share fall before 30.9.2013, the purchase price, except in the cases of § 1 Para. 4, amounts for the total limited partner's share of the seller (22% of the total limited liability capital), notwithstanding Para. 1, to € 14,826,829.  
  
  


7.

In addition to the purchase price, the seller shall receive an amount to the level of his money-drawing interest on its member loan accounts and private accounts at the time of the assignment according to § 1 Para. 5. Should the assignment take place as per § 1 Para 4 pro-rata, then the corresponding pro-rata credit balance is to be credited.  
  
  


8.

The purchase price and the payment according to Para. 7 shall be due on the day on which the assignment of the limited partner's share shall become effective (§ 1 Para. 5) and shall be payable to the value of purchase price's lower limit (Para. 1) or the fixed purchase price (Para. 6) with due date furthermore at the latest 3 months after due date but at the earliest with entry of the change in limited partner in the Commercial Register.  
  
  


9.

The purchase price and the payment according to Para. 7 is to be charged interest on from the day of due date of the purchase price at 2 percentage points above the base rate valid on due date of the European Central Bank or at an interest rate replacing this. The interest payments shall be due and payable with the purchase price.  
  
  


6

* * *

10.

If there is no agreement on the amount of the purchase price between the buyer and the seller at the latest up to when purchase price is payable, this shall be determined with binding effect for the parties by an audit company with international experience as an arbitrator. Should the parties not agree on an arbitrator, this person shall be determined by the Wirtschaftsprüfer e.V., Düsseldorf on request by the buyer or seller . The costs for the arbitrator and Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer e.V., Düsseldorf shall be borne by the buyer and the seller based on the ratio between the prevailing and the defeated. The arbitrator shall determine the purchase price when in doubt on the basis of the balancing methods used by the firm up to 2007.  
  
  


11.

Subsequent changes of the balance sheets which underlie the purchase price calculation - perhaps due to a tax audit - have no influence on the purchase price.
