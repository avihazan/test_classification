WHEREAS, Employee wishes to be so employed under the terms set forth herein;

10. TERMINATION. Employee and the Company each acknowledge that either party has the right to terminate Employee’s employment with the Company at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause or advance notice pursuant to the following:

(a) Termination by Death or Disability. Subject to applicable state or federal law, in the event Employee shall die during the period of his employment hereunder or become permanently disabled, as evidenced by notice to the Company and Employee’s inability to carry out his job responsibilities for a continuous period of more than three months, Employee’s employment and the Company’s obligation to make payments hereunder shall terminate on the date of his death, or the date upon which, in the sole determination of the Board of Directors, Employee has failed to carry out his job responsibilities for three months, except that the Company shall pay Employee’s estate any salary earned but unpaid prior to termination, all accrued but unused vacation and any business expenses that were incurred but not reimbursed as of the date of termination. Vesting of any unvested stock options and/or other equity securities shall cease on the date of termination.

(b) Voluntary Resignation by Employee. In the event Employee voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company (other than for Good Reason (as defined below)), the Company’s obligation to make payments hereunder shall cease upon such termination, except that the Company shall pay Employee any salary earned but unpaid prior to termination, all accrued but unused vacation and any business expenses that were incurred but not reimbursed as of the date of termination. Vesting of any unvested stock options and/or other equity securities shall cease on the date of termination.

(c) Termination for Just Cause. In the event the Employee is terminated by the Company for Just Cause (as defined below), the Company’s obligation to make payments hereunder shall cease upon the date of receipt by Employee of written notice of such termination (the “date of termination” for purposes of this paragraph 10(c)), except that the Company shall pay Employee any salary earned but unpaid prior to termination, all accrued but unused vacation and any business expenses that were incurred but not reimbursed as of the date of termination. Vesting of any unvested stock options and/or other equity securities shall cease on the date of termination.

(d) Termination by the Company without Just Cause Or Resignation for Good Reason (Other Than Change in Control). The Company shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment with the Company at any time without Just Cause. In the event Employee is terminated by the Company without Just Cause or Employee resigns for Good Reason (other than in connection with a Change in Control (as defined below)), and upon the execution of a full general release by Employee (“Release”, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A), releasing all claims known or unknown that Employee may have against the Company as of the date Employee signs such release, and upon the written acknowledgment of his continuing obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, Employee shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits: (i) continuation of Employee’s base salary, then in effect, for a period of six (6) months following the Termination Date, paid on the same basis and at the same time as previously paid; (ii) payment of any accrued but unused vacation and sick leave; and (iii) the Company shall pay the premiums of Employee’s group health insurance COBRA continuation coverage, including coverage for Employee’s eligible dependents, for a 

3

* * *

  


maximum period of six (6) months following a termination without Just Cause or resignation for Good Reason; provided, however, that (a) the Company shall pay premiums for Employee’s eligible dependents only for coverage for which those eligible dependents were enrolled immediately prior to the termination without Just Cause or resignation for Good Reason and (b) the Company’s obligation to pay such premiums shall cease immediately upon Employee’s eligibility for comparable group health insurance provided by a new employer of Employee. Vesting of any unvested stock options and/or other equity securities shall cease on the date of termination.

(e) Change in Control Severance Benefits. In the event that the Company (or any surviving or acquiring corporation) terminates Employee’s employment without Just Cause or Employee resigns for Good Reason within one (1) month prior to or twelve (12) months following the effective date of a Change in Control (“Change in Control Termination”), and upon the execution of a Release, Employee shall be entitled to receive the following Change in Control severance benefits: (i) a lump-sum cash payment in an amount equal to (A) Employee’s annual base salary then in effect, plus (B) the greater of (1) Employee’s annualized target bonus award for the year in which Employee’s employment terminates or (2) the Annual Bonus amount paid to Employee in the immediately preceding year; (ii) payment of any accrued but unused vacation and sick leave; (iii) payment of Employee’s target bonus award for the year in which Employee’s employment terminates, prorated through the date of the Change in Control Termination; (iv) the Company (or any surviving or acquiring corporation) shall pay the premiums of Employee’s group health insurance COBRA continuation coverage, including coverage for Employee’s eligible dependents, for a maximum period of twelve (12) months following a Change in Control Termination; and (v) the Company (or any surviving or acquiring corporation) shall pay the costs of outplacement assistance services from an outplacement agency selected by Employee for a period of six (6) months following a Change in Control Termination, up to maximum of $7,500 in aggregate; provided, however, that (a) the Company (or any surviving or acquiring corporation) shall pay premiums for Employee’s eligible dependents only for coverage for which those eligible dependents were enrolled immediately prior to the Change in Control Termination and (b) the Company’s (or any surviving or acquiring corporation’s) obligation to pay such premiums shall cease immediately upon Employee’s eligibility for comparable group health insurance provided by a new employer of Employee. Employee agrees that the Company’s (or any surviving or acquiring corporation’s) payment of health insurance premiums will satisfy its obligations under COBRA for the period provided. No insurance premium payments will be made following the effective date of Employee’s coverage by a health insurance plan of a subsequent employer. For the balance of the period that Employee is entitled to coverage under federal COBRA law, if any, Employee shall be entitled to maintain such coverage at Employee’s own expense.

In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in Employee’s stock option or other equity award agreements to the contrary, in the event the Company (or any surviving or acquiring corporation) terminates Employee’s employment without Just Cause or Employee resigns for Good Reason within one (1) month prior to or twelve (12) months following the effective date of a Change in Control, and any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation assumes Employee’s stock options and/or equity awards, as applicable, or substitutes similar stock options or equity awards for Employee’s stock options and/or equity awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Company’s equity incentive plans, then (i) the vesting of all of Employee’s 

4

* * *

  


stock options and/or equity awards (or any substitute stock options or equity awards), as applicable, shall be accelerated in full and (ii) the term and the period during which Employee’s stock options may be exercised shall be extended to twelve (12) months after the date of Employee’s termination of employment; provided, that, in no event shall such options be exercisable after the expiration date of such options as set forth in the stock option grant notice and/or agreement evidencing such options.

(f) Legal Costs. In the event Employee institutes and prevails in litigation regarding the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any material provision of this Section 10 or any guarantee of performance thereof, the Employee shall be entitled to payment of his reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses by the Company.
