Exhibit 10.2



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) made as of this ___ day of October, 2009 among Enterprise Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Buyer” or “Enterprise”), the signatory on the execution page hereof (“Seller”) and solely for the purposes of Sections 4(d), 7 and 8(a) hereof, Marc H. Bell (“Bell”) and Daniel C. Staton (“Staton” and together with Bell, the “Insiders”) and solely for the purposes of Sections 8(a) and 8(b) hereof, ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (“ARMOUR”).

WHEREAS, Buyer was organized for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination, an operating business (“Business Combination”); and

WHEREAS, Buyer consummated an initial public offering in November 2007 (“IPO”) in connection with which it raised gross proceeds of approximately $250 million, a significant portion of which was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (“Continental”) pending the consummation of a Business Combination, or the dissolution and liquidation of Buyer in the event it is unable to consummate a Business Combination on or prior to November 7, 2009; and

WHEREAS, Buyer has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 29, 2009, among Enterprise, ARMOUR, and ARMOUR Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub Corp.”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARMOUR (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub Corp. will merge with and into Enterprise with Enterprise surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARMOUR and (ii) holders of Enterprise securities at the time of merger will be security holders of ARMOUR (the “Merger”); and

WHEREAS, the approval of the Merger is contingent upon, among other things, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares of Enterprise which are present and entitled to vote at the special meeting called to approve the Merger; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to certain provisions in Buyer’s certificate of incorporation, a holder of shares of Buyer’s common stock issued in the IPO may, if it votes against the Merger, demand that Buyer convert such common shares into cash (“Conversion Rights”); and

WHEREAS, the Merger cannot be consummated if holders of 30% (or 50% in the event the secondary charter proposal is approved at the Enterprise special meeting of stockholders to vote upon the Merger) or more of Enterprise common stock issued in the IPO exercise their Conversion Rights; and

WHEREAS, Seller has agreed to sell to Buyer and Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller the common shares set forth on the execution page of this Agreement (“Shares”) for the purchase price per share set forth therein (“Purchase Price Per Share”) and for the aggregate purchase price set forth therein (“Aggregate Purchase Price”) plus the fees set forth therein (the “Fees”).

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.

Purchase. Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer hereby agrees to (i) purchase from Seller at the Closing (as defined in Section 4(c)) the Shares at the Purchase Price Per Share, for the Aggregate Purchase Price and (ii) pay the Fees to Seller at the Closing.

2.

Agreement not to Convert. In further consideration of the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Fees, provided that the representations and warranties made by Buyer in Section 6 hereof are true and correct on the date of the stockholder meeting in connection with the approval of the Merger with the same effect as though made on such date and Buyer has complied in all material respects with its obligations set forth in this Agreement through such date, Seller hereby agrees it has not and will not exercise its Conversion Rights or, if it has already exercised its Conversion Rights, it hereby withdraws and revokes such exercise and will execute all necessary documents and take all actions required in furtherance of such revocation.

3.

No Right to Additional Shares. In connection with the Merger, Enterprise’s stockholders of record are entitled to receive one share of ARMOUR common stock for each share of Enterprise common stock owned immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (the “Exchange”). Although Seller will be a stockholder of record immediately prior to the Merger, Seller hereby acknowledges that Seller irrevocably waives any right, title or interest it may have in receiving any such ARMOUR common stock distributed pursuant to the Exchange. Seller hereby acknowledges that by virtue of the sale hereunder and receipt of payment by Seller of the Aggregate Purchase Price, Seller will not become a stockholder of ARMOUR. Additionally, each of Buyer and Seller hereby agree and acknowledge that this provision is material to this Agreement and a significant consideration in Buyer’s willingness to enter into this A greement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such waiver shall not be effective in the event that Seller does not timely receive the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

4.

Closing Matters. 

(a)

Within one business day of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall send the notice attached as Annex 1 hereto to Continental.

(c)

The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (“Closing”) will occur on the date on which Buyer’s Trust Account is liquidated in connection with the consummation of the Merger, which consummation shall occur no later than 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on the seventh day following Seller’s acquisition of the Shares from Buyer’s stockholders (the “Closing Date”). At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Fees by wire transfer from Enterprise’s Trust Account of immediately available funds in accordance with the Irrevocable Instructions attached as Annex I hereto to an account specified by Seller and Seller shall deliver the Shares immediately thereafter to Buyer electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System to an account specified by Buyer. It shall be a condition to the obligation of Buyer on t he one hand and Seller on the other hand, to consummate the transfer of the Shares contemplated hereunder that the other party’s representations and warranties are true and correct on the Closing Date with the same effect as though made on such date, unless waived in writing by the party to whom such representations and warranties are made.

(d)

In the event that the Merger is not consummated by midnight on November 7, 2009 and Buyer has not dissolved and liquidated its assets and paid Seller the liquidation value of its Shares by November 7, 2009, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds, until Buyer liquidates and distributes its assets to its stockholders, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 4.0% of the Purchase Price Per Share per month (pro-rated on a daily basis based on the date when payment is required and the date such payment is made) or (ii) the highest lawful rate, for each Share held by Seller from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment is actually made. Buyer agrees to promptly dissolve and liquidate and distribute its assets in accordance with Delaware law if the Merger is not consummated by 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on October 30, 2009. 

(e)

In the event that the Merger is consummated and Seller has not received the Aggregate Purchase Price and the Fees by the seventh day following Seller’s acquisition of the Shares from Buyer’s Stockholders, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 4.0% of the Purchase Price Per Share per month (pro-rated on a daily basis based on the date when payment is required and the date such payment is made) or (ii) the highest lawful rate, for each Share held by Seller from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment is actually made.

5.

Representations and Warranties of the Seller. Seller makes the following representations and warranties to and for the benefit of Buyer on the date hereof and on the Closing.

(a)

Sophisticated Seller. Seller is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to evaluate the risks and benefits attendant to the sale of Shares to Buyer.

(b)

Independent Investigation. Seller, in making the decision to sell the Shares to Buyer, has not relied upon any oral or written representations or assurances from Buyer or any of its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives or agents of Buyer, except as are contained in this Agreement. Seller has had access to all of the filings made by Enterprise with the SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) in each case to the extent available publicly via the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system.

In the event the Company delivers to you a Termination Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Agreement, in addition to the other documents required to be delivered pursuant to Exhibit A of the Trust Agreement, then on the date the Trust Account is liquidated, you are hereby irrevocably instructed by the Company to immediately deliver from the Trust Account an aggregate amount equal to USD $ (the “Aggregate Amount”) in consideration for the subsequent delivery immediately thereafter (through the DWAC System to the Company’s account) of an aggregate of  shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) beneficially owned by Victory Park Credit Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., Victory Park Spec ial Situations Master Fund, Ltd. and  (each an “Investor” and, collectively, the “Investors”) which shall be distributed to such Investors contemporaneously in the amounts indicated on Schedule A hereto prior to the release of any funds from the Trust Account to the Company or any other third party. Such amounts shall be delivered to the Investors in accordance with the bank wire instructions delivered to you by each of the Investors. To the extent there is less than the Aggregate Amount remaining in the Trust Account upon distribution to the Investors, then such lesser amount shall be allocated to the Investors pari passu.

  


The funds distribution described above is for the benefit of the Investors, each of whom is hereby made a third party beneficiary of these irrevocable instructions with rights of enforcement. 

  


Each of the Company and Trustee acknowledges that the instructions contained herein may not be amended, modified, waived or otherwise changed by the Company, Trustee or any other person without the prior written consent of all the Investors.
