TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION

1\. Grant of Option. The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan, as a separate incentive in connection with his or her employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for his or her services, a nonqualified stock option to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, all or any part of an aggregate of the number of Shares Granted as specified on the “Summary of Grant Award” page of the service provider web-site.

2\. Exercise Price. The purchase price per Share for this option (the “Exercise Price”) shall be the Grant Price in USD as specified on the “Summary of Grant Award” page of the service provider web-site, which is the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date.

3\. Number of Shares. The number and class of Shares specified in Paragraph 1 above, and/or the Exercise Price, are subject to adjustment by the Committee in the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock dividend, split-up, Share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares. In the event an Employee's termination of service due to the Employee's Retirement within one (1) year following the Grant Date, then the number of Shares Granted shall be adjusted proportionally by the time during such one (1) year period that the Employee remained an employee of the Company (based upon a 365 day year). For example, if the Employee is granted an option for 6,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company and the Employee terminated service due to the Employee's Retirement 30 days after the Grant Date, then the Employee's number of Shares Granted would be reduced from 6,000 shares to 493 shares (6,000 x 30/365) and the balance of the Shares Granted would be cancelled.

4\. Vesting Schedule. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the right to exercise this option will vest as to [INSERT VESTING SCHEDULE], until the right to exercise this option shall have vested with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of such Shares. On any scheduled vesting date, vesting actually will occur only if the Employee has been continuously employed by the Company or an Affiliate from the Grant Date until such scheduled vesting date, or the vesting date occurs within three (3) years following the Employee's Termination of Service due to the Employee’s Retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service due to death or Disability, if the right to exercise any of the Shares specified in Paragraph 1 had not yet vested, then the right to exercise such Shares will vest on the date of the Employee’s Termination of Service.

5\. Expiration of Option. In the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service for any reason other than Retirement, Disability, death or for cause, the Employee may, within three (3) months after the date of such Termination, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any vested but unexercised portion of this option. In the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service due to Disability, the Employee may, within one (1) year after the date of such Termination, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any vested but unexercised portion of this option. In the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service due to Retirement, the Employee may, within three (3) years from the date of such Termination, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any vested but unexercised portion of this option. In the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service by the Company for cause (as determined by the Company), the Employee may not exercise any portion of this option that is unexercised on the date of such Termination.

6\. Death of Employee. In the event that the Employee dies while in the employ of the Company and/or an Affiliate or during the three (3) month, three (3) year or one (1) year periods referred to in Paragraph 5 above, the Employee’s designated beneficiary, or if either no beneficiary survives the Employee or the Committee does not permit beneficiary designations, the administrator or executor of the Employee’s estate, may, within three (3) years after the date of death, or prior to the Expiration Date, whichever shall first occur, exercise any vested but unexercised portion of the option. Any such transferee must furnish the Company (a) written notice of his or her status as a transferee, (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer of this option and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to such transfer, and (c) written acceptance of the terms and conditions of this option as set forth in this Agreement.

7\. Persons Eligible to Exercise Option. This option shall be exercisable during the Employee’s lifetime only by the Employee. The option shall not be transferable by the Employee, except by (a) a valid beneficiary designation made in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee, or (b) will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.

8\. Exercise of Option. This option may be exercised by the person then entitled to do so as to any Shares which may then be purchased (a) by giving written notice of exercise to the Secretary of the Company (or his or her designee), specifying the number of full Shares to be purchased and accompanied by full payment of the Exercise Price (and the amount of any income or other taxes the Company determines is required to be withheld by reason of such exercise), and (b) by giving satisfactory assurances in writing if requested by the Company, signed by the person exercising the option, that the Shares to be purchased upon such exercise are being purchased for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof. In the absolute discretion of the Committee, the person entitled to exercise the option may elect to satisfy the tax-withholding requirement described in subparagraph (a) above by having the Company withhold Shares or by delivering to the Company already-owned Shares. No partial exercise of this option may be for less than ten (10) Share lots or multiples thereof.

9\. Suspension of Exercisability. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition of the purchase of Shares hereunder, this option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.

10\. No Rights of Stockholder. Neither the Employee (nor any beneficiary) shall be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any of the Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of this option, unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee (or beneficiary).

11\. No Effect on Service. The Employee’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-will basis only. Accordingly, subject to any written, express employment with the Employee, nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Employee any right to continue to be employed by the Company or any Affiliate or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company or the Affiliate, which are hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. Such reservation of rights can be modified only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company or the Affiliate employing or otherwise engaging the Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, the transfer of the employment of the Employee between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Service. Nothing herein contained shall affect the Employee’s right to participate in and receive benefits under and in accordance with the then current provisions of any pension, insurance or other employee welfare plan or program of the Company or any Affiliate.

12\. Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company, in care of its Secretary, at 3100 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, California 94304, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

13\. Option is Not Transferable. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this option and the rights and privileges conferred hereby may not be transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, pledge, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this option, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this option and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately shall become null and void.

14\. Maximum Term of Option. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this option is not exercisable after the Expiration Date.

Exercise of this option will not be permitted until satisfactory arrangements have been made for the payment of the appropriate amount of withholding taxes (as determined by the Company). If the Employee fails to remit to the Company such withholding amount within the time period specified by the Committee (in its discretion), the award may be forfeited and in such case the Employee shall not receive any of the Shares subject to this Agreement.

17\. Plan Governs. This Agreement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan.
