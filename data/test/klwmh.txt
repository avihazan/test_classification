RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT

, 20

I hereby agree to the terms and conditions governing the Restricted Stock Award as set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, this Restricted Stock Award Acceptance Agreement and as supplemented by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.

In accepting the Restricted Stock Award, I hereby acknowledge that:

(a) The Plan is established voluntarily by Toro, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by Toro at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan, the Restricted Stock Award Agreement or this Restricted Stock Award Acceptance Agreement;

(b) The grant of the Restricted Stock Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future Restricted Stock Awards, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Awards, even if Restricted Stock Awards have been granted repeatedly in the past;

(c) All decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Award grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of Toro;

(d) I am voluntarily participating in the Plan;

(e) The Restricted Stock Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for Toro or the Employer;

(f) In the event I am not an employee of Toro, this Restricted Stock Award will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with Toro;

(g) The future value of the Award Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and if the Restricted Stock Award vests and the Award Shares become non-forfeitable in accordance with the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement or this Restricted Stock Award Acceptance Agreement, the value of those Award Shares may increase or decrease;

(h) In consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Award, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Restricted Stock Award or diminution in value of the Restricted Stock Award or Award Shares resulting from termination of my employment or service by Toro the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of applicable labor laws) and I hereby irrevocably release Toro and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim

6

* * *

  


is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by acceptance of the Restricted Stock Award, I shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived my entitlement to pursue such claim;

(i) In the event of termination of my employment or other service (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), my right to receive the Restricted Stock Award and vest in the Restricted Stock Award under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date of termination of my active employment or other service as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and will not be extended by any notice of termination of employment or severance period provided to me by contract or practice of Toro or the Employer or mandated under local law; furthermore, in the event of termination of my employment or other service (regardless of any contractual or local law requirements), my right to vest in the Restricted Stock Award after such termination, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of my active employment or other service and will not be extended by any notice of termination of employment or severance period provided to me by contract or practice of Toro or the Employer or mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the sole discretion to determine the date of termination of my active employment or service for purposes of the Restricted Stock Award;

(j) Neither Toro nor the Employer is providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is Toro or the Employer making any recommendations regarding my participation in the Plan or my acceptance of the Restricted Stock Award; and

(k) I have been advised to consult with my own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding my participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

I hereby acknowledge that I have received electronically a copy of the Plan, the U.S. Prospectus relating to the Plan and Toro’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. I hereby agree to accept electronic delivery of copies of any future amendments or supplements to the U.S. Prospectus or any future Prospectuses relating the Plan and copies of all reports, proxy statements and other communications distributed to Toro’s security holders generally by email directed to my Toro email address.

Note: If you do not wish to accept the Restricted Stock Award on the terms stated in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement or this Restricted Stock Award Acceptance Agreement, please immediately contact Toro’s Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, or Managing Director, HR & Total Rewards, as applicable, to decline the grant.
