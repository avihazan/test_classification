2005 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 

THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”), made as of the day of , 2008 (the “Grant Date”) by and between The Wet Seal, Inc. (the “Company”) and (the “Participant”) who is a director who serves on the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), evidences the grant by the Company of a stock award of shares of restricted Class A common stock of the Company (collectively, the “Restricted Stock”) to the Participant and the Participant’s acceptance of the Restricted Stock in accordance with the provisions of The Wet Seal, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”). The Company and the Participant agree as follows: 

1. Basis for Award. The award of Restricted Stock is made under the Plan pursuant to Section 9 thereof for service rendered to the Company by the Participant.   
  
2. Stock Awarded.   
  
(a) The Company hereby awards to the Participant the Restricted Stock which shall be subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement. 

(b) Shares of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by book-entry registration with the Company’s transfer agent, subject to such stop-transfer orders and other terms deemed appropriate by the Committee to reflect the restrictions applicable to such shares of Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any certificate is issued in respect of such shares of Restricted Stock, at the sole discretion of the Committee, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the shares of Restricted Stock, substantially in the following form: 

“THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORFEITURE) CONTAINED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT DATED AS OF , 2008, ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND THE WET SEAL, INC.” 

If a certificate is issued with respect to any shares of Restricted Stock, the Committee may require that the certificate evidencing such shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and that the Participant deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the shares of Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement. At the expiration of the restrictions, the Company shall instruct the transfer agent to release the shares of Restricted Stock from the restrictions applicable to such shares, subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law or, in the event that a certificate has been issued, redeliver to the Participant (or his legal representative, beneficiary or heir) share certificates for the shares deposited with it without any legend except as otherwise provided by the Plan, this Agreement or applicable law. During the period that the Participant holds the Restricted Stock, the Participant shall have the right to receive dividends on and to vote the Restricted Stock while it is subject to restriction, except as otherwise provided by the Plan. If the Restricted Stock is forfeited, the Participant will

assign, transfer and deliver any evidence of the Restricted Stock (or the portion thereof so forfeited, as applicable) to the Company and cooperate with the Company to reflect such forfeiture. By accepting the Restricted Stock, the Participant acknowledges that the Company does not have an adequate remedy in damages for the breach by the Participant of the conditions and covenants set forth in this Agreement and agrees that the Company is entitled to and may obtain an order or a decree of specific performance against the Participant issued by any court having jurisdiction. 

(c) Except as provided in the Plan or this Agreement, the restrictions on the Restricted Stock are that prior to the “Vesting Date” (as defined in Section 3 below), the shares of Restricted Stock will be forfeited by the Participant and all of the Participant’s rights to such shares shall immediately terminate without any payment or consideration by the Company, in the event of any sale, assignment, transfer, hypothecation, pledge or other alienation of such shares of Restricted Stock made or attempted, whether voluntary or involuntary, and if involuntary whether by process of law in any civil or criminal suit, action or proceeding, whether in the nature of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may transfer shares of Restricted Stock to his Immediate Family Members (or to corporations, trusts, partnerships or limited liability companies established for the Participant and/or such Immediate Family Members); provided, that, (i) such transfer is for no consideration other than securities or other interests in such corporations, trusts, partnerships or limited liability companies, (ii) such shares shall continue to be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions herein and (iii) the transfer is effected through procedures established by the Committee from time to time. 

3. Vesting.   
  
(a) The restrictions described in Section 2 of this Agreement will lapse with respect to all of the shares of Restricted Stock on (the “Vesting Date”), provided the Participant is still a director serving on the Board on the Vesting Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the earlier of the Vesting Date or the consummation of a Change in Control, the Participant’s service as a director on the Board ceases (i) as a result of his death, (ii) due to his permanent and total disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e) of the Internal Revenue Code), (iii) due to his failure to be nominated or reelected as a director serving on the Board, or (iv) due to any other reason acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion (any of the foregoing, a “Termination Event”), any then unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall automatically vest upon the date of such Termination Event. If the Participant ceases to serve as a director on the Board for a reason other than a Termination Event at any time prior to the Vesting Date, the shares of Restricted Stock that are unvested as of the date of such cessation of service shall automatically be forfeited. 

(b) Upon the consummation of a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date and subject to the Participant’s service as a director on the Board immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control, any then unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall automatically vest upon the consummation of the Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, the definition of “Change in Control” shall have the same meaning as provided in the Plan; provided, that, a Change in Control shall also include (a) the consummation of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; (b) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (c) a transaction or event that the Committee in its sole discretion determines to be a Change in Control for purposes of this Agreement.

5. Adjustments. The Award may be adjusted as provided for in Section 12 of the Plan.   
  
6. Compliance with Law.
