Executive shall report directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Executive shall devote her full time, attention, energies and best efforts to the business of Macromedia based in San Francisco, California, and shall not during her period of employment as CFO of Macromedia engage in any other business activity, whether or not such business activity is pursued for gain, profit of other pecuniary advantage; provided, however, that this Section 1 shall not be construed as preventing Executive from (i) investing her assets in such form and manner as will not require any substantial services on her part in the operation of the affairs of the business entities in which such investments are made or (ii) serving as a member of the board of directors or similar governing body of one or more business enterprises or charitable organizations or foundations, provided such service does not interfere with the duties required of him hereunder and is approved by the Board.

2\. Compensation. Macromedia shall pay and Executive shall accept as full consideration for the services to be rendered hereunder compensation consisting of the following: 

2.1 Base Salary. $300,000 per year in base salary, payable in installments twice per month, with such deductions or withholdings as are required by law.

Following the Effective Date, Executive shall be eligible for the grant of equity compensation awards (the “New Stock Awards”) from time to time under the equity compensation plans and arrangements maintained by Macromedia; however, no New Stock Awards are being granted or promised by this Agreement.

Executive shall be entitled to and shall receive such pension, profit sharing and fringe benefits such as hospitalization, medical, life and other insurance benefits, vacation, sick pay and short-term disability as the Board may, from time to time, determine to provide for the key executives of Macromedia. 

5\. Executive Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement. As part of the consideration between the parties for this Agreement, Executive hereby agrees to remain bound by the terms of Macromedia’s Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement entered into by and between Macromedia and Executive and attached as Exhibit B hereto.

(b) The vesting of any New Stock Award that is a stock option shall accelerate with respect to the number of shares that will vest over the next twelve (12) months and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the date one (1) year following Executive’s termination date, and (ii) the expiration date set forth in the stock option agreement. 

(c) Prior to the payment of any termination benefits under this Subsection 7.1 or Section 8 below, Executive shall execute a general release of claims; provided, however, that such release shall not extend to any subsequent claims Executive may have with respect to those termination benefits or continued option vesting. 

7.2 Circumstances Under Which Termination Benefits Will Not Be Paid. Macromedia shall not be obligated to provide Executive the termination benefits described in Subsection 7.1 above if Executive’s employment is terminated by Macromedia for Cause or if Executive voluntarily terminates her employment with Macromedia other than for Good Reason. Upon the termination of Executive’s employment by reason of her Disability or death, the termination benefits under Subsection 7.1 will be provided. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean (1) Executive’s conviction of any felony under federal or state law, or any fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement or (2) Executive’s commission of a material violation of the Executive’s Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.

(a) a material adverse change in Executive’s position causing it to be of materially less stature or responsibility without Executive’s written consent, and such a materially adverse change shall in all events be deemed to occur if Executive no longer serves as CFO of a publicly traded company, unless Executive consents in writing to such change, 

(b) a reduction, without Executive’s written consent, in her level of compensation (including base salary and fringe benefits) by more than ten percent (10%) or a reduction by more than ten percent (10%) in her target bonus formula under any performance-based executive incentive plans, 

(c) a relocation of her principal place of employment by more than 50 miles, or

For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means Executive’s inability to perform the duties of CFO for a period of 180 consecutive days or a period of 180 days during any consecutive twelve-month period as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness as determined by the Board.

8.1 Period of Continued Employment. During the period (if any) following a Change in Control that Executive continues to be employed by Macromedia or any successor entity, then the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and Executive shall continue to vest in her outstanding stock awards pursuant to the terms and provisions set forth in the agreements governing such stock awards.

For purposes of this Section 8, a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur upon:

9\. Arbitration. 

9.1 Except for proceedings seeking injunctive relief, including, without limitation, allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, copyright or patent infringements, any controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration of this Agreement shall include claims of fraud or fraud in the inducement relating to this Agreement. Arbitration further includes all claims, regardless of whether the dispute arises during the term of the Agreement, at the time of termination or thereafter. 

9.2 Either party may initiate the arbitration proceedings, for which the provision is herein made, by notifying the opposing party, in writing, of its demand to arbitrate.

10\. General. 

10.1 Waiver. Neither party shall, by mere lapse of time, without giving notice or taking other action hereunder, be deemed to have waived any breach by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Further, the waiver by either party of a particular breach of this Agreement by the other shall neither be construed as, nor constitute a, continuing waiver of such breach or of other breaches by the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 

10.2 Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, the provision shall be deemed amended as necessary to conform to applicable laws or regulations, or if it cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the parties, the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if the offending provision were not contained herein.

The rights and obligation of Macromedia under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Macromedia. Any payments or benefits which become due under this Agreement in connection with the Executive’s death shall be paid to her designated beneficiary(ies) or, in the absence of such designation, to the personal representative or administrator of her estate.
