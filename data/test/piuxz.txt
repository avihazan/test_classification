WHEREAS, each of Executive and the Company desires that Executive be employed in the capacity set forth below, under the terms and conditions set forth herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the following representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Executive and the Company, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

Section 1. Position and Duties.

Executive shall be employed as the Chief Technology Officer of the Company and, subject to the general control of the President, Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors, shall perform such responsibilities as are reasonably required of Executive by the President, Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors together with those generally commensurate with the responsibilities performed by the Chief Technology Officer in similarly situated companies. Executive shall perform Executive’s duties in good faith and shall devote Executive’s full business time and effort to the performance of Executive’s duties hereunder. The foregoing shall not preclude Executive from engaging in civic, charitable or religious activities or from devoting a reasonable amount of time to private investments or, with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer, from serving on the boards of directors of other entities, as long as such activities and service do not materially interfere or conflict with Executive’s responsibilities to the Company.

Section 2. At-Will Employment.

  


The parties agree that Executive’s employment with the Company shall be “at-will” employment and may be terminated at any time with or without Cause at the option of either the Company or Executive. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon Executive a right to continue as an employee of the Company.
