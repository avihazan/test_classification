(a) During the Employment Period and thereafter, Employee will disclose promptly to the Company any and all Company Inventions (as defined below). Employee hereby assigns, and agrees during the Employment Period and thereafter to assign, to the Company all of Employee’s right, title and interest in any Company Inventions and in any and all applications and registrations for any form of intellectual property applicable to any Company Inventions. Employee acknowledges that all Company Inventions consisting of Works are intended to be “works made for hire”, as that term is defined in Section 101 of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 (the “Act”), and will be automatically the sole property of the Company within the meaning of the Act. If the copyright to any such Works will not be the property of the Company by operation of law, Employee will, without further consideration, assign to the Company all of my right, title and interest in such the copyright to such Works. Employee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, all claims to moral rights in any Company Inventions. 

(i) “Company Inventions” will mean any and all Inventions and Works in whole or in part conceived, made or reduced to practice by Employee (either solely or in conjunction with others) during or after the Employment Period that (A) are made through the use of any of the Company’s Confidential Information, Company Inventions, equipment, facilities, supplies, funds or proprietary rights or other property of the Company, (B) relate to the Company’s business or the Company’s actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development or business, or (C) result from any work performed by Employee for the Company.

If there is no such Schedule B attached hereto, or if it is left blank, Employee represents that there are no such Prior Inventions. Employee agrees that, if in the course of my employment with the Company, Employee incorporates into a Company product, process or machine a Prior Invention or Work owned by Employee or in which Employee has an interest (regardless whether such Prior Invention is listed on Schedule B), or if the manufacture, use, sale, or import of any Company product or machine or the practice of any Company process would infringe any such Prior Invention or Work, the Company will automatically be granted and will have a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual world-wide license under such Prior Invention or

In the event the Company is unable to secure Employee’s signature on any document necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain, or enforce any patent, copyright, or other right or protection relating to any Company Invention, whether due to mental or physical incapacity or any other cause, Employed hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and each of its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee’s agents and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in Employee’s behalf and stead to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, and enforcement of patents, copyrights, or other right or protections with the same force and effect as if executed and delivered by Employee.

12\. Arbitration.

Except with respect to remedies and rights set forth in Section 10, any dispute or controversy arising under this Agreement or concerning Employee’s employment with the Company (including, without limitation, any controversy as to the arbitrability of any dispute), including but not limited to any claims arising out of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and/or Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 151B, will be settled exclusively by arbitration to be held in Boston, Massachusetts, before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect relating to the arbitration of employment disputes. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction, and the parties irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts courts for that purpose. 

13\. Miscellaneous.

(a) If any provision of Sections 7, 8 or 9 is held to be unenforceable or overly broad, it is the intention of the parties that the court or tribunal making such determination will modify such provision so that the provision will be enforceable to the broadest extent permitted under the law, and that such provision will then be applicable in such modified form. The provisions of the various limitations in Sections 7, 8 and 9 will be construed to be cumulative, and the scope or interpretation of one limitation will not be construed to nullify or reduce the limiting effect of another limitation. 

(b) Employee warrants and agrees that the restrictions set forth in Section 9 are reasonable and necessary to preserve to the Company valuable proprietary and confidential information that gives the Company advantage over its competitors and that violation by Employee of that Section will naturally, necessarily and inevitably result in the disclosure of such information to the competitors of the Company, to its irreparable and material damage. 

(c) To the extent, if any, that Employee possesses or has knowledge of information that is proprietary to a third party or that is subject to confidentiality restrictions properly placed upon it by a third party that would prevent Company from having access to such information (collectively “Third Party Information”), Employee will not disclose such information to Company or to any Company personnel nor will Employee use such information in the conduct of Employee’s employment hereunder. Employee’s duties hereunder expressly exclude use or disclosure of such information. Company expressly disclaims any request or requirement that Employee disclose or use Third Party Information in connection with employment hereunder; and, if Employee encounters such request or requirement, Employee will not make such disclosure or use but will instead promptly report such request or requirement to the Company’s acting compliance officer. 

(d) To the extent that Employee has been employed or retained by any third party in the past whereby Employee has come into possession of Third Party Information, Employee warrants and represents that Employee’s duties for Company as they have been described by Company in negotiation of this Agreement are not substantially similar to those duties that Employee undertook for any such third party such that any Third Party Information would naturally, necessarily or inevitably be used or disclosed by Employee in performing his or her duties for the Company. 

(e) Employee warrants and represents to the Company that Employee is not party to any agreement or understanding (including but not limited to any non-compete, non-disclosure, non-solicitation or similar agreement) that would prohibit, restrict or impair the ability of Employee to work in any capacity or position at the Company. 

(f) Any and all undertakings by the Company in this Agreement (including Schedule A or any amendment of Schedule A) with respect to any future grant of shares or options to purchase shares of stock of the Company are undertakings only to recommend such grant to the Board of Directors or its designee; and, all such grants are subject to and contingent upon separate prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company or its designee (which approval may be withheld for any reason or for no reason), subject to determination by the Board of Directors or its designee with respect to strike price and vesting schedule and subject to the terms and conditions in the Company’s applicable stock option or stock benefit plan and in the Company’s stock option or stock benefit agreement forms that are current at the time of approval. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or any other document or statement to the contrary, no grant to Employee of any option to purchase 

6 of 8

* * *

##### 

shares of stock of the Company will be deemed compensation for past work or for past performance of Employee under any circumstances but will instead be solely an incentive to potential future performance from the date of vesting forward of such right; and, Employee will have no rights, entitlement or expectation of rights with respect to any such option or with respect to the stock subject to any such option except as explicitly set forth in the Company’s applicable stock option plan and stock option agreement forms. 

(g) This writing constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may not be modified, amended or terminated except by a written agreement signed by all parties hereto, provided however that compensation levels may be adjusted by assent of the parties, which assent of Company will be in writing and signed on behalf of Company stating the adjusted level and which assent of Employee may be established by acceptance by Employee of compensation at such adjusted level. 

(h) This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to the Company’s assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Employee are personal and will not be assigned by him or her. 

(i) No waiver by the Company of any breach or default hereunder will be considered valid unless in writing signed by all parties hereto, and no such waiver will be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default of a similar nature. 

(j) If any provisions of this Agreement will be held unenforceable, such unenforceability will attach only to such provisions and will not render unenforceable any other severable provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be carried out as if any such unenforceable provisions were not contained herein, unless the unenforceability of such provisions substantially impairs the benefits of the remaining portions of this Agreement. 

(k) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed one original. 

(l) This Agreement will be deemed to be a contract that is made in Massachusetts, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and, for all purposes this Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of laws principles, provided that to the extent permitted by Federal law the provisions for arbitration hereunder will be under and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above written.
