CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND

INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

  


As a condition of my becoming employed by Diguang International Development Co., Ltd. ("DIDC" or the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, and in consideration of my employment with DIDC and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by DIDC, I agree to the following:

1. Employment . I understand and acknowledge that this Agreement does not alter, amend or expand upon any rights I may have to continue in the employ of, or in the duration of my employment with, DIDC under any existing agreements between DIDC and me or under applicable law. Any employment relationship between DIDC and me, whether commenced prior to or upon the date of this Agreement, shall be referred to herein as the “Relationship.”

2. Duties. I will perform for DIDC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “DIDC Entities”) such duties as may be designated by DIDC from time to time. During the Relationship, I will devote my best efforts to the interests of the DIDC Entities and will not engage in other employment or in any activities detrimental to the best interests of the DIDC Entities without the prior written consent of DIDC.

3. At-Will Relationship. I understand and acknowledge that my Relationship with DIDC is at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or DIDC may terminate the Relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further obligation or liability.

4. Confidential Information.

(a) Company Information. I agree at all times during the term of my Relationship with DIDC and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of DIDC to the extent necessary to perform my obligations to DIDC under the Relationship, or to disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity without written authorization of the Board of Directors of DIDC, any Confidential Information of the DIDC Entities which I obtain or create. I further agree not to make copies of such Confidential Information except as authorized by DIDC. I understand that “Confidential Information” means any Company proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how, including, but not limited to, research, product plans, products, services, suppliers, customer lists and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the DIDC Entities on whom I called or with whom I became acquainted during the Relationship), prices and costs, markets, software, developments, inventions, laboratory notebooks, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, licenses, finances, budgets or other business information disclosed to me by any of the DIDC Entities either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or observation of parts or equipment or created by me during the

* * *

period of the Relationship, whether or not during working hours. I understand that Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, information pertaining to any aspect of the DIDC Entities’ business which is either information not known by actual or potential competitors of the DIDC Entities or other third parties not under confidentiality obligations to the DIDC Entities, or is otherwise proprietary information of the DIDC Entities or their respective customers or suppliers, whether of a technical nature or otherwise. I further understand that Confidential Information does not include any of the foregoing items, which has become publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved.

(b) Prior Obligations. I represent that my performance of all terms of this Agreement as an employee of DIDC has not breached and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information, knowledge or data acquired by me prior or subsequent to the commencement of my Relationship with DIDC, and I will not disclose to the DIDC Entities or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any current or former client or employer or any other party. I will not induce the DIDC Entities to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any current or former client or employer or any other party. 

(c) Third Party Information. I recognize that the DIDC Entities have received and in the future will receive confidential or proprietary information from third parties subject to a duty on the DIDC Entities’ part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. I agree to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the DIDC Entities consistent with the DIDC Entities’ agreement with such third party.

5. Inventions.

(a) Inventions Retained and Licensed. I have attached hereto, as Exhibit (I), a list describing with particularity all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to the commencement of the Relationship (collectively referred to as “Prior Inventions”), which belong solely to me or belong to me jointly with another, which relate in any way to any of the DIDC Entities’ proposed businesses, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to DIDC hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Prior Inventions. If, in the course of my Relationship with DIDC, I incorporate into a the DIDC Entity product, process or machine a Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, DIDC is hereby granted and shall have a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell and otherwise distribute such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or machine.

(b) Assignment of Inventions. I agree that I will promptly make full written disclosure to DIDC, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of DIDC, and hereby assign to DIDC, or its designee, all my right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, improvements or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, which I may

-8-

* * *

solely or jointly conceive or develop or reduce to practice, or cause to be conceived or developed or reduced to practice, during the period of my Relationship with DIDC (collectively referred to as “Inventions”). I further acknowledge that all Inventions which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of my Relationship with DIDC are “works made for hire” (to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by my salary (if I am an employee), unless regulated otherwise by the mandatory law of the State of California.

(c) Maintenance of Records. I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my Relationship with DIDC. The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, and any other format. The records will be available to and remain the sole property of DIDC at all times. I agree not to remove such records from DIDC’s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of DIDC for the purpose of furthering DIDC’s business. I agree to return all such records (including any copies thereof) to DIDC at the time of termination of my Relationship with DIDC as provided for in Section 6.

(d) Patent and Copyright Rights. I agree to assist DIDC, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way to secure DIDC’s, or its designee’s, rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to DIDC or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which DIDC or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive such rights, and in order to assign and convey to DIDC or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto. I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of this Agreement until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world. If DIDC or its designee is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or unavailability or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents, copyright, mask works or other registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to DIDC or its designee as above, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint DIDC and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters patent, copyright or other registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by me. I hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to DIDC or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, which I now or hereafter have for infringement of any and all proprietary rights assigned to DIDC or such designee.

I agree that, at the time of termination of my Relationship with DIDC, I will deliver to DIDC (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to DIDC, its successors or assigns.

I agree that during the term of my Relationship with DIDC, and for a period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the termination of my Relationship with DIDC for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the DIDC Entities’ employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with such DIDC Entity, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of a DIDC Entity, either for myself or for any other person or entity.

I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.
