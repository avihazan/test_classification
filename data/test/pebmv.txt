willful engaging by Employee in misconduct which is materially injurious to the Company; or (3) the conviction of Employee of any felony or crime of moral turpitude. For purposes of this subsection (C), no act, or failure to act, on Employee’s part shall be considered “willful” unless done, or omitted to be done, by him not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

(a) During any period that Employee fails to perform his duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness (the “Disability Period’), the Employee shall continue to receive his annual base salary at the rate then in effect, until the earlier of (i) the end of the Term, or (ii) the 90th day following the commencement of the Disability Period, provided that payments so made to the Employee shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to Employee under disability benefit plans of the Company and which were not previously applied to reduce any such payment. In addition the Company shall reimburse Employee for any theretofore unreimbursed expenses incurred prior to the commencement of the Disability Period.

(b) If Employee’s employment is terminated by his death, the Company shall pay to Employee’s designated beneficiaries, or if he leaves no designated beneficiaries, to his estate, his annual base salary through the date of Employee’s death at the rate then in effect and any theretofore unreimbursed expenses, and the Company shall have no further obligations to Employee under this Agreement.

(c) If Employee’s employment shall be terminated for Cause, the Company shall pay Employee his annual base salary (but not the bonus compensation described in Section 4(b)) through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have no further obligations to Employee under this Agreement.

(d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall terminate Employee’s employment other than pursuant to Section 8(b) or 8(c) hereof (it being understood that a purported termination pursuant to Section 8(b) or 8(c) hereof which is disputed and finally determined not to have been proper shall be a termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) then the Company shall pay Employee, with no offset, an amount equal to three (3) months of his annual base salary at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, such payments to be made in substantially equal semimonthly installments on the
