Permanent Disability continues, the Disability Payment shall be paid by the Company to the Executive in equivalent installments at the same time or times as would have been the case for payment of Base Salary over the unexpired term of this Agreement if the Executive had not become permanently disabled and had remained employed by the Company hereunder, but in no case shall such period be less than 24 months. The Executive may be entitled to receive payments under any disability income insurance which may be carried by or provided by the Company from time to time. Upon "Permanent Disability" (as that term is defined in Section 6.2(ii) below) of the Executive, except as provided in this Section 6.2, all rights of the Executive under this Agreement (other than rights already accrued or the Executive's rights under Section 3.7) shall terminate.

the Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) to relieve the Executive, in whole or in part, of the Executive's duties under this Agreement, or direct the Executive to no longer perform such duties, or direct that the Executive should no longer report to work, or any combination of the foregoing; provided, however, that in any such event the Executive shall be entitled to receive the Base Salary, as would otherwise have been payable to the Executive up to the end of the month of the termination date properly selected by the Company. If the Executive gives notice pursuant to the first sentence of Section 7.1(i), upon receiving the payments provided for under this Section 7.1, all rights of the Executive under this Agreement (other than rights already accrued or the Executive's rights under Section 3.7) shall terminate.

7.2 Termination for "Good Cause." (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company may terminate the employment of the Executive hereunder only for "good cause," which shall mean the termination of employment of Employee because of Employee's personal dishonesty, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties (including failure to travel to the Company's headquarters to the extent necessary to complete his duties), willful violation of any material law, rule or regulation resulting in the Company's detriment or reflecting upon the Company's integrity (other than traffic infractions or similar minor offenses) or a material breach by the Employee of the terms of this Agreement and failure to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Company specifying the nature of such breach or to pay compensation to the Company deemed reasonable by the Company if the breach cannot be cured.

(ii) If the employment of the Executive is terminated for good cause under Section 7.2(i) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Executive any Base Salary earned prior to the effective date of termination but not yet paid and any such cash bonus compensation earned pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any incentive compensation plan then in effect but not paid to the Executive prior to the effective date of such termination. Under such circumstances, such payments shall be in full and complete discharge of any and all liabilities or obligations of the Company to the Executive hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to no further benefits under this Agreement (other than rights already accrued or the Executive's rights under Section 3.7).

(iii) Termination of the employment of the Executive, other than as expressly specified above in Section 7.2(i) for good cause or as a result of his Permanent Disability, shall be deemed to be termination of employment "Without Good Cause."

5 

* * *

programs then in effect if greater than foregoing in respect to the fiscal year during which the Executive's termination Without Good Cause occurs plus (C) any other cash or other bonus compensation earned prior to the date of such termination pursuant to the terms of all incentive compensation plans then in effect other than any such plan relating to annual incentive cash bonuses or any similar bonus or incentive plans or programs then in effect; and (2) the additional payments necessary to discharge certain tax liabilities (the "Gross Ups"), as the term is defined in Section 11 of this Agreement, provided that, notwithstanding such termination of employment, the Executive's covenants set forth in Section 9 are intended to and shall remain in full force and effect and provided further that in the event of such termination, the Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) to relieve the Executive, in whole or in part, of the Executive's duties under this Agreement, or direct the Executive to no longer perform such duties, or direct that the Executive no longer be required to report to work, or any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) The parties agree that, because there can be no exact measure of the damage that would occur to the Executive as a result of a termination by the Company of the Executive's employment Without Good Cause, the payments and benefits paid and provided pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be deemed to constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty for the Company's termination of the Executive's employment Without Good Cause.

6 

* * *

voting power of the Company's outstanding securities by any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, but not including any trustee or fiduciary acting in that capacity for an employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company) and such person's "affiliates" and "associates" (as those terms are defined under the 1934 Act), but excluding any ownership by the Executive and his affiliates and associates;

(3) a tender offer or exchange offer is made where the intent of such offer is to take over control of the Company, and such offer is consummated for the equity securities of the Company representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities over a twelve month period; or

(4) the closing of a merger or consolidation involving the Company in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or if, immediately following such merger or consolidation, less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the surviving corporation's outstanding voting stock is held or is anticipated to be held by persons who are stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger or consolidation.

(iii) If an event constituting Good Reason occurs, the Executive shall have the right, exercisable for a period of one year thereafter by delivering a written statement to that effect to the Company, to immediately terminate this Agreement and upon such a determination the Executive shall have the right to receive and the Company shall be obligated to pay to Executive in cash a lump sum payment, subject to the six (6) month delay described in Section 12.11, in an amount equal to the sum of (1) three times (a) the Base Salary then in effect, plus (B) the highest annual bonus amount received by Executive during the preceding three years or the minimum amount of any similar bonus or incentive plans or programs then in effect if greater than the foregoing in respect to the fiscal year during which the Executive's termination Without Good Cause occurs plus (C) the deferred compensation payments that would have otherwise been payable pursuant to Section 3.8 under the Agreement for the term of the Agreement had the Agreement not been terminated, plus (D) any other cash or other bonus compensation earned prior to the date of such termination pursuant to the terms of all incentive compensation plans then in effect other than any such plan relating to annual incentive cash bonuses or any similar bonus or incentive plans or programs then in effect; and (2) the Gross Up (the sum of the foregoing amounts other than the Gross Up being referred to as the "Good Reason Termination Payment"). If the Executive fails to exercise his rights under this Section 7.4(iii) within one year following an event constituting Good Reason, such rights shall expire and be of no further force or effect.

7.5 Intentions Regarding Certain Stock and Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise provided herein, upon any termination of the Executive's employment Without Good Cause or upon the exercise by the Executive of his rights to terminate his employment for Good Reason, it is the 

7 

* * *

intention of the parties that any and all vesting or performance requirements or conditions affecting any outstanding restricted stock, performance stock, stock option, stock appreciation right, bonus, award, right, grant or any other incentive compensation under the Mesa Air Group Employee Stock Option Plan or any other similar incentive plan, under this Agreement, or otherwise received, shall be deemed to be fully satisfied and any risk of forfeiture with respect thereto shall be deemed to have lapsed.

7.6 Certain Rights Mutually Exclusive. The provisions of Section 7.3 and Section 7.4 are mutually exclusive, provided, however, that if within one year following commencement of an 7.3 payout there shall be a Change in Control as defined in Section 7.4(ii), then the Executive shall be entitled to the amount payable to the Executive under Section 7.4(iii) reduced by the amount that the Executive has received under Section 7.3 up to the date of the Change in Control. The triggering of the lump sum payment requirement of Section 7.4 shall cause the provisions of Section 7.3 to become inoperative.

8\. DISCLOSURE

The Executive agrees that during and after the term of the Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive will disclose and disclose only to the Company all ideas, methods, plans, developments or improvements known by him which relate directly or indirectly to the business of the Company, whether acquired by the Executive before or during the Executive's employment by the Company. Nothing in this Section 8 shall be construed as requiring any such communication where the idea, plan, method or development is lawfully protected from disclosure as a trade secret of a third party or by any other lawful prohibition against such communication.

9\. CONFIDENTIALITY

The Executive agrees to keep in strict secrecy and confidence any and all information the Executive assimilates or to which the Executive has access during the Executive's employment by the Company and which has not been publicly disclosed and is not a matter of common knowledge in the fields of work of the Company, including but not limited to information regarding the Company's trade secrets, business plans, marketing plans or programs, any non-public financial information, including forecasts, statistics relating to routes and markets, contracts, customers, compensation arrangements and business opportunities (collectively, the "Confidential Information"). The Executive agrees that both during and after the term of the Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose any Confidential Information to any third person, partnership, joint venture, company, corporation or other organization. The foregoing covenants shall not be breached to the extent that any such Confidential Information becomes a matter of general knowledge other than through a breach by a person with an obligation to the Company to maintain such confidentiality (and the Executive knows that such person had an obligation to keep such information confidential), including but not limited to the Executive's obligation to the Company under this Section 9.

* * *

10\. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

The Executive agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to the Company if the Executive violates the terms of Section 8 or Section 9 of this Agreement and that the Company would suffer irreparable damage as a result of such violation. Accordingly, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction, to obtain injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of such Sections, which injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company.

11\. PAYMENT OF EXCISE TAXES

11.1 Payment of Excise Taxes. If the Executive is to receive any (1) Good Reason Termination Payment under Section 7.4 of this Agreement, (2) any benefit or payment under Section 6 as a result of or following the death or Permanent Disability of the Executive, (3) any benefit or payment under Section 7.3 as a result of or following any termination of employment hereunder Without Good Cause, (4) any benefit or payment under the Plans as a result of a Change in Control, following the death or Permanent Disability of the Executive or following the termination of employment hereunder Without Good Cause (such sections being referred to as the "Covered Sections" and the benefits and payments to be received thereunder being referred to as the "Covered Payments"), the Executive shall be entitled to receive the amount described below to the extent applicable: If any Covered Payment(s) under any of the Covered Sections or by the Company under another plan or agreement (collectively, the "Payments") are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended from time to time, the "Code"), or any successor or similar provision of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), the Company shall pay the Executive an additional cash amount (the "Gross Up") such that the net amount retained by the Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Payments and the federal income tax and Excise Tax on any amounts paid under this Section 11 shall be equal to the Payments. The Gross-Up shall not include the amount of state or federal income tax owed by the Executive on the amount of the Payments excluding any state or federal income tax on the Gross-Up.

11.2 Certain Adjustment Payments. For purposes of determining the Gross Up, the Executive shall be deemed to pay the federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of taxation (currently 39.6%) in the calendar year in which the payment to which the Gross Up applies is to be made. The determination of whether such Excise Tax is payable and the amount thereof shall be made upon the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive. The Gross Up, if any, that is due as a result of such determination shall be paid to the Executive in cash in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of such computation, but no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the Executive remits the related taxes. If such opinion is not finally accepted by the Internal Revenue Service upon audit or otherwise, then appropriate adjustments shall be computed (without interest but with Gross Up, if applicable) by such tax counsel based upon the final amount of the Excise Tax so determined; any additional amount due the Executive as a result of such adjustment shall be paid to the Executive by his or her Company in cash in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of such computation, but no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the Executive remits the related taxes, or any amount due the Executive's Company as a result of such adjustment shall be paid to the Company by the Executive in cash in a lump sum within 

9

thirty (30) days of such computation. The Gross Up payment shall be subject to the six (6) month delay of payment provision described in Section 12.11.

12.3 Binding Effect Assignment. The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall insure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company.

12.8 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction. In any such case, such determination shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In any provision or term of this Agreement is susceptible to two or more constructions or interpretations, one or more of which would render the provision or term void or unenforceable, the parties agree that a construction or interpretation which renders the term or provision valid shall be favored.

12.9 Deduction for Tax Purposes. The Company's obligations to make payments under this Agreement are independent of whether any or all of such payments are deductible expenses of the company for federal income tax purposes.

12.10 Enforcement. If, within ten (10) days after demand to comply with the obligations of one of the parties to this Agreement served in writing on the other, compliance or reasonable assurance of compliance is not forthcoming, and the party demanding compliance engages the services of an attorney to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party in any action shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable expenses during investigation, before and at trial and in appellate proceedings if litigation ensues), directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of a breach by the other party of their respective obligations hereunder. The parties' costs of enforcing this Agreement shall include prejudgment interest. Additionally, if any party incurs any out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, all such amounts shall accrue interest at ten percent (10%) per annum (or such lower rate as may be required to avoid any limit imposed by applicable law) commencing thirty (30) days after any such expenses are incurred.

This Agreement is intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and any regulations and Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"). If the Company determines in good faith that any provision of this Agreement would cause the Executive to incur an additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section 409A, the Compensation Committee and the Executive shall use reasonable efforts to reform such provision, if possible, in a mutually agreeable fashion to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A or causing the imposition of such additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section 409A. The preceding provisions, however, shall not be construed as a guarantee by the Company of any particular tax effect to Executive under this Agreement.

For purposes of Section 409A, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.

With respect to any reimbursement of expenses of, or any provision of in-kind benefits to, the Executive, as specified under this Agreement, such reimbursement of expenses or provision of in-kind benefits shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other taxable year, except for any medical reimbursement arrangement providing for the reimbursement of expenses referred to in Section 105(b) of the Code; (2) the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (3) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

"Termination of employment," or words of similar import, as used in this Agreement means, for purposes of any payments under this Agreement that are payments of deferred 

11
