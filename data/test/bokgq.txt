6\. EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT. If there shall be any change in the Common Stock of the Company, through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spinoff, combination of shares, exchange of shares, dividend in kind or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights under this Agreement and the Plan, the Committee may, in an equitable manner, adjust the number and kind of shares that may be issued under this Agreement and make any other appropriate adjustments in the terms of the Units and this Agreement to reflect such changes or distributions.

The Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such rules as it may adopt (including any as may be required to satisfy applicable tax and/or non-tax regulatory requirements), permit the Participant to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local withholding taxes arising in connection with the Units granted hereunder and any distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect thereof by electing to have the Company withhold shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of tax to be withheld, such tax calculated at rates prescribed by statute or regulation. 

8\. FORFEITURE OF UNITS AND PROFITS. At the discretion of the Committee, all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant in respect of Units awarded pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof, if any, and all or any portion of the proceeds received from the sale of such shares of Common Stock (or, in the event of Change in Control, all or any portion of the Change in Control Amount) shall be subject to forfeiture in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. § 7243 (Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), or any successor statute, as if the Participant were subject to such statute; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8 shall no be applicable on or after a Change in Control Date. 

9\. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND LISTING. The issuance or delivery of any stock certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement may be postponed by the Committee for such period as may be required to comply with any applicable requirements under the federal or state securities laws, any applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange or securities association, and any applicable requirements under any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the issuance or delivery of such shares, and the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any such shares of Common Stock to the Participant if either delivery thereof would constitute a violation of any provision of any law or of any regulation of any governmental authority, any national securities exchange or securities association, or the Participant shall not yet have complied fully with the provisions of Section 7 hereof.
