Further Terms and Conditions of Option. It is understood and agreed that the Award of Restricted Stock evidenced by the Restricted Stock Award Agreement to which this is annexed is subject to the following additional terms and conditions: 

1. Tax Withholding. With respect to the minimum statutory tax withholding required upon the lapse of restrictions on the Restricted Stock, the Participant may elect to satisfy such withholding requirements by tender of previously-owned Company common stock or by having the Company withhold shares from the Award. 

2. Termination of Employment. [Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 3 below, if the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs for any reason, all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited, subject, however, to the Compensation and Succession Committee's right to determine otherwise at any time.][Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 3 below, upon the Participant's Termination of Employment, all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be treated as follows, subject, however, to the Compensation and Succession Committee's right to determine otherwise at any time: (a) if the Participant's Termination of Employment is on account of Retirement [at the Normal Retirement Date] , then no unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and the restrictions thereon shall lapse on ; and (b) if the Participant's Termination of Employment is on account of any other reason, then all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited.] 

3. Change of Control. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in The Allstate Corporation Change of Control Severance Plan (to the extent such Plan is applicable to the Participant) or another written agreement with the Company or to which the Participant is a party, the Restricted Stock, to the extent not vested, shall vest and become nonforfeitable (i) on the Change of Control Effective Date of a Change of Control, as defined in paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of the definition of Change of Control in Section 7, that is not a Merger of Equals, or (ii) on the Consummation Date of a Change of Control as defined in paragraph (c) of such definition of a Change of Control that is not a Merger of Equals or (iii) if applicable, on a later Merger of Equals Cessation Date. 

(b) If a Participant has a Termination of Employment during the Post-Merger of Equals Period, which Termination of Employment is initiated by the Participant's employer for a reason other than Cause or Disability, then the Restricted Stock to the extent not vested, shall vest and become nonforfeitable. 

4. Ratification of Actions. By accepting the Restricted Stock Award or other

benefit under the Plan, the Participant and each person claiming under or through him shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated the Participant's acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan or the Restricted Stock Award by the Company, the Board or the Compensation and Succession Committee. 

5. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company shall be addressed to its Stock Option Record Office and any notice hereunder to the Participant shall be addressed to him or her at the address specified on this Restricted Stock Award Agreement, subject to the right of either party to designate at any time hereafter in writing some other address. 

6. Governing Law and Severability. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. In the event any provision of this Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Restricted Stock Award Agreement, and this Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
