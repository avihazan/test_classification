(a) If Employee is terminated by Company pursuant to Paragraph 10 hereof, Company shall pay to Employee a monthly severance payment in an amount equal to Employee’s monthly salary at the time of termination, less taxes and other deductions required by law, for either (i) twelve (12) months if Employee has less than ten (10) years of uninterrupted service with Company as of the effective date of employment termination or (ii) eighteen (18) months if employee has ten (10) years or more of uninterrupted service with Company as of the effective date of employment termination (the applicable period hereinafter called the “Severance Period”), beginning on the first payroll date after the expiration of the thirty (30)-day period following the date of Employee’s termination of employment and each payroll date thereafter until fully paid, in accordance with Company’s regular payroll practices; provided that Employee signs and does not revoke at the time of termination of employment a General Release satisfactory to Company of any and all claims which Employee may have arising out of or relating to Employee’s employment with and/or termination of employment with Company. 

In addition, if Employee is terminated (i) for any reason other than for Cause under Paragraph 9 hereof or (ii) for an Inability under Paragraph 7 hereof which does not qualify Employee for coverage under Company’s applicable long-term disability policy, Company shall maintain Employee in its group health plan on the same basis as if Employee had remained employed by Company during the Severance Period, for the duration of the Severance Period or until Employee becomes covered under another group health plan, whichever occurs first; provided, that in order to receive such continued coverage, Employee shall be required to pay to Company at the same time that premium payments are due for the month an amount equal to the full monthly premium payments required for such coverage and Company shall reimburse to Employee the amount of such monthly premium, less the amount that Employee was required to pay for such coverage immediately prior to Employee’s date of termination of employment, (the “Health Payment”) no later than the next payroll date of Company that occurs after the date the premium for the month is paid by Employee. In addition, on each date on which the monthly Health Payments are made, Company shall pay to Employee an additional amount equal to the federal, state and local income and payroll taxes that Employee incurs on each monthly Health Payment (the “Health Gross-up Payment on Covered Termination”). The Health Payment and the Health Gross-up Payment on Covered Termination shall be reimbursed to Employee in a manner that complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). The COBRA healthcare continuation coverage period under section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) shall run concurrently with the foregoing Severance Period.

(c) Company’s obligation to make post termination payments pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) shall be offset by any compensation earned by Employee, as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, during the period in which Employee receives such post-termination payments. Employee shall report any such compensation to the Company and shall respond to inquiries by the Company concerning such compensation. 

(d) Company’s obligations under Paragraph 6(a) shall cease in the event Employee fails to comply with paragraphs 6(b) or 6(c) of this Agreement or in the event Employee breaches any of the restrictions or obligations set forth in Paragraphs 14 and 15 of this Agreement. 

7\. Inability. If Employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodations, for whatever reason, for a period of thirteen (13) consecutive weeks or for a cumulative period of nineteen (19) weeks during any twelve-month period, Company shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment, subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act or other applicable law, in which event Company shall have no further obligations or liabilities hereunder after the date of such termination except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6(a) hereof. The termination of Employee’s employment with Company pursuant to this Paragraph shall not release Employee from Employee’s obligations and restrictions under Paragraphs 14 and 15 of this Agreement. 

8\. Death. If Employee dies, Company shall have no further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement to Employee’s estate or legal representative or otherwise after the date of his death; provided, however, that Employee’s rights under employee benefit plans or equity plans shall be determined by the terms of those plans. 

9\. Discharge for Cause. Company may discharge Employee at any time for “Cause,” which shall mean any of the following grounds for termination of Employee’s employment listed herein, which is not cured by Employee within the 30-day period following written notice from the Board of Directors of the specific grounds that could result in a termination for “Cause;” provided that Employee shall only have an opportunity to cure a failure to the extent the failure is curable, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion: (i) Employee’s willful misconduct, fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, gross negligence, self-dealing, dishonesty, misrepresentation, or conviction of a crime of moral turpitude, (ii) willful and repeated failure to comply with the lawful directives of the Board of Directors or any supervisory personnel; or (iii) Employee’s material breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement or other written agreement with Company or Company’s applicable code of conduct or employment policy (or other document of comparable intent). In the event Company terminates Employee’s employment for Cause, Company shall have no further obligations or liabilities to Employee after the date of such discharge. The termination of Employee’s employment with Company pursuant to this Paragraph shall not release Employee from Employee’s obligations and restrictions under Paragraphs 14 and 15 of this Agreement.

* * *

10\. Discharge Not for Cause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Company may discharge Employee at any time without cause by providing Employee with 30 days written notice, which notice Company may waive, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion, by paying Employee for such 30 days. Upon termination of Employee pursuant to this Paragraph 10, Company shall be obligated to provide Employee with post-termination payments in accordance with Paragraph 6, but shall have no further obligations or liabilities to Employee after the date of his termination. The termination of Employee’s employment with Company pursuant to this Paragraph 10 shall not release Employee from Employee’s obligations and restrictions under Paragraphs 14 and 15 of this Agreement. 

11\. Termination by Employee.

(a) Employee may terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement at any time by providing Company with 30 days written notice, which notice Company may waive, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion, by paying Employee for such 30 days. In the event Employee terminates Employee’s employment under this Paragraph 11(a), Company shall have no further obligations or liabilities to Employee after the date of his termination. 

(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph 11(a) above, Employee may initiate a termination of Employee’s employment under this Agreement for Good Reason (as defined herein) following a Change of Control of the Company (as defined below) by providing Company with 30 days written notice of such resignation. As used herein, “Good Reason” shall mean, with respect to Employee, without Employee’s consent, (i) a material diminution in Employee’s base compensation; (ii) a material diminution in Employee’s authority, duties or responsibilities; (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which Employee must perform services (which, for purposes of this Agreement, means relocation of Employee’s principal place of business that results in a commute of fifty (50) miles or more); or (iv) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by Company (or a successor thereto) of the Agreement; provided that for any of the foregoing to constitute “Good Reason” Employee must object in writing to Company (or a successor thereto) within 30 days following initial discovery of its occurrence or proposed occurrence, and which action is not then rescinded or otherwise remedied by Company (or a successor thereto) within 30 days after delivery of such notice, and Employee must terminate employment with the Company (or a successor thereto) within two (2) years following the initial occurrence of the event that constitutes Good Reason. 

(c) The termination of Employee’s employment with Company pursuant to any portion of this Paragraph 11 shall not release Employee from Employee’s obligations and restrictions under Paragraphs 14 and 15 of this Agreement 

12\. Termination In Connection With A Change Of Control. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Paragraph 6(a) above, if Employee is terminated by Company pursuant to Paragraph 10 above or if Employee resigns pursuant to Paragraph 11(b) above within the eighteen (18) month period following a Change of Control (as defined in Company’s 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, as in effect on the date hereof and as it may be amended from time to time, or in any successor plan of comparable 

5 

* * *

intent) (the “Change of Control Severance Period”), Company shall pay to Employee a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to 1.33 times the severance payment that Employee would receive under Paragraph 6(a) above had Employee’s employment been terminated by Company for any reason other than Cause, less applicable taxes and other deductions required by law, within 30 days following Employee’s date of termination of employment; provided, that Employee executes and does not revoke at the time of Employee’s termination of employment a General Release satisfactory to Company of any and all claims which Employee may have arising out of or relating to Employee’s employment with Company and/or termination thereof. To the extent any portion of the severance payment payable under this Paragraph 12 is deemed as deferred compensation, Company shall pay such portion in a lump sum as described in this Paragraph 12 if the Change of Control meets the definition of a “change in control event” within the meaning of section 409A of the Code, but in the form of installments as described in Paragraph 6 above if the Change of Control does not meet the definition of a “change in control event” within the meaning of section 409A of the Code. In addition, Company shall maintain Employee in its group health plan on the same basis as if Employee had remained employed by Company during the Change of Control Severance Period for the duration of the Change of Control Severance Period or until Employee becomes covered under another group health plan, whichever occurs first; provided, that in order to receive such continued coverage, Employee shall be required to pay to Company at the same time that premium payments are due for the month an amount equal to the full monthly premium payments required for such coverage and Company shall reimburse to Employee the Health Payment no later than the next payroll date of Company that occurs after the date the premium for the month is paid by Employee. In addition, on each date on which the monthly Health Payments are made, Company shall pay to Employee an additional amount equal to the federal, state and local income and payroll taxes that Employee incurs on each monthly Health Payment (the “Health Gross-up Payment on Change of Control Termination”). The Health Payment and the Health Gross-up Payment on Change of Control Termination shall be reimbursed to Employee in a manner that complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). The COBRA healthcare continuation coverage period under section 4980B of the Code shall run concurrently with the foregoing Change of Control Severance Period. 

13\. Upon a Change of Control. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any applicable plan, program or agreement (including this Agreement), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control during the term of this Agreement, all outstanding equity rights held by Employee as of the date of the Change of Control will become fully vested and/or exercisable, as the case may be, on the date on which the Change of Control occurs. 

14\. Company Property.

(a) All advertising, sales, manufacturers’ and other materials or articles or information, including without limitation data processing reports, client sales analyses, invoices, price lists or information, samples or any other materials or data of any kind furnished to Employee by Company or developed by Employee on behalf of Company or at Company’s direction or for Company’s use or otherwise in connection with Employee’s employment hereunder, are and shall remain the sole and confidential property of Company.

(e) Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in the foregoing subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) in view of the nature of the business in which Company is engaged, are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of Company, and that any violation thereof would result in irreparable injuries to Company, and Employee therefore acknowledges that, in the event of his violation of any of these restrictions, Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages and an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which Company may be entitled. 

(f) Employee agrees that if any or any portion of the foregoing covenants or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such covenant or covenants shall not be affected and the remaining covenant or covenants shall then be given full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portion(s). If the covenant is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration and/or scope thereof, and the covenant shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.

18\. Miscellaneous.

(a) Clawback Provision. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, in the Company’s 2006 Equity Compensation Plan or in any applicable grant agreement, in addition to other remedies described in this Agreement, if at any time Employee breaches any provisions of Paragraphs 14, 16 or 17, or breaches any provision of Sections 15(a), 15(b), 15(c), 15(e), 15(f), or materially breaches any provision of Section 15(d) or otherwise engages in activities or conduct that constitutes Cause, all outstanding unvested and unexercised equity rights (including, but not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units) held by Employee as of such date shall terminate, and Company may rescind (i) the exercise and/or vesting of any equity right and the delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock upon such exercise or vesting (the “Shares”) and (ii) the payment of any bonus or incentive compensation amounts provided to Employee, in either case, within one year after Employee breaches such provisions or engages in such activity or conduct.

In the event of any such rescission, Employee shall return to Company the amount of any bonus or incentive compensation and the Shares received upon the exercise or vesting of Employee’s equity rights, or if Employee no longer owns the Shares, Employee shall pay to Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of any sale or other disposition of the Shares (or, in the event Employee transfers the Shares by gift or otherwise without consideration, the fair market value of the Shares on the date of the breach or activity or conduct), net of the price originally paid by Employee for the Shares. The payment shall be made in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required by Company. Company shall be entitled to set off against the amount of any such payment any amounts otherwise owed to Employee by Company. 

(b) Waiver. The waiver by Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Employee shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Employee. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by Company’s Chief Executive Officer.

(o) Section 409A of the Code.

(i) This Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under section 409A of the Code. If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under section 409A, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. For purposes of section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a “separation from service” under section 409A of the Code, each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, and the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event may Employee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. 

(ii) All reimbursements and in kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Employee’s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

(iii) To the maximum extent permitted under section 409A of the Code, the cash severance payments payable under this Agreement are intended to comply with the “short-term deferral exception” under Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1((b)(4), and any remaining amount is intended to comply with the “separation pay exception” under Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii); provided, however, any amount payable to Employee during the six month period following Employee’s date of termination of employment that does not qualify within either of the foregoing exceptions from being deemed as deferred compensation subject to the requirements of section 409A of the Code, then such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Excess Amount.” If at the time of Employee’s termination of employment, Employee is a “specified employee” (as defined in section 409A of the Code and determined in the sole discretion of Company in accordance with Company’s specified employee determination policy), then Company shall postpone the commencement of the payment of the portion of the Excess Amount that is payable within the six (6)-month period following Employee’s “separation from service” with Company (as defined under section 409A of the Code) for six (6) months following Employee’s “separation from service” with Company. The Excess Amount shall be paid in a lump sum to Employee within 30 days following the date that is six (6) months following Employee’s “separation from service” with Company. If Employee dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of the Excess Amount, the Excess Amount shall be paid to the personal representative of Employee’s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of Employee’s death.
