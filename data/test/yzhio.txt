During the Term, and excluding any periods of disability, vacation or sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive shall devote as much time to the management of the business and affairs of the Company, the General Partner and the MLP as is necessary for the proper conduct of the business and affairs of the Company, the General Partner and the MLP. The Executive may be required by the Board to provide services to, or otherwise serve as an officer or director of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company, the General Partner or the MLP. During the Term, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to: (i) continue employment with SemGroup or any of its Affiliates, provided that Executive shall at all times act, in his good faith judgment, solely in the interest of the Company, the General Partner and the MLP, (ii) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees and (iii) deliver lectures or fulfill speaking engagements.

As used herein, the term “control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

C. Standard of Performance. The Executive will perform his duties under this Agreement with fidelity and loyalty, to the best of his ability, experience and talent and in a manner consistent with his duties and responsibilities.

A. Base Salary. The Company shall pay the Executive a salary (the “Base Salary”) of $17,500 per month, prorated for partial months of employment. The Base Salary shall be payable in accordance with the general payroll practices of the Company in effect from time to time. During the Term, the Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board after consultation with the Executive and may from time to time be increased (but not decreased) as solely determined by the Board. Effective as of the date of any such increase, the Base Salary as so increased shall be considered the new Base Salary for all purposes of this Agreement and may not thereafter be reduced. Any increase in the Base Salary shall not limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company to the Executive under this Agreement.

B. Performance Bonus. The Executive shall be eligible for discretionary bonus awards payable in cash or common units of the MLP, as so determined solely by the Board, based on performance objectives determined by the Board.

C. Long-Term Incentives. Awards of unit options, unit grants, restricted units and/or other forms of equity based compensation to the Executive may be made from time to time during the Term by the Board in its sole discretion, whose decision will be based upon performance and award guidelines for senior executives of the Company established periodically by the Board in its sole discretion.

D. Benefits.

(1) If and to the extent that the Company maintains employee benefit plans (including, but not limited to, pension, profit-sharing, disability, accident, medical, life insurance, and hospitalization plans) (it being understood that the Company may but shall not be obligated to do so), the Executive shall be entitled to participate therein in accordance with the Company’s regular practices with respect to similarly situated senior executives. The Company will have the right to amend or terminate any such benefit plans it may choose to establish.

(2) The Executive shall be entitled to prompt reimbursement from the Company for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in the course of the performance of his duties hereunder, upon the submission of appropriate documentation in accordance with the practices, policies and procedures applicable to other senior executives of the Company.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 hereof, the Executive’s employment hereunder shall terminate under any of the following conditions:

A. Death. The Executive’s employment under this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon his death.

B. Total Disability. The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if the Executive becomes Totally Disabled. For purposes of this Agreement, “Totally Disabled” means that either (i) the Executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months or (ii) the Executive is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company or any entity that would be considered a single “service recipient” with the Company pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Prior to a determination that the Executive is Totally Disabled, but after the Executive has exhausted all sick leave and vacation benefits provided by the Company, the Executive shall continue to receive his Base Salary, offset by any disability benefits he may be eligible to receive.

C. Termination by Company for Cause. The Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated for Cause upon written notice by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean:

(1)

(2) 

the Executive’s willful and intentional failure or willful and intentional refusal to follow reasonable and lawful instructions of the Board;  
  
(3) 

the Executive’s material breach or default in the performance of his obligations under this Agreement; or  
  
(4) 

the Executive’s act of misappropriation, embezzlement, intentional fraud or similar conduct involving the Company.  
  
The Executive may not be terminated for Cause pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) above unless the Executive is given written notice of the circumstances constituting “Cause” and a reasonable period to cure such circumstances, which period shall be no less than thirty (30) days.

Payments under Section 6.C., with the exception of amounts due pursuant to Section 6.B(1), are conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a release of all employment-related claims; provided, however, that such release shall be contingent upon the Company’s satisfaction of all terms and conditions of this Section.

D. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment upon the death of the Executive pursuant to Section 5.A., the Company shall be obligated to pay, and the Executive shall be entitled to receive:

(1) all of the amounts and vested benefits described in Section 6.A.;

(2) any death benefit payable under a plan or policy provided by the Company; and

(3) continued participation by the Executive’s dependents in the group health plans (medical, dental and vision), if any, of the Company for the remainder of the Term or, if longer, until the first anniversary of the Executive’s termination of employment, as if there had been no termination of employment.

(1) all of the amounts and vested benefits described in Section 6.A.;

(2) the Base Salary, at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of his termination of employment due to being Totally Disabled, for the remainder of the Term, offset by any payments the Executive receives under the Company’s long-term disability plan and any supplements thereto, whether funded or unfunded, which is adopted by the Company for the Executive’s benefit and not attributable to the Executive’s own contributions; and

(3) continued participation by the Executive and his dependents in the group health plans (medical, dental and vision) of the Company for the remainder of the Term or, if longer, until the first anniversary of the Executive’s termination of employment, as if there had been no termination of employment.

Payments under Section 6.E., with the exception of amounts due pursuant to Section 6.E(1), are conditioned on the execution by the Executive or the Executive’s representative of a release of all employment-related claims; provided, however, that such release shall be contingent upon the Company’s satisfaction of all terms and conditions of this Section.

F. Upon voluntary termination of employment by the Executive for any reason whatsoever (other than for Good Reason as described in Section 6.B. or 6.C.), termination by the Company for Cause or any termination following the expiration of the Term, the Company shall have no further liability under or in connection with this Agreement, except to provide the amounts set forth in Section 6.A.

G. Upon voluntary or involuntary termination of employment of the Executive for any reason whatsoever or expiration of the Term, the Executive shall continue to be subject to the provisions of Section 7, hereof (it being understood and agreed that such provisions shall survive any termination or expiration of the Executive’s employment hereunder for any reason whatsoever).

H. For the avoidance of doubt, while termination of employment with the Company will end the Company’s obligations pursuant to Section 4, termination of employment for purposes of rights to severance payments under Section 6.B. or 6.C. of this Agreement shall not be deemed to have occurred until the Executive has terminated employment with the Company, SemGroup and all of their Affiliates, for so long as such entities are considered a single service recipient for purposes of determining whether a “separation from service” has occurred under Section 409A of the Code.
