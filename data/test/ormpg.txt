C.

D. Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason: The Board may terminate Executive’s employment hereunder at any time during the Term for any reason other than for “cause” (as defined above) by giving Executive at least ten (10) days written notice, and Executive may terminate his employment at any time for “good reason” (as defined below) by giving the Company at least ten (10) days written notice. If Executive’s employment is terminated pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall pay to Executive all salary and bonuses accrued up to and including the date of termination, all unused vacation and all unreimbursed expenses which are reimbursable pursuant to Section IV incurred prior to such termination. As used in this Agreement, “good reason” shall be defined as (i) the material breach of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) the assignment of Executive without his consent to a position, responsibilities or duties of a materially lesser status or degree of responsibility than his position, responsibilities, or duties as stated in this Agreement, or (iii) any reduction of the Annual Salary without Executive’s consent.

The Company shall pay to Executive a severance payment in an amount equal to twelve (12) months of the salary then payable to Executive pursuant to Section III.A hereof on the date of termination, but not more than the Salary left to be paid during the remainder of the Term (the “Severance Payment”).

2.

The Company shall pay to Executive all deferred compensation, if any, owed to Executive, under any other agreement in a single lump sum payment immediately following termination. However, any amounts owed under a 401(k) or other plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code shall be paid in accordance with the terms and provisions of such plans;  
  
  


3.

All outstanding stock options allocated to Executive which have not vested at the end of the Term had Executive remained employed by the Company to the end of the Term, shall vest immediately to Executive, provided that such options shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s equity compensation plan(s) and their various grants, as applicable; and

E. Mutual Voluntary Termination: The parties may mutually agree in writing to terminate this Agreement. In such event, Executive agrees, at the Company’s request, to continue providing services for a requested period of time up to, but not more than, six months after such voluntary termination (the “Transition Period”) to facilitate transition. Executive shall be an independent contractor and not an employee during the Transition Period and shall be available to assist in the transition during such period. During the Transition Period, Executive shall receive compensation equal to 110 percent of the Salary at the time of the voluntary termination. Payment of such compensation shall be made at least monthly. It is understood and agreed that Executive, during the Transition Period, may be seeking other opportunities and will not be devoting 100 percent of his time to the affairs of the Company. The Company may elect to terminate the independent contractor relationship with Executive prior to the end of the Termination Period once Executive accepts a full time position with another company.

F. Termination Upon Change in Control: In the event the Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors either six (6) months prior to or six (6) months subsequent to a Change in Control, for any reason other than for “cause” (as defined above), the Company shall pay to Executive all salary and bonuses accrued up to and including the date of termination, all unused vacation and all unreimbursed expenses which are reimbursable pursuant to Section IV incurred prior to such termination.

The Change In Control Severance Payment shall be paid in approximately equal bi-weekly installments, or at such other intervals as may be established for the Company’s customary pay schedule, at the annual rate of Executive’s Salary on the date of termination. In the event that a Change in Control occurs within six (6) months after the termination of Executive’s employment hereunder, Executive shall also be paid in a lump-sum, any and all Salary which he would have been due between the termination date of his employment and the date of the Change in Control;  
  
  


2.

The Company shall pay to Executive all deferred compensation, if any, owed to Executive, under any other agreement in a single lump sum payment immediately following termination. However, any amounts owed under a 401(k) or other plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code shall be paid in accordance with the terms and provisions of such plans;  
  
  


3.

All outstanding stock options allocated to Executive which have not been vested at the end of the Term had Executive remained employed by the Company to the end of the Term, shall vest to Executive immediately, provided that if the Change in Control has occurred within six (6) months after Executive’s termination date, Executive shall be paid in a lump-sum payment the fair market value of any terminated options by the Company, assuming such options had been fully exercisable by Executive on the date of termination; and

G. Effect of Termination: In the event Executive’s employment is terminated hereunder, all obligations of the Company and all obligations of Executive shall cease except as otherwise provided herein. Upon such termination, Executive or Executive’s representative or estate shall be entitled to receive only the compensation, benefits, and reimbursement earned or accrued by Executive under the terms of this Agreement prior to the date of termination computed pro rata up to and including the date of termination, but shall not be entitled to any further compensation, benefits, or reimbursement from such date, except as otherwise provided herein.

VI. Covenant Not to Compete.

A. Covenant: In exchange for providing to him Confidential Information, as defined below in Section VII and as a means of enforcing the obligation to protect that Confidential Information, Executive hereby covenants and agrees that during the Term and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, he will not, except as a director, officer, executive or consultant of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, join, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with (as director, officer, executive, consultant, agent, independent contractor of otherwise) in any other manner with any business engaged in the Defined Business (as defined below) which is the same or substantially similar in nature to the business engaged in by the Company or contemplated by the Company as of the date thereof in the United States of America and each foreign country in which the Company does business (whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, affiliates, franchisees, licensees, representatives, agents or otherwise).

B. Definition of “Defined Business”: As used herein, the term “Defined Business” shall mean the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling products that are similar to or compete with the current or contemplated products of the Company as of the date thereof.

C. Non-Solicitation Agreement: Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, or advise or recommend to any other person that they solicit for employment, any employee of the Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate), during the Term and for a term of two years thereafter; provided however, that this paragraph shall not preclude Executive from giving an employment reference at the request of any Executive of the Company or at the request of a prospective employer of such Executive.

D. Conflicting Employment: Executive shall not, during the Term, engage in any other employment, occupation, consulting or other business activity directly related to the Defined Business, nor will Executive engage in any other activities that conflict with his obligations to the Company.

E. Unique and Essential Nature of Services of Executive: Executive understands and acknowledges that the Company is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon the unique and essential nature of the personal services Executive is to perform as an Executive of the Company and that irreparable injury would befall the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates should Executive serve a competitor of, or compete, with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.

F. Acknowledgment of Reasonableness of Restrictions: Executive specifically acknowledges and agrees that the post-employment limitation upon his activities as specified above, together with the geographical limitations set forth above, are reasonable limitations as to time and place upon Executive’s post-employment activities and that the restrictions are necessary to preserve, promote and protect the business, accounts and good-will of the Company and impose no greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to secure such protection.

G. Limitation on Scope or Duration: In the event that any provision of this Section VI shall be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction by reason of the geographic or business scope or the duration thereof, such invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to the scope or duration of such provision and shall not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Section VI and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this Section shall be construed as if the geographic or business scope or the duration of such provision had been more narrowly drafted so as not to be invalid or unenforceable but rather to provide the broadest protection to the Company permitted by law.

Executive is not bound by any non-disclosure or non-compete agreement which would in any way affect Executive’s performance of this Agreement. Executive has no obligations to others which are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or with Executive’s duties to the Company under this Agreement.

XI. Exit Interview.

A. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Executive agrees to participate in an exit interview with the President of the Company and each member of the Board or their respective designee, wherein they will review the obligations under this Agreement and Executive will ask any questions that he may have at that time concerning whether information that he was exposed in connection with this Agreement is considered confidential by the Company. Executive agrees that he will inform the Company at that time of any employer with whom he has accepted employment as well as the position in which he will be employed.
