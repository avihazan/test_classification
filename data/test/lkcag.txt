EXHIBIT 10.3



  


THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made by SPARTAN STORES, INC., a Michigan corporation (the "Company"), and CRAIG C. STURKEN ("Executive"). The parties agree as follows:

1\. Effective Date and Term. This Agreement will take effect as of October 15, 2008 ("Effective Date"), and will remain in effect for successive one-year terms (each a "Term"), renewing on each anniversary of the Effective Date. Either party may elect to terminate this Agreement as of the end of any one-year Term by giving the other party written notice, not later than thirty (30) days before expiration of the then-current Term, of that party's intention to terminate this Agreement at the end of the then-current Term. If such notice is given, Executive's employment will terminate at the end of the then-current Term. Those provisions of this Agreement that expressly state that they will remain in effect after termination of Executive's employment will remain in effect as provided therein. 

2\. Employment. Executive will serve as an executive management-associate as Executive Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and on the boards of directors of such of the Company's Affiliates as the Company may request (the "Employment"). Executive will perform the duties assigned from time to time to Executive's position. The Employment will be part-time, with the understanding that Executive will devote the time necessary to fulfill the functions of Executive's position. Executive agrees to comply with Company policies, including but not limited to any applicable Company policy requiring Executive to own shares of common stock in the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" includes any organization controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company.

Not later than sixty (60) days before each anniversary of the Effective Date, Executive shall tender his written resignation ("Contingent Resignation") from the boards of directors of the Company and any Affiliates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors ("Committee"), with such resignations to take effect as of the upcoming anniversary of the Effective Date, but to become effective only if the Committee determines to accept the resignations and so notifies Executive in writing not later than thirty (30) days before the upcoming anniversary of the Effective Date. If the Committee accepts the Contingent Resignation, the Employment and Executive's service on the boards of directors of the Company and any Affiliates will terminate on the anniversary of the Effective Date. If the Committee does not accept the resignations as provided above they shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

In addition, if the Board of Directors terminates the Employment at any time, Executive shall promptly tender his resignation from the boards of directors of the Company and any Affiliates. In that event, the Committee will notify the Executive in writing within thirty days whether Executive's resignation is accepted or declined.

3\. Compensation. Executive will be compensated during the Employment as follows:

(a) Salary. The Executive's salary as of the Effective Date is $300,000 per year (or a pro-rated weekly amount for any partial year), subject to normal payroll deductions and payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices. Executive's salary will be reviewed annually by the Company and subject to the limitations in Section 4(b)(i) may be adjusted to reflect Company determinations of Executive's performance, Company performance, or business or economic conditions. 

(b) Bonus. Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus programs designated by the Company from time to time for senior Company executives, in accordance with the terms of such programs, which are subject to change from time to time in the Company's discretion. 

(c) Benefits. Executive will be eligible to participate in the Company's healthcare, retirement and other fringe benefit programs covering the Company's salaried employees as a group, and in any programs applicable under Company policy to senior Company executives, to the extent that Executive is eligible for such benefit programs based on the level of services Executive provides to the Company. The terms of applicable insurance policies and benefit plans in effect from time to time will govern with regard to specific issues of coverage and benefit eligibility. All benefit programs are subject to change from time to time in the Company's discretion.

The Company will reimburse Executive for the COBRA continuation coverage premiums incurred and paid by Executive to continue Executive's employee and dependent health, dental, and prescription drug coverage for the twelve month period beginning November 1, 2008, provided that (A) Executive elects and remains eligible for COBRA continuation coverage, (B) Executive continues to pay the normal employee contribution for such coverage, and (C) that the Company's obligation to provide coverage will end if Executive becomes eligible for coverage under the Company's plans or for comparable coverage from a new employer. Reimbursement for each monthly premium paid by Executive will be made not later than thirty (30) days after Executive requests reimbursement, but in no event later than the end of the second year after the Employment begins.

(d) Business Expenses. The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable ordinary and necessary business expenses that are specifically authorized or authorized by Company policy, subject to Executive's prompt submission of proper documentation for tax and accounting purposes. Such expenses shall be reimbursed within thirty (30) days after Executive requests reimbursement, but in no event later than two and one-half (2 Â½) months after the end of the year in which the expense is incurred.

4\. Termination of Employment.

* * *

  


(a) Termination Without Severance Pay. Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation from the Company or any Affiliate after termination of the Employment as permitted by this Section 4(a), except (A) unpaid salary installments through the end of the week in which the Employment terminates, and (B) any vested benefits accrued before the termination of Employment under the terms of any written Company policy or benefit program.

(i) Death. The Employment will terminate automatically upon Executive's death.

(ii) Disability. If Executive is unable to perform Executive's duties under this Agreement due to physical or mental disability for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days or longer and Executive is eligible for benefits under the Company's long-term disability insurance policy ("long-term disability benefits"), the Company may terminate the Employment under this Section 4(a)(ii). If the Company terminates the Employment as the result of Executive's inability to perform Executive's duties for less than one hundred eighty (180) days due to a disability, the termination of Employment will be deemed to be pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) below.

(iii) Termination by Company for Cause. The Company may terminate the Employment for "Cause," defined as Executive's: (A) breach of any provision of Sections 6, 7, or 8 of this Agreement; (B) willful continued failure to perform or willful poor performance of duties (other than due to disability) after warning and reasonable opportunity to meet reasonable required performance standards; (C) gross negligence causing or placing the Company at risk of significant damage or harm; (D) misappropriation of or intentional damage to Company property; (E) conviction of a felony (other than negligent vehicular homicide); or (F) intentional act or omission that Executive knows or should know is significantly detrimental to the interests of the Company. 

If the Company becomes aware after termination of the Employment other than for Cause that Executive engaged before the termination of Employment in willful misconduct constituting Cause, the Company may recharacterize Executive's termination as having been for Cause.

(iv) Discretionary Termination by Executive. Executive may terminate the Employment at will, with at least thirty (30) days advance written notice. If Executive gives such notice of termination, the Company may (but need not) relieve Executive of some or all of Executive's responsibilities for part or all of such notice period, provided that Executive's pay and benefits are continued for the lesser of thirty (30) days or the remaining period of the Employment. Termination of Executive's Employment because Executive declines nomination for or election to the Company's Board of Directors will be considered a termination under this Section 4(a)(iv). Termination of the Executive's employment due to acceptance of the Contingent Resignation (as  
  
\- - 3 - 

* * *

  
provided in Section 2) will not be considered a termination under this Section 4(a)(iv).

(b) Termination With Severance Pay. Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation from the Company or any Affiliate after termination of the Employment as permitted by this Section 4(b), except (A) unpaid salary installments through the end of the week in which the Employment terminates, (B) any vested benefits accrued before the termination of Employment under the terms of any written Company policy or benefit program, and (C) any Severance Pay to which Executive is entitled under Section 5.

(i) Termination by Executive for Good Reason. Executive may terminate the Employment for "Good Reason" if and only if the Company materially breaches the Company's obligations to Executive under this Agreement, or materially reduces Executive's salary other than an economic or business motivated reduction accompanied by proportionate reductions in the salaries of all senior Company executives. Executive may not resign for Good Reason unless (A) Executive notifies the Company's Chief Executive Officer in writing, within thirty (30) days after the act or omission in question, asserting that the act or omission in question constitutes Good Reason and explaining why, (B) the Company fails, within thirty (30) days after the notification, to take all reasonable steps to cure the breach, and (C) Executive resigns by written notice within thirty (30) days after expiration of the thirty (30) day period under Section 4(b)(i)(B). If E xecutive terminates the Employment for Good Reason, Executive will be entitled to Severance Pay as provided in and subject to Section 5. Executive's failure to object to a material breach as provided above will not waive Executive's right to resign with Good Reason after following the above procedure with regard to any subsequent material breach.

(ii) Discretionary Termination by Company. The Company may terminate the Employment at will, but if the Company does so Executive will be entitled to Severance Pay as provided in and subject to Section 5. Any termination of Executive's Employment by the Company under Section 4(a) that is found not to meet the standards of such Section will be considered to have been a termination under Section 4(b)(ii). Termination of Executive's Employment because Executive is not nominated for or elected to the Company's Board of Directors, or termination at the end of any one-year Term of this Agreement due to notice of termination by the Company pursuant to Section 1, or termination of the Employment due to acceptance of the Contingent Resignation as provided in Section 2, will be considered a termination under this Section 4(b)(ii).

5\. Severance Pay. The Company will pay and provide Executive with the payments and benefit continuation provided in this Section 5 ("Severance Pay") if Executive's Employment is terminated as provided in Section 4(b) and Executive contemporaneously experiences a "separation from service" as that term is defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). For purposes of this Agreement, a separation from service will be  
  
\- - 4 - 

* * *

  
presumed if Executive's level of bona fide services reduces by more than 50% from the level of bona fide services Executive performed over the preceding 36-month period. 

(a) Amount and Duration of Severance Pay. Subject to the other provisions of this Section, Severance Pay will consist of a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) and (ii) as follows:

(i) if Executive's separation from service occurs before November 1, 2009, the amount the Company would have been required to reimburse Executive for COBRA continuation coverage under the second paragraph of Section 3(c) if the Employment had continued until November 1, 2009 and all the conditions of Section 3(c) were satisfied; and

(ii) fifty-two weeks of Executive's normal weekly salary installments, payable as provided in Section 5(b), except that if the separation from service occurs during 2008 payment will be made by (A) continuing Executive's then-current salary installments (in accordance with the Company's normal pay practice) through December 31, 2008, and (B) payment to Executive as provided in Section 5(b) of a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the remaining balance of the payment due under this Section 5(a). The lump sum cash payment will be considered wages allocated equally to each of the weeks covered by the payment for purposes of any applicable unemployment compensation or workers compensation laws, and any applicable disability insurance program, but will not be considered to extend Executive's employment beyond the date of Executive's separation from service under any Company qualified retirement plan or other Company benefit plan or pr ogram. 

(b) Payment Terms. Any salary continuation payments for 2008 under Section 5(a) will be made on the Company's normal pay date for each payment. The lump sum cash payment under Section 5(a) will be made on the Company's first normal pay date after the release provided for in Section 5(c)(iii) becomes effective and after any 2008 salary continuation payments have been made, or earlier if required by this Section 5(b). In any event, no payments will be made under this Section until the Company's first regular pay date after Executive has signed the release provided for in Section 5(c)(iii) and any revocation period provided for in the release has expired. In no event will the latest date for (A) signing of the release, and (B) expiration of any revocation period in the release, and (C) the completion of payments under Section 5(a)(i), be deferred beyond the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month after the end of the calendar y ear in which the Executive's separation from service occurs.

Example: If Executive were terminated on November 1, 2008, salary continuation payments would be made for the balance of 2008, and the balance of Executive's salary installments through the end of the then-current Term would be paid in a lump sum on the first payroll date in 2009, provided that no payments would be made until the release is signed and becomes effective, and provided further that all payments must be made at latest by March 15, 2009.

The Executive will receive the payments called for by Section 5(a) notwithstanding any other earnings that Executive may have, and subject to offset only as provided in Section 5(d). If Executive dies before all payments have been made as provided by this Section 5, any 2008 salary continuation under Section 5(a) will continue for the remainder of 2008 and such payments and any lump sum cash payment will be paid to Executive's designated beneficiary (or Executive's estate if Executive fails to designate a beneficiary). If Executive becomes eligible for long-term disability benefits, no further payments will be made under Section 5(a)(ii) after the date that Executive is eligible to begin receiving such disability benefits.

(c) Conditions to Severance Pay. To be eligible for Severance Pay, Executive must meet the following conditions: (i) Executive must comply with Executive's obligations under this Agreement that continue after termination of the Employment; (ii) Executive must not claim unemployment compensation for any week for which Executive receives payment under Section 5(a)(ii); (iii) Executive must promptly sign and continue to honor a release, in form acceptable to the Company, of any and all claims arising out of or relating to Executive's Employment or its termination and that Executive might otherwise have against the Company, the Company's Affiliates, any of their officers, directors, employees and agents, provided that the release will not waive Executive's right to any payments due under this Section or Section 4, or any right of Executive to liability insurance coverage under any liability insurance policy or to indemnification under the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or any written indemnification agreement; (iv) Executive must reaffirm in writing upon request by Company Executive's obligations under Sections 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement; (v) Executive must resign upon written request by Company from all positions with or representing the Company or any Affiliate, including but not limited to membership on boards of directors; and (vi) Executive must provide the Company for a period of ninety (90) days after the Employment termination date with consulting services regarding matters within the scope of Executive's former duties, upon request by the Company's Chief Executive Officer; Executive will only be required to provide those services by telephone at Executive's reasonable convenience and without substantial interference with Executive's other activities or commitments.

(d) Offsets to Severance Pay. The Severance Pay due to Executive under Section 5(a) will be reduced (but not below 0) by the following: (i) any disability benefits to which Executive will be entitled for the remainder of the then-current Term under any disability insurance policy or program of the Company or any Affiliate (including but not limited to worker's disability compensation); (ii) any severance pay payable to Executive under any other agreement or Company policy; (iii) any payment due to Executive under the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any comparable state statute or local ordinance; (iv) in the event that Executive continues to be a member of the Company's Board of Directors after termination of the Employment, the Board fees to which Executive will be entitled during the fifty-two (52) week period covered by the payments under Section 5(a)(ii); and (v) any amount owing by Executive to th e Company that the Company is legally entitled to set off against the Severance Pay under applicable law.

(e) Delay in Payment to a Specified Employee. Notwithstanding any other timing provision in this Agreement, if, at the time that payments would commence under this Section 5, Executive is a "Specified Employee" as defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then no payment under this Section 5, or under Section 13, may be paid to Executive before the date that is six (6) months after Executive's separation from service. Payments to which Executive would otherwise have been entitled during that six (6) months will be accumulated and paid on the first day after six (6) months following the date of Executive's separation from service. All payments that would otherwise be made more than six (6) months following Executive's separation from service will be made in accordance with the general timing provisions described above.

6\. Loyalty and Confidentiality; Certain Property and Information.

(a) Loyalty and Confidentiality. Executive will be loyal to the Company during the Employment and will forever hold in strictest confidence, and not use or disclose, any information regarding techniques, processes, developmental or experimental work, trade secrets, customer or prospect names or information, or proprietary or confidential information relating to the current or planned products, services, sales, pricing, costs, employees or business of the Company or any Affiliate, except as disclosure or use may be required in connection with Executive's work for the Company or any Affiliate or as may be compelled pursuant to court order or subpoena. Executive will also keep the terms of this Agreement confidential. The Executive's commitment not to use or disclose information does not apply to information that becomes publicly known without any breach of this Agreement by Executive. 

(b) Certain Property and Information. Upon termination of the Employment, Executive will deliver to the Company any and all property owned or leased by the Company or any Affiliate and any and all materials and information (in whatever form) relating to the business of the Company or any Affiliate, including without limitation all customer lists and information, financial information, business notes, business plans, documents, keys, credit cards and other Company-provided equipment. All Company property will be returned promptly and in good condition except for normal wear.

Executive's commitments in this Section will continue in effect after termination of the Employment and this Agreement. The parties agree that any breach of Executive's covenants in this Section would cause the Company irreparable harm, and that injunctive relief would be appropriate.

\- - 7 - 

* * *

  
promptly in writing to the Company all such inventions, improvements, developments and other intellectual property, and will cooperate in confirming, protecting, and obtaining legal protection of the Company's ownership rights. Executive's commitments in this Section will continue in effect after termination of the Employment and this Agreement as to ideas, concepts, inventions, improvements and developments and other intellectual property made or conceived in whole or in part before the date the Employment terminates. The parties agree that any breach of Executive's covenants in this Section would cause the Company irreparable harm, and that injunctive relief would be appropriate.

Executive represents and warrants that there are no ideas, concepts, inventions, improvements, developments or other intellectual property that Executive invented or conceived before becoming employed by the Company to which Executive, or any assignee of Executive, now claims title, and that would be covered by this Section if made or conceived by Employee during the Employment.

The decision as to whether the Executive has substantially prevailed, or prevailed in part, and on the amount to be reimbursed to the Executive under the standards in this Section, will be made by the arbitrator. Reimbursement of attorney fees and expenses called for by this Section must be made within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the arbitrator's award, but in no event after the last day of the year following that in which the expense being reimbursed was incurred.

The parties agree that Kent County is a mutually convenient forum and that each of the parties conducts business in Kent County.

17\. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in original or by fax in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and together the counterparts shall constitute one complete document.

18\. Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance. If obligated to reimburse the Company under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Executive will promptly reimburse the Company for any profit, any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation, or any other sums as required by Section 304(a), within thirty (30) days of the earlier of becoming aware of such obligation or receiving written notice of such obligation from the Company.

19\. Coordination of This Agreement With Executive Severance Agreement.

  
\- - 11 - 

* * *

  


(a) Circumstances Under Which Section 8 of This Agreement Will Lapse. If there is a termination of Executive's Employment entitling Executive to Severance Benefits under Section 3 of the Executive Severance Agreement, then Section 8 of this Agreement ("Covenant Not to Compete") will lapse and become void and of no further effect on the date of such termination of Employment. 

(b) Coordination of Severance Pay Under This Agreement and Severance Benefits Under Executive Severance Agreement. If Executive receives Severance Benefits under Section 3 of the Executive Severance Agreement, Executive will not be entitled to Severance Pay under this Agreement. If Executive becomes entitled to receive Severance Benefits under Section 3 of the Executive Severance Agreement after receiving Severance Pay under this Agreement, the amount of Severance Benefits to which Executive is entitled under Section 3 of the Executive Severance Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Severance Pay received by Executive under this Agreement. 

The parties have signed this Employment Agreement as of the Effective Date in Section 1.
