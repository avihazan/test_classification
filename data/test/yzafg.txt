2. LIMITATION ON OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES: The Executive shall devote his full employment energies, interest, abilities and time to the performance of the obligations hereunder and shall not, without written consent of the Corporation, through its President and CEO, render to others any service of any kind for compensation, and in addition, shall not engage in any activity which conflicts or interferes with the performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder.

The number of option shares to be granted and their timing and other terms will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board and governed by the Corporation’s 1997 Incentive Plan (as adopted May 28, 1997 and amended and restated September 24, 1997, May 21, 1998, May 13, 1999, and June 10, 2002) [hereinafter referred to as “1997 Incentive Plan”], which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  
  
D. BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES:  
  
1. Medical and Other Insurance Coverage: The Corporation shall provide such medical and other insurance coverage to the Executive to the extent and on the terms that such benefits are made available to other similarly situated employees. This provision does not alter the Corporation’s right to modify or eliminate any employee benefit plan from time to time and does not guarantee the continuation of any kind or level of benefit or perquisite.  
2. Paid Personal Leave: The Executive shall receive vacation, sick and personal holiday leave pursuant to the Corporation’s Paid Personal Leave Policy (“PPL”) under the schedule for an Executive of the Company, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.

E. COMPENSATION UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL: Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if there is a “change in control” of the Corporation (as hereinafter defined) during the Term of this Agreement, and within twelve (12) months thereafter, either (1) the Executive is terminated Without Cause (as hereinafter defined in section F) or (2) the Executive’s responsibilities are significantly reduced and, as a result, the Executive terminates his employment pursuant to section J, the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits set forth below.  
  
1. Base Compensation: The Corporation shall pay the Executive sixteen (16) months of his then current base salary. This compensation will be paid in two parts, as follows: (a) an initial lump-sum payment of eight (8) months of base salary will be paid within ten (10) working days of termination of employment and (b) beginning six (6) months after termination of employment, equal monthly payments for eight (8) months thereafter.

employment and include in this notice what his base compensation and expected start date are. However, if the Executive’s base compensation at such new employment is equal to or exceeds his prior base salary at the Corporation, the Executive may simply confirm this fact in the notice in lieu of disclosing the actual new base compensation figure.  
2. Stock Options: The disposition of any and all stock options granted by the Corporation to the Executive will be governed by the 1997 Incentive Plan.  
3. Bonus Compensation: The Corporation shall pay the Executive, within thirty (30) calendar days of termination, his performance bonus, pro-rated to reflect the date of termination.  
4. Medical Benefits: If the Executive elects to continue medical benefits coverage under COBRA, the Corporation will pay the applicable COBRA premium for a period of the lesser of eighteen (18) months or until such time as the Executive obtains other employment that provides medical benefits coverage, provided the Executive and any of his eligible dependents elect COBRA continuation coverage. This provision is otherwise subject to all applicable COBRA continuation requirements and does not alter the Corporation’s right to amend or terminate its medical plan.  
5. Other Benefits: If the Executive is involved in pre-approved course work eligible for reimbursement under the Corporation’s Tuition Assistance Program (“Program”) or has an education assistance loan outstanding under that Program, the Corporation will reimburse any remaining balance due on the course work and forgive any indebtedness in connection with the outstanding education assistance loan. This provision is otherwise subject to all applicable Tuition Assistance Program requirements and does not alter the Corporation’s right to amend or terminate its Program.  
  
A “change in control” for purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed to have occurred if the Corporation is subject to an acquisition in accordance with Section 2.12 (a) of the Corporation’s 1997 Incentive Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. 

The privileges, compensation, and benefits set forth in section E survive the expiration of this Agreement as long as there is a “change in control” as herein defined during the Term of this Agreement. 

All compensation paid by the Corporation under section E will be subject to all appropriate federal, state and local withholding requirements. Also, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or distribution of any type to or for the benefit of the Executive by the Corporation, any affiliate of the Corporation, any

person who acquires ownership or effective control of the Corporation or ownership of a substantial portion of the Corporation’s assets (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”), and the regulations thereunder), or any affiliate of such person, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the “Total Payment”), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax. The Corporation shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which is payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating payments which are not payable in cash, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are paid the farthest in time from the determination that the Total Payments need to be reduced. All determinations required to be made under this provision shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm that is the Corporation’s outside auditor at the time of such determinations. 

Any dispute between the Executive and the Corporation, it successors and assigns, involving section E will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with section Q below, except any 280G determination made by Corporation’s outside auditor shall be binding, final, and conclusive upon the Corporation and the Executive.   
  
F. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT: During the Term of this Agreement, Executive’s employment is not at-will and may be terminated by the Corporation only on two bases: (1) Cause; or (2) Without Cause. As used in this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean that the Executive:

The Board, or the delegated committee of the Board, will in its sole discretion determine the time, place, and manner of the opportunity for the Executive to be heard, but to the extent practicable any such meeting will take place in Montgomery County, Maryland during regular business hours. If the Executive fails to appear or to follow the manner of opportunity afforded by the Board or its committee, the Board, or the delegated committee, may render its decision without hearing the Executive’s views.

period of the lesser of eighteen (18) months or until such time as the Executive obtains other employment that provides medical benefits coverage, provided the Executive and any of his eligible dependents elect COBRA continuation coverage. This provision is otherwise subject to all applicable COBRA continuation requirements and does not alter the Corporation’s right to amend or terminate its medical plan.  
5. Other Benefits: If the Executive is involved in pre-approved course work eligible for reimbursement under the Corporation’s Tuition Assistance Program (“Program”) or has an education assistance loan outstanding under that Program, the Corporation will reimburse any remaining balance due on the course work and forgive any indebtedness in connection with the outstanding education assistance loan.
