The Executive will report to the Company Board and will devote his best efforts to the business and affairs of the Company.

4. Term and Termination.

(a) Duration. Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the term of this Agreement will commence as of the date first written above, will continue thereafter for an initial term of two years, and will automatically renew thereafter for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written termination notice to the other no later than 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as set forth in the last sentence of this subsection, the Executive’s employment with the Company will terminate (i) 30 days following delivery by the Company to the Executive of written notice to such effect (unless the termination is for Cause, in which case no advance notice is required, except as set forth in clause (E) below) and may be given for any or no reason, (ii) 30 days following delivery by the Executive to the Company of the Executive’s resignation (unless the resignation is for Good Reason and the Company refuses in writing to cure its breach of this Agreement or if such breach is incapable of cure), or (iii) upon the Executive’s death or permanent disability or incapacity (as determined by the Company Board in its reasonable and good faith judgment). As used herein, “Cause” means (A) the conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, (B) the commission of any act involving dishonesty, fraud or a breach of the duty of loyalty with respect to the Company or any of its Affiliates or conduct tending to bring the Company or any of its Affiliates into public disgrace or disrepute, (C) gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to the Company or any of its Affiliates, (D) addiction to drugs or alcohol if the Executive is not undergoing rehabilitation treatment or (E) a material breach by the Executive of this Agreement which (if capable of cure) is not cured within 30 days after the Executive’s receipt of written notice of the same from the Company.

(b) Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. If the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, and subject to the Executive’s continuing compliance with Section 5 and the Company receiving an appropriate release from the Executive, the Executive will be entitled to receive his Base Salary, benefits and accrued incentive compensation (payable at the time when incentive compensation for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, as provided on Exhibit A) through the date of termination plus severance benefits equal to his Base Salary in effect as of the date of termination (payable in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices) plus his benefits during the remainder of the then current term (the “Severance Period”). As used herein, “Good Reason” means (i) a material diminution or material adverse change in the Executive’s compensation, title, authority, duties or responsibilities, or (ii) a material breach by the Company of this Agreement. If an event which constitutes Good Reason occurs and the Executive intends to resign as a result of such event, then the Executive shall give his resignation notice to the Company within 30 days after the occurrence of such event. Failure to give such notice will constitute a waiver of the right to resign for Good Reason as a result of such event. The Company will have a period of 30 days after its receipt of such notice in which to remedy such event and, if it does so, then the Executive will no longer have the right to resign for Good Reason as a result of such event.

(c) Termination In Other Circumstances. If the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than as specified in subsection (b) above, the
