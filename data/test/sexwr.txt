Employee shall take all steps necessary to safeguard all Confidential Matters and to prevent their use, disclosure, or dissemination to any other person or entity except as necessary to conduct the business of Employer.

If Employee is subpoenaed, served with any legal process or notice, or otherwise requested to produce or divulge, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Matters by any entity, agency, or person in any formal or informal proceeding, including, but not limited to, any interview, deposition, administrative or judicial hearing, and/or trial, upon Employee’s receipt of such subpoena, process, notice, or request, Employee shall immediately notify and deliver a copy of the subpoena, process, notice, or request to the Board. Employee further irrevocably nominates, constitutes, and appoints Employer (specifically including any attorney retained by Employer) as Employee’s true and lawful attorney-in-fact, to act in Employee’s name, place, and stead to do and perform any act which Employee might perform, including to institute, prosecute, defend, quash, compromise, settle, arbitrate, release, and dispose of any and all legal, equitable, or administrative hearings, actions, suits, attachments, subpoenas, claims, levies, or other proceedings, or otherwise engage in or defend any and all litigation in connection with or relating to any request to disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Matters; provided, however, that Employer shall be under no obligation to act as Employee’s attorney-in-fact and may decline to do so upon written notice to Employee.

Section 10. Section 409A.

  


  


* * *

  


  
  
  
(a)

Separation from Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any amounts payable to Employee under this Agreement in connection with a termination of Employee’s employment that would be considered “non-qualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), in no event shall a termination of employment be considered to have occurred under this Agreement for purposes of the time of payment of such amounts unless such termination constitutes Employee’s “separation from service” with Employer as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and any successor provision thereto (“Separation from Service”).  
  
(b)

Section 409A Compliance; Payment Delays. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the Contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the severance payments payable to Employee pursuant to Section 9 shall be made in reliance upon Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (relating to separation pay plans) and/or Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (relating to short-term deferrals). However, to the extent any such payments are treated as “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, and if Employee is deemed at the time of his Separation from Service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Employee is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited payment under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Employee’s termination benefits shall not be provided to Employee prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Employee’s Separation from Service or (ii) the date of Employee’s death. Upon the earlier of such dates, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be paid in a lump sum to Employee. The determination of whether Employee is a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code as of the time of his Separation from Service shall made by Employer in accordance with the terms of Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder (including, without limitation, the default provisions Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) and any successor provision thereto).  
  
(c)

Construction and Interpretation; Separate Payments. This Agreement is intended to be written, administered, interpreted and construed in a manner such that no payment or benefits provided under the Agreement become subject to (i) the gross income inclusion set forth within Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code or (ii) the interest and additional tax set forth within Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (collectively, “Section 409A Penalties”), including, where appropriate, the construction of defined terms to have meanings that would not cause the imposition of Section 409A Penalties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no particular tax result for Employee with respect to any income recognized by Employee in connection with this Agreement is guaranteed and in no event shall Employer be required to provide a tax gross-up payment to Employee or otherwise reimburse Employee with respect to any Section 409A Penalties. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), each payment that Employee may be eligible to receive under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate and distinct payment and shall not collectively be treated as a single payment.   
  
(d)

In-kind Benefits and Reimbursements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any Employer policy with respect to such payments, in-kind benefits and reimbursements provided under this Agreement during any tax year of Employee shall not affect in-kind benefits or reimbursements to be provided in any other tax year of Employee and are not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, reimbursement requests must be timely submitted by Employee and, if timely submitted, reimbursement payments shall be made to Employee as soon as administratively practicable following such submission in accordance with Employer’s policies regarding reimbursements, but in no event later than the last day of Employee’s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. This Section shall only apply to in-kind benefits and reimbursements that would result in taxable compensation income to Employee.   
  
Section 11. Post Employment Non-Compete. As a material inducement for receiving the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information described in Section 7 and other good and valuable consideration, Employee agrees that during the term of his employment and for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of Employee’s employment with Employer, for whatever reason:  
  
(a)

Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, without written approval of the Chair of the Audit Committee, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any employee of Employer or other person providing services to Employer to alter, leave or cease his employment or other service relationship with Employer, for any reason whatsoever;  
  
(b)

In an executive, financial, sales, or operational capacity, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, without written approval of the Chair of the Audit Committee, accept employment from or provide competitive services or assistance to any current customer of Employer with whom Employee has had any contact during his employment with Employer; and  
  
(c)

Employee shall not solicit or attempt to solicit Employer’s current customers (defined as all customers of Employer within the 12 months preceding Employee’s termination of employment) with respect to which

Employer shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and necessarily incurred by Employee in connection with any appeal thereon, including the cost of court settlements. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (i) the obligations of Employer shall be subject to the condition that the Board shall not have determined based on advice from its legal counsel that Employee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of Employer to make an expense or fee advance pursuant to this Section 12 shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Board determines that Employee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, Employer shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Employee (who hereby agrees to reimburse Employer) for all such amounts theretofore paid (it being understood and agreed that the foregoing agreement by Employee shall be deemed to satisfy any requirement that Employee provide Employer with an undertaking to repay any advancement of fees or expenses if it is ultimately determined that Employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law); provided, however, that if Employee has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Employee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Board that Employee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Employee shall not be required to reimburse Employer for any expense advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed). This undertaking by Employee to repay such expense advance shall be unsecured and interest-free.  
  
Section 13. Effect of Partial Invalidity. The invalidity of any portion of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of any other provision. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, the parties agree that the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

(b)

Employer’s Successor. Employer will require any successor to all or substantially all of the business and assets of Employer (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; except that no such assumption and agreement will be required if the successor is bound by operation of law to perform this Agreement. In this Agreement, “Employer” shall include any successor to Employer’s business and assets that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement (either by agreement or by operation of law).
