W I T N E S S E T H 

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the Flowserve Corporation 2004 Stock Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) to strengthen the ability of the Company to attract, motivate and retain Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants who possess superior capabilities and to encourage such persons to have a proprietary interest in the Company; and 

WHEREAS, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company believes that the grant of Restricted Stock to the Participant as described herein is consistent with the stated purposes for which the Plan was adopted; and 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions hereafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Participant agree as follows: 

1. Restricted Stock  
  
In order to encourage the Participant’s contribution to the successful performance of the Company, and in consideration of the covenants and promises of the Participant herein contained, the Company hereby grants to the Participant as of the Date of Grant, an Award of ___shares of Common Stock, subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth below and in the Plan (the “Restricted Stock”). 

2. Restrictions on Transfer Before Vesting  
  
(a) The Restricted Stock will be transferred of record to the Participant and a certificate or certificates representing said Restricted Stock will be issued in the name of the Participant immediately upon the execution of this Agreement. Each of such Restricted Stock certificates will bear a legend as provided by the Company, conspicuously referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions as permitted under Section 15.9 of the Plan. The Company may either deliver such Restricted Stock certificate(s) to the Participant, retain custody of such Restricted Stock certificate(s) prior to vesting (the “Restriction Period”) or require the Participant to enter into an escrow arrangement under which such Restricted Stock certificate(s) will be held by an escrow agent. The delivery of any shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the provisions of Paragraph 9.  
(b) Absent prior written consent of the Committee, the shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder to the Participant may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, from the Date of Grant until said shares shall have become vested in the Participant over the three-year period following the Date of

(c) Consistent with the foregoing, except as contemplated by Paragraph 6, no right or benefit under this Agreement shall be subject to transfer, anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, and any attempt to transfer, anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such benefits. If the Participant or his Beneficiary hereunder shall become bankrupt or attempt to transfer, anticipate, alienate, assign, sell, pledge, encumber or charge any right or benefit hereunder, other than as contemplated by Paragraph 6, or if any creditor shall attempt to subject the same to a writ of garnishment, attachment, execution, sequestration, or any other form of process or involuntary lien or seizure, then such right or benefit shall cease and terminate.  
  
3. Effect of Termination of Employment or Services  
  
(a) The Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Agreement shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule reflected in Paragraph 2(b) above, as long as the Participant remains employed by or continues to provide services to the Company or a Subsidiary. If, however, either:  
  
(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries terminate the Participant’s employment (or if the Participant is not an Employee, determine that the Participant’s services are no longer needed), or  
(ii) the Participant terminates employment (or if the Participant is not an Employee, ceases to perform services for the Company and its Subsidiaries),  
  
then the shares of Restricted Stock that have not previously vested in accordance with the vesting schedule reflected in Paragraph 2(b) above, as of the date of such termination of employment (or cessation of services, as applicable), shall be forfeited by the Participant to the Company.  
(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph 3(a) above, upon the cessation of the Participant’s employment or services (whether voluntary or involuntary), the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to accelerate the vesting of some or all of the unvested shares of Restricted Stock.

4. Forfeiture and Disgorgement Upon Competition  
  
(a) Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event either (A) the Participant violates the provisions of Paragraph 4(b) or the provisions of any restrictive covenants agreement by and between the Company or its subsidiaries and the Participant or (B) the Participant, or anyone acting on the Participant’s behalf, brings a claim against the Company seeking to declare any term of this Paragraph 4 void or unenforceable or the provisions of any other restrictive covenants agreement by and between the Company or its subsidiaries and the Participant void or unenforceable, then:  
  
(i) the shares of Restricted Stock shall immediately cease to vest and all shares of Restricted Stock that have not previously vested in accordance with the vesting schedule reflected in Paragraph 2(b) above, as of the date of such violation shall be forfeited by the Participant to the Company;  
(ii) the Participant will immediately sell to the Company all shares of Restricted Stock acquired by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement that vested within the last twelve (12) months and that Participant still owns on the date of such violation for the Fair Market Value of such Restricted Stock on the date of sale to the Company;

Because the scope and nature of the Company’s business is international in scope and the Participant’s job duties are international in scope, the “Restricted Area” is worldwide.

This restriction applies only to business that is in the scope of services or products provided by the Company; or

Hire, solicit for employment, induce or encourage to leave the employment of the Company or its subsidiaries any current employee of the Company or any former employee of the Company or its subsidiaries whose employment ceased less than three (3) months earlier.

If at any time after termination of Participant’s employment, for any reason, Participant determines that Participant has any Confidential Information in Participant’s possession or control, Participant shall immediately return to the Company all such Confidential Information in Participant’s possession or control, including all copies and portions thereof.  
(e) By execution of this Agreement, the Participant agrees that the provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall apply to all grants (including, without limitation, grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock) made to the Participant pursuant to the Plan in 2006 and, to the extent the provisions of such grants are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Paragraph 4, the Company and the Participant agree that (i) the provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall control and (ii) the provisions of any such award agreements are hereby amended by the terms of this Paragraph 4.

(a) give the Participant any right to be awarded any further Restricted Stock or any other Award in the future, even if Restricted Stock or other Awards are granted on a regular or repeated basis, as grants of Restricted Stock and other Awards are completely voluntary and made solely in the discretion of the Committee;  
(b) give the Participant or any other person any interest in any fund or in any specified asset or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary; or  
(c) confer upon the Participant the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Subsidiary, or affect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of the Participant at any time or for any reason.

Subject to the limitations and restrictions contained herein, the Participant (or Beneficiary) shall have all rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock, including the right to vote and receive dividends.

9. Securities Act

(c) containing such other terms and conditions as counsel for the Company may reasonably require to assure compliance with the Securities Act or other applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations.  
  
10. Federal and State Taxes  
  
(a) Any amount of Common Stock that is payable or transferable to the Participant hereunder may be subject to the payment of or reduced by any amount or amounts which the Company is required to withhold under the then applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or its successors, or any other federal, state or local tax withholding requirement. When the Company is required to withhold any amount or amounts under the applicable provisions of the Code, the Company shall withhold from the Common Stock to be issued to the Participant a number of shares necessary to satisfy the Company’s withholding obligations. The number of shares of Common Stock to be withheld shall be based upon the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of withholding.  
(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph 10(a) above, if the Participant elects, and the Committee agrees, the Company’s withholding obligations may instead be satisfied as follows:  
  
(i) the Participant may direct the Company to withhold cash that is otherwise payable to the Participant;

An authorization to withhold taxes pursuant to this provision will be irrevocable unless and until the tax liability of the Participant has been fully paid.
