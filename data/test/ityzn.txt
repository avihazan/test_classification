AGREEMENT

  


1.

Grant of Award. The Company hereby grants to the Grantee the Restricted Stock Units, subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. All terms, provisions, and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Plan and not set forth herein are incorporated by reference. To the extent any provision hereof is inconsistent with a provision of the Plan the provisions of the Plan will govern. All capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

  


2.

Vesting and Settlement of Award.

  


a.

Right to Award. This Award shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth above (the "Vesting Schedule") and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

b.

Settlement of Award. The vested portion of this Award shall be settled as soon as practicable following the vesting date set forth in the Vesting Schedule, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Award vests. 

  


The Company may require the Grantee to furnish or execute such documents as the Company shall reasonably deem necessary (i) to evidence such settlement and (ii) to comply with or satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, Section 409A of the Code or any Applicable Laws.

  
  


  


  


c.

Method of Settlement. The Company shall deliver to the Grantee one Share for each vested Restricted Stock Unit, less any Shares withheld in accordance with Paragraph 2(e) of this Agreement. Share certificates shall be issued in the name of the Grantee (or of the person or persons to whom such Restricted Stock Units were transferred in accordance with Paragraph 4 of this Agreement).

  


d.

Dividend Equivalents. If a cash Dividend is declared on the Shares, the Grantee shall be credited with a Dividend Equivalent in an amount of cash equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Grantee as of the dividend record date, multiplied by the amount of the cash dividend paid per Share. Such Dividend Equivalent shall be paid if and when the underlying Restricted Stock Units are settled. If a Share Dividend is declared on the Shares, the Grantee shall be credited with a Dividend Equivalent in an amount of Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Grantee as of the dividend record date, multiplied by the amount of the Share dividend distributed per Share. Such Dividend Equivalent shall be settled if and when the underlying Restricted Stock Units are settled, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Dividend Equivalents shall not accrue interest p rior to the date of payment or settlement, as applicable. 

  


e.

Taxes. Pursuant to Section 14 of the Plan, the Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require the Grantee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements applicable to this Award. The Company may condition the delivery of Shares upon the Grantee’s satisfaction of such withholding obligations. To the extent permitted by the Committee, the Grantee may elect to satisfy all or part of such withholding requirement by tendering previously-owned Shares or by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory tax withholding rate that could be imposed on the transaction (or such other rate that will not result in a negative accounting impact). Such election shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Grantee, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropri ate.

  


3.

Termination of Employment. If the Grantee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated, due to the Grantee's (i) Retirement or (ii) death, the Award shall become 100% vested on the date of such termination of employment. 

  


When the Grantee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates (except when due to Retirement or death), this Award shall be forfeited immediately with respect to the number of Restricted Stock Units for which the Award is not yet vested. If the Grantee dies after termination of employment, but before the settlement of the Award, all or part of this Award may be settled by payment to the personal representative of the Grantee or by any person who has acquired this Award directly from the Grantee but only to the extent that the Award was vested upon termination of the Grantee’s employment. 

  


4.

Transferability of Award.

The Award may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or (ii) for no consideration, subject to such rules and conditions as may be established by the Committee, to a member or members of the Grantee’s Immediate Family. For purposes of this Award Agreement, the Grantee’s "Immediate Family" means the Grantee's children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, spouse, former spouse, siblings, nieces, nephews, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships or any person sharing the Grantee's household (other than a tenant or employee). 

  


5.

Miscellaneous Provisions. 

  


a.

Rights as a Stockholder. Neither the Grantee nor the Grantee's representative shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to this Award, except as provided in Paragraph 2(d), until the Award has vested and Share certificates, if any, have been issued to the Grantee, transferee or representative, as the case may be. 

  


b.

Regulatory Compliance and Listing. The issuance or delivery of any certificates representing Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement may be postponed by the Committee for such period as may be required to comply with any applicable requirements under the federal or state securities laws, any applicable listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and any applicable requirements under any other Applicable Law, and the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any such Shares to the Grantee if either delivery thereof would constitute a violation of any provision of any law or of any regulation of any governmental authority or the New York Stock Exchange, or the Grantee shall not yet have complied fully with the provisions of Paragraph 2(e) hereof. The Company shall not be liable to the Grantee for any damages relating to any delays in issuing the certificates to the Grantee, any loss of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the iss uance of the certificates or the certificates themselves.

  


c.

Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. 

  


d.

Modification or Amendment. This Agreement may only be modified or amended by written agreement executed by the parties hereto; provided, however, that the adjustments permitted pursuant to Section 16 and Section 18(b) of the Plan may be made without such written agreement. 

  


e.

Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

  


f.

References to Plan. All references to the Plan shall be deemed references to the Plan as may be amended.

  


g.

The resolution of such dispute by the Board or the Committee shall be final and binding on all persons.

Section 409A Compliance. To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and this Agreement comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any related regulations or other guidance promulgated with respect to such Section by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service ("Section 409A"). Any provision of the Plan or this Agreement that would cause this Award to fail to satisfy Section 409A shall have no force or effect until amended to comply with Section 409A, which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A.
