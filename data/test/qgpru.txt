THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into by and between Grey Wolf, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Texas (the “Company”) and ___, an individual (“Grantee”) on the ___ day of ___, 200___ (the “Grant Date”), pursuant to the Grey Wolf, Inc. 2003 Incentive Plan (effective as of March 26, 2003) (the “Plan”). The Plan is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this agreement shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Plan. 

WHEREAS, Grantee is a Director of the Company, and in connection therewith, the Company desires to grant to Grantee ___ shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, with a view to increasing Grantee’s interest in the Company’s welfare and growth; and 

WHEREAS, Grantee desires to have the opportunity to be a holder of shares of the Company’s Common Stock subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Common Stock and Administration. Subject to the restrictions, forfeiture provisions and other terms and conditions set forth herein (i) the Company grants to Grantee ___(___) shares of Common Stock (“Restricted Shares”), and (ii) Grantee shall have and may exercise all rights and privileges of ownership of such shares, including, without limitation, the voting rights of such shares and the right to receive any dividends declared in respect thereof. The Company may require Grantee to reimburse the Company for, or the Company may withhold from any amounts which it may owe Grantee, all amounts required by applicable federal, state and local law in respect of the issuance or vesting of the Restricted Shares. This Agreement and its grant of Restricted Shares is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the terms and conditions of the Plan shall control except to the extent otherwise permitted or authorized in the Plan and specifically addressed in this Agreement. The Plan and this Agreement shall be administered by the Committee pursuant to the Plan. 

2\. Transfer Restrictions.

(a) Generally. Grantee shall not sell, assign, transfer, exchange, pledge, encumber, gift, devise, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (collectively, “Transfer”) any Restricted Shares. The transfer restrictions imposed by this Section 2 shall lapse as to thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the Restricted Shares on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Restricted Shares on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and one hundred percent (100%) of the Restricted Shares on the third anniversary of the Grant Date; provided, however, that, subject to Sections 3 and 4, Grantee then is, and continuously since the

Grant Date has been, a Director of the Company. The Restricted Shares as to which such restrictions so lapse are referred to as “Vested Shares.”

(b) Dividends, etc. If the Company (i) declares a dividend or makes a distribution on Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides or reclassifies outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or (iii) combines or reclassifies outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the number of shares of Grantee’s Common Stock subject to the transfer restrictions of this Section 2 shall be proportionately increased or reduced so as to prevent the enlargement or dilution of Grantee’s rights and duties hereunder. The determination of the Company’s Board of Directors regarding such adjustments shall be final and binding. 

(c) Extraordinary Transactions. If there is a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), the transfer restrictions of this Section 2 shall automatically cease as of the effective date of such Change in Control, and all the Restricted Shares shall thereafter be 100% vested. 

3\. Forfeiture. If Grantee’s Directorship with the Company is terminated for any reason other than as described in Section 4 below, then Grantee shall immediately forfeit all Restricted Shares which are not Vested Shares unless the Committee, in its discretion, determines that any or all of such Restricted Shares shall not be so forfeited. Any certificate(s) representing Restricted Shares which include forfeited shares shall only represent that number of Restricted Shares which have not been forfeited hereunder. Upon the Company’s request, Grantee agrees for himself and any other holder(s) to tender to the Company any certificate(s) representing Restricted Shares which include forfeited shares for a new certificate representing the unforfeited number of Restricted Shares. 

4\. Death, Disability, Termination Without Cause and Retirement.

If Grantee’s Directorship is terminated due to death, disability (as defined by the Committee) or termination without Cause by the Company, Grantee shall be 100% vested in the Restricted Shares on the date of such termination of Directorship. For the purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean and include (i) chronic alcoholism or controlled substance abuse as determined by a doctor mutually acceptable to the Company and the Grantee, (ii) an act of proven fraud or dishonesty on the part of the Grantee with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries; (iii) knowing and material failure by the Grantee to comply with material applicable laws and regulations relating to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries; (iv) the Grantee’ s material and continuing failure to perform (as opposed to unsatisfactory performance) his duties to the Company except, in each case, where such failure is caused by the illness or other similar incapacity or disability of the Grantee; or (v) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony. Prior to the effectiveness of termination for Cause under subclause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Grantee shall be given thirty (30) days prior notice from the Board specifically identifying the reasons which are alleged to constitute Cause hereunder and an opportunity to be heard by the Board in the event Grantee disputes such allegations.

##### 

If Grantee’s Directorship is terminated with the Company on account of Retirement (as defined in the Plan) and the Grantee enters into a noncompetition agreement with the Company agreeing not to compete with the Company, its Affiliates or Subsidiaries in a form as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (the “Noncompetition Agreement”), the Grantee shall continue to vest in the Restricted Shares in accordance with the schedule in Section 2(a) hereof as long as Grantee abides by the Noncompetition Agreement and does not violate any term thereof as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. If the Committee determines that the Grantee has violated the Noncompetition Agreement, any Restricted Shares that are not Vested Shares on the date of such violation shall be forfeited. 

5\. Issuance of Certificate.

(a) The Restricted Shares may not be Transferred until they become Vested Shares. Further, the Restricted Shares may not be transferred and the Vested Shares may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner which would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws, any rules of the national securities exchange or the NASDAQ on which the Company’s securities are traded, listed or quoted, or violation of Company policy. The Company shall cause to be issued a stock certificate, registered in the name of the Grantee, evidencing the Restricted Shares upon receipt of a stock power duly endorsed in blank with respect to such shares. Each such stock certificate shall bear the following legend:

(b) The certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5, together with the stock powers relating to the Restricted Shares evidenced by such certificate, shall be held by the Company.

All such elections shall be made in writing, signed by the Grantee, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its discretion, deems appropriate.
