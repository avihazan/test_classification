Thereafter, the Company shall be entitled to withdraw such Registration Statement and the

* * *

Purchaser shall have no further right to offer or sell any of the Registrable Securities registered for resale thereon pursuant to the respective Registration Statement (or any prospectus relating thereto); 

(b) if the Registration Statement is subject to review by the Commission, promptly respond to all comments and diligently pursue resolution of any comments to the satisfaction of the staff of the Commission;

(e) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registration under such other applicable securities laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement reasonably requests and as may be necessary for the marketability of the Registrable Securities (such request to be made by the time the applicable Registration Statement is deemed effective by the Commission) and do any and all other acts and things necessary to enable such Holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder; provided, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction. 

(f) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities, the disposition of which requires delivery of a prospectus relating thereto under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event (as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event), which comes to the Company’s attention, that will after the occurrence of such event cause the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, if not amended or supplemented, to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and the Company shall promptly thereafter prepare and furnish to such Holder a supplement or amendment to such prospectus (or prepare and file appropriate reports under the Exchange Act) so that, as thereafter delivered to the Purchaser of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, unless suspension of the use of such prospectus otherwise is authorized herein or in the event of a Blackout Period, in which case no supplement or amendment need be furnished (or Exchange Act filing made) until the termination of such suspension or Blackout Period;

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be quoted on the OTCQB or such other Approved Market on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed or traded; 

(j) provide a transfer agent and registrar, which may be a single entity, for the shares of Common Stock at all times; 

(k) If requested by the Holders, cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holders may request; and 

(m) take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate the disposition by the Holders of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. 

4\. Suspension of Offers and Sales. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(f) hereof or of the commencement of a Blackout Period, such Holder shall discontinue the disposition of Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(f) hereof or notice of the end of the Blackout Period, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company’s expense) all copies (including, without limitation, any and all drafts), other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. 

5\. Registration Expenses. The Company shall pay all expenses in connection with any registration obligation provided herein, including, without limitation, all registration, filing, stock exchange fees, printing expenses, all fees and expenses of complying with applicable securities laws, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and of its independent accountants; provided, that, in any registration, each party shall pay for its own underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes. Except as provided in this Section and Section 8, the Company shall not be responsible for the expenses of any attorney or other advisor employed by a Holder.

6\. Assignment of Rights. No Holder may assign its rights under this Agreement to any party without the prior written consent of the Company; provided, however, that any Holder may assign its rights under this Agreement without such consent to a Permitted Assignee as long as (a) such transfer or assignment is effected in accordance with applicable securities laws; (b) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to become subject to the terms of this Agreement; and (c) such Holder notifies the Company in writing of such transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of the transferee or assignee and identifying the Registrable Securities with respect to which such rights are being transferred or assigned. 

7\. Information by Holder. A Holder with Registrable Securities included in any registration shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required in order to comply with any applicable law or regulation in connection with the registration of such Holder’s Registrable Securities or any qualification or compliance with respect to such Holder’s Registrable Securities and referred to in this Agreement. A form of Selling Stockholder Questionnaire is attached as Attachment A hereto for such purposes. 

8\. Indemnification. 

(a) In the event of the offer and sale of Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, the Company shall, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder, its directors, officers, partners, each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities, and each other person, if any, who controls or is under common control with such Holder or any such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, and expenses to which the Holder or any such director, officer, partner or underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement prepared and filed by the Company under which Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, or any violation or alleged violation of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in connection with this Agreement; and the Company shall reimburse the Holder, and each such director, officer, partner, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, that such indemnity agreement found in this Section 8(a) shall in no event exceed the net proceeds from the Debentures received by the Company; and provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case (i) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement in or omission from such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written 

6 

* * *

information furnished to the Company by the Holder specifically for use in the preparation thereof or (ii) if the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) who purchased the Registrable Securities that are the subject thereof did not receive a copy of an amended preliminary prospectus or the final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented) at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Registrable Securities to such person because of the failure of such Holder or underwriter to so provide such amended preliminary or final prospectus and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact made in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the amended preliminary or final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented). Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Holders, or any such director, officer, partner, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such shares by the Holder. 

(b) As a condition to including Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, each Holder agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section 8 and to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or any such director or officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law, to the extent arising out of or based solely upon: (x) such Holder’s failure to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act or (y) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in the registration statement or such prospectus or (ii) to the extent that (1) such untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder’s proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, such prospectus or such form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (2) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(f) hereof, the use by such Holder of an outdated or defective prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that the prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the advice contemplated in Section 3(f). In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in this Section (including any governmental action), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such action; provided, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice 

7 

* * *

as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such indemnified party a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist or the indemnified party may have defenses not available to the indemnifying party in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defenses thereof or the indemnifying party fails to defend such claim in a diligent manner, other than reasonable costs of investigation. Neither an indemnified nor an indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the rights set forth above, in any event any party shall have the right to retain, at its own expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim. 

(d) If an indemnifying party does or is not permitted to assume the defense of an action pursuant to Sections 8(c) or in the case of the expense reimbursement obligation set forth in Sections 8(a) and (b), the indemnification required by Sections 8(a) and 8(b) shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills received or expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities are incurred. 

(e) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall (i) contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No indemnified party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

8 

* * *

(f) Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the Securities Act. 

9\. Rule 144. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit the Holders to sell the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees, until the earlier of such time as the Debentures are no longer outstanding or the Holders no longer own any Registrable Securities: (i) to make and keep public information available as those terms are understood in Rule 144, (ii) to file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by an issuer of securities registered under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) to furnish in writing upon such Holder’s request a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and to furnish to such Holder a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company as may be reasonably requested in availing such Holder of any rule or regulation of the Commission permitting the selling of any such Registrable Securities without registration and (iv) to undertake any additional actions commercially reasonably necessary to maintain the availability of the use of Rule 144. 

10\. Piggy-Back Registrations. If at any time prior to the Registration Default Date there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each Holder written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days after receipt of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such holder requests to be registered; provided, that, the Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 11 that are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or that are the subject of a then effective Registration Statement. 

11\. Miscellaneous. 

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York, both substantive and remedial, without regard to New York conflicts of law principles. Any judicial proceeding brought against either of the parties to this Agreement or any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any matter related hereto shall be brought in the courts of the State of New York, New York County, or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party to this Agreement accepts the jurisdiction of such courts. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not be deemed to confer rights on any person other than the parties to this Agreement. 

9 

* * *

(b) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and each Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall not assert or shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

(c) Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, Permitted Assignees, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. 

(d) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered, as of the date hereof, and shall not enter, on or after the date of this Agreement, into any agreement with respect to its securities that would have the effect of impairing the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. 

(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subjects hereof. 

(f) Notices, etc. All notices or other communications which are required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered by hand, by facsimile transmission, by registered or certified mail, postage pre-paid, by electronic mail, or by courier or overnight carrier, to the persons at the addresses set forth below (or at such other address as may be provided hereunder), and shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date so delivered:
