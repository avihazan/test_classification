EXHIBIT 10.3 



EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) made this first day of July 2005, between NVR, INC., a Virginia corporation (the “Company”) and DENNIS M. SEREMET, (the “Executive”). References within this Agreement to the Company refer to NVR and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 

WHEREAS, the parties wish to establish the terms of the Executive’s future employment with the Company. 

ACCORDINGLY, the parties agree as follows: 

1. Employment, Duties and Acceptance.   
  
1.1 Employment by the Company. The Company hereby employs the Executive, for itself and its affiliates, to render exclusive and full-time services to the Company. The Executive will serve in the capacity of Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The Executive will perform such duties as are imposed on the holder of that office by the By-laws of the Company and such other duties as are customarily performed by one holding such position in the same or similar businesses or enterprises as those of the Company. The Executive will perform such other related duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Executive will devote his entire full working time and attention to the performance of such duties and to the promotion of the business and interests of the Company. This provision, however, will not prevent the Executive from investing his funds or assets in any form or manner, or from acting as a member of the Board of Directors of any companies, businesses, or charitable organizations, so long as such investments or companies do not compete with the Company, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1.   
  
* * *

1.2 Acceptance of Employment by the Executive. The Executive accepts such employment and shall render the services described above.   
  
1.3 Place of Employment. The Executive’s principal place of employment shall be the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, subject to such reasonable travel as the rendering of services associated with such position may require.   
  
1.4 Acknowledgement. By signing this Agreement, the Executive acknowledges that he has received copies of the Company’s current Code of Ethics and Standards of Business Conduct (collectively, the “Code”), has read and understood the Code’s content, and agrees to comply with the Code in all respects.   
  
2. Duration of Employment.   
  
This Agreement and the employment relationship hereunder will continue in effect for five and one half (5 1/2) years from July 1, 2005 through January 1, 2011\. It may be extended beyond January 1, 2011 by mutual, written agreement at any time. In the event of the Executive’s termination of employment during the term of this Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay all base salary, bonus and other benefits then accrued, as well as cash reimbursement for all accrued but unused vacation, plus, if applicable, the additional payments provided for in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 6.7 of this Agreement. 

3. Compensation.   
  
3.1 Base Salary. As compensation for all services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will pay to the Executive an annual base salary of FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($400,000) payable in equal monthly installments of THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE CENTS ($33,333.33). The Company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion may increase, but may not reduce, the Executive’s annual base salary.   
  
* * *

3.2 Bonuses. The Executive shall be eligible to be paid a bonus annually in cash pursuant to the Company’s annual incentive plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, in a maximum amount of 100% of the Executive’s annual base salary. This bonus shall be paid at the same time (or times) and in the same manner as other senior executives of the Company. Entitlement to the bonus is dependent on the Executive meeting certain goals, which shall be established annually by the Company.   
  
3.3 Participation in Employee Benefit Plans. The Executive shall be permitted during the term of this Agreement, if and to the extent eligible to participate in any group life, hospitalization or disability insurance plan, health program, pension plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan or similar benefit plan of the Company, which may be available to other comparable executives of the Company generally, on the same terms as such other executives. The Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation and all customary holidays each year during the term of this Agreement in accordance with the Company’s policies.   
  
3.4 Expenses. Subject to such policies as may from time to time be established by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the Executive in the performance of the Executive’s services under this Agreement upon presentation of expense statements or vouchers or such other supporting information as it may require.   
  
3.5 Stock Holding Requirement. The Executive is required to continuously hold at all times NVR, Inc. common stock with a value equal to six (6) times the Executive’s base salary as then in effect, subject to adjustment at any time by the Company’s Board of Directors upon thirty days notice.  
  
* * *

4. Management Long-Term Stock Option Plans.   
  
The Executive is a participant in the 1998 NVR, Inc. Management Long-Term Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Broadly Based Stock Option Plan and the 2005 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan. The Executive has entered into separate agreements governing the terms of his participation in the Plans. 

5. Deferred Compensation Plan.   
  
The Executive has certain amounts fully earned under previous annual and long-term incentive plans deferred within the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan. The amounts deferred are held in a fixed number of shares of NVR, Inc. common stock within a Rabbi Trust, and will be distributed to the Executive upon separation of service from the Company. All amounts held for the Executive by the Rabbi Trust pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan are fully vested and not subject to forfeiture for any reason, regardless of the reason for termination. 

6. Termination, Disability or Retirement.   
  
6.1 Termination Upon Death. If the Executive dies during the term hereof, this Agreement shall terminate, except that the Executive’s legal representatives shall be entitled to receive the Executive’s base salary and accrued Bonus for the period ending on the last day of the second calendar month following the month in which the Executive’s death occurred. Accrued Bonus shall be calculated as one hundred percent of Base Salary multiplied by the fraction (x) of the number of days in the calendar year up to last day of the second calendar month following the month in which Executive died divided by (y) 365 days.   
  
* * *

6.2 Disability. If during the term hereof the Executive becomes physically or mentally disabled, whether totally or partially, so that the Executive is, in the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors, substantially unable to perform his services hereunder, the Executive shall transfer from active to disability status. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to in any way affect the Executive’s right to participate in any disability plan maintained by the Company and for which the Executive is otherwise eligible. If the Executive transfers to disability status he would be entitled to receive the Executive’s Base Salary and accrued Bonus for the period ending on the last day of the second calendar month following the month in which the Executive is transferred to disability status. Accrued Bonus shall be calculated as one hundred percent of Base Salary multiplied by the fraction (x) of the number of days in the calendar year up to last day of the second calendar month following the month in which the Executive was transferred to disability status divided by (y) 365 days.   
  
6.3 Retirement. If the Executive elects to terminate employment upon meeting the established criteria for Retirement prior to the term of this agreement, the Executive will be entitled to receive the Executive’s Base Salary for the period ending on the last day worked. The payment of any Bonus amounts due to the Executive shall be payable, in the same form and at the same time that all other employees receive their bonus payment. Bonus shall be calculated as one hundred percent of Base Salary multiplied by the fraction (x) of the number of days in the calendar year up to last day worked by the Executive divided by (y) 365 days. In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to payment of ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) of his then annual Base Salary, paid in twelve equal monthly installments beginning on the fifteenth day of the first month following the date of Retirement. Retirement means voluntary termination of employment after attainment of age 65. However, the Board of Directors within its discretion may determine that the executive who terminates employment prior to age 65 has terminated by virtue of Retirement.   
  
* * *

6.4 Termination for Cause. If the Executive is convicted of any felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, or any crime or offense which results in his incarceration for more than three months, is guilty of gross misconduct in connection with the performance of his duties as described in Section 1.1 hereunder, or materially, breaches affirmative or negative covenants or undertakings set forth in Section 7, the Company at any time by written notice to the Executive, may terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder. Any such termination shall be for Cause.   
  
6.5 Termination Without Cause. In the event the Company on sixty (60) days’ notice terminates the Executive’s employment without Cause (as such term is defined in Section 6.4) during the term of this Agreement, then as full satisfaction of the Company’s obligations to the Executive, the Executive shall be entitled to payment of TWO HUNDRED PERCENT (200%) of his then annual base salary, paid in twelve equal monthly installments beginning on the fifteenth day of the first month following the date of termination. The Executive shall also be provided with outplacement services with a firm jointly selected by the Executive and the Company at a cost not to exceed SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($60,000).   
  
6.6 Voluntary Termination. The Executive may on ninety (90) days’ notice terminate his employment hereunder. In such event, he shall not be entitled to any severance pay except in the circumstances described in Section 6.7 below.   
  
6.7

Voluntary Termination-Change of Control. In the event the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment hereunder in connection with or within one (1) year after a Change of Control of the Company (as defined below), the Executive shall receive a payment of TWO HUNDRED PERCENT (200%) of his then annual base salary, as well as his accrued pro-rata bonus (on the assumption that the maximum annual bonus would have been paid pursuant to Section 3.2) through the date of termination. Payment of such amount shall be in twelve equal   
  
* * *

monthly installments beginning on the first day of the first month following the date of termination. For purposes of this Agreement, “Change of Control” means (i) any transaction or series of transactions (including, without limitation, a tender offer, merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13 (d) and 14 (d) (2) of the Exchange Act), becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20 percent of the total aggregate voting power of all classes of the voting stock of the Company and/or warrants or options to acquire such voting stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis, or (ii) if all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold or otherwise transferred to any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, joint venture, pool, syndicate or similar organization or group acting in concert or (iii) the Company is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or (iv) a merger, consolidation or other reorganization or business combination with any party including a leveraged buy-out or a going private transaction and where there has been a significant reduction in Executive’s responsibilities.   
  
6.8 Voluntary Termination-Change in Senior Management Accompanied by Change in Business Philosophy. If the Company elects a new Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer (the “New Officer”) and provided that the New Officer enacts major changes in the Company’s business philosophy, mission or business strategies, the Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment. To provide sufficient time for a transfer of the Executive’s responsibilities and duties, he shall be required to provide ninety (90) days notice prior to such voluntary termination and the Company shall have the option of extending the notice an additional thirty (30) days. In the event the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment in connection with or within one year after the election of a New Officer accompanied by any of the changes described in this Section 6.8, he shall not be entitled to any severance pay and shall not be bound by the “Covenant Not to Compete” described in Section 7.   
  
* * *

6.9 Effectiveness. In the event any of the events described in this Section 6 should occur during the term of this Agreement, and result in payments to the Executive which would in their normal course continue beyond the term of this Agreement, such payments shall be made at such times and in such amounts as if the term of this Agreement had not expired.   
  
7. Covenant Not to Compete.   
  
The covenant set forth in Section 7.1 shall be applicable during the employment term and for a period of two (2) years after termination in the event the Executive is terminated pursuant to Section 6.3 “Retirement”, Section 6.4 for “Cause”, Section 6.5 “Without Cause” or to Section 6.6 “Voluntary”. 

In the event that the Executive terminates pursuant to Section 6.7 “Voluntary Termination – Change of Control” or Section 6.8 “Voluntary Termination-Change in Senior Management Accompanied by Change in Business Philosophy”, the non-competition provisions of Section 7 become void. All other provisions in Section 7 remain in full force and effect.

Reasonableness.
