* * *

continue to pay Employee, as severance, Salary for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination (“Severance Period”).

No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between the parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other acts hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other acts. The rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are in addition to all other rights and remedies, at law or equity, that they may have against each other.   
  
12) Assignment. This Agreement, and the Employee’s rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by the Employee. The Company may assign its rights, and delegate its obligations, hereunder to any affiliate of the Company or to any successor to the Company’s business. The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon their respective successors and assigns, and shall be enforceable by such successors and assigns.   
  
13) Severability; Survival. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be void and unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent possible so as to be enforceable (or if not subject to modification, then eliminated herefrom) for the purpose of those procedures to the extent necessary to permit the remaining provisions to be enforced. The provisions of Sections 3 through 16 of this Agreement shall survive the termination for any reason of the Employee’s relationship with the Company.   
  
14) Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.   
  
15) Governing Law.
