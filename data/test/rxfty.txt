The parties agree that at the Company’s sole discretion any of the payments described in this Section 2(e) shall be billed directly to the Company. The parties further agree that all Relocation and Residential Purchase items set forth in Schedule 1 hereto are deemed to be reasonable and, therefore, approved (but each shall still require pre-approval in regards to cost) and that Relocation and Residential Purchase items not set forth in Schedule 1 are presumed to be unreasonable and are therefore subject to pre-approval in regards to both the nature and cost of such item. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2(e), Employee expressly agrees and acknowledges that (i) the maximum aggregate Gross Payments (including the gross amounts of the Net Payments) to be made by Company to Employee under all of the Relocation Allowance, the Travel Allowance, the Housing Allowance and the Closing Allowance shall be One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000), and (ii) if, within twenty-four (24) months of the date of this Agreement, Employee’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason except Good Reason (as defined in Section 3(d) of this Agreement), Employee shall repay a prorated share of the payments described herein based on a twenty-four (24) month proration formula.

As used in this Section 5, "Confidential Information" of the Company means all Intellectual Property Rights not available in the public domain, trade practices, business plans, price lists, supplier lists, customer lists, marketing plans, financial information, software and all other compilations of information which relate to the business of the Company, or to any of its subsidiaries, and which have not been disclosed by the Company to the public, or which are not otherwise generally available to the public.

The Employee acknowledges that the Confidential Information of the Company, as such may exist from time to time, are valuable, confidential, special and unique assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, expensive to produce and maintain and essential for the profitable operation of their respective businesses. The Employee agrees that, during the course of his employment with the Company, or at any time thereafter, he shall not, directly or indirectly, communicate, disclose or divulge to any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined), or use for his benefit or the benefit of any Person, in any manner, any Confidential Information of the Company or its subsidiaries acquired during his employment with the Company or any other confidential information concerning the conduct and details of the businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries, except as required in the course of his employment with the Company or as otherwise may be required by law. For purposes if this Agreement, “Person” shall mean any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, unincorporated association, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity or any government, governmental agency or political subdivision.

All documents relating to the businesses of the Company and its affiliates including, without limitation, Confidential Information of the Company, whether prepared by the Employee or otherwise coming into the Employee's possession, are the exclusive property of the Company and such respective subsidiaries, and must not be removed from the premises of the Company, except as required in the course of the Employee's employment with the Company. The Employee shall return all such documents (including any copies thereof) to the Company when the Employee ceases to be employed by the Company or upon the earlier request of the Company or the Board.

The Employee agrees not to disclose the terms of this Agreement to any other non-officer employee of the Company without the consent of the Chief Executive Officer.

b. 

Noncompetition  
  
During the Term of this Agreement (including any extensions thereof) and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of the Employee's employment under this Agreement for any reason, the Employee shall not, except with the Company's express prior written consent, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, for the benefit of any entity or person (including the Employee):

(i) Become employed by, own, operate, manage, direct, invest in (except investment through a mutual fund or ownership of less than 1% of the securities of a public company in competition with the Business), or otherwise, directly or indirectly, engage in, or be employed by, any entity or person which competes with the Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Territory.

6\. 

Reliance  
  
The Employee acknowledges that his compliance with the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Restrictive Covenants") is a material part of the consideration bargained for by the Company under this Agreement. The Employee agrees that such covenants are reasonable as to scope and duration and agrees to be bound by the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by law, it being the intent and spirit of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall be enforceable. However, the parties to this Agreement further agree that if any portion of the Restrictive Covenants or their application is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, then the other portions thereof and their application shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforceable. If the Restrictive Covenants shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographic scope, property, subject or similar factor, then the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce or limit such duration, geographic scope, property, subject or similar factors so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with applicable law, and the Restrictive Covenants shall then be enforceable in its reduced or limited form.

7\. 

Equitable Relief and Enforcement  
  
The Employee further acknowledges that any breach by him of the Restrictive Covenants will result in irreparable injury to the Company and its affiliates for which money damages could not adequately compensate the Company or such affiliates. In the event of any such breach (or threatened breach), the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies which it may have at law or in equity, to have an injunction issued by any competent court enjoining and restraining the Employee and all other persons involved therein from continuing such breach. The Company shall be entitled to such injunction without necessity of posting any bond, but if a bond is nonetheless required by the court entertaining the motion for the injunction, the parties to this Agreement agree that a bond in the amount of US$1,000 is appropriate. The existence of any claim or cause of action which the Employee or any such other Person may have against the Company shall not constitute a defense or bar to the enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants.

8\.
