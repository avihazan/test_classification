3\. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR BY QUANDT FOR GOOD REASON

3

* * *

##### 

Section 3(a), the grounds for such termination are cured as expressly permitted hereunder, the notice of termination shall be void and no termination pursuant to such notice shall occur. A non-extension of the Term, if elected by the Company, shall be deemed to be a termination of Quandt’s employment other than for Cause if Quandt remains employed until the end of the Term and his employment then in fact terminates due to the non-extension of the Term hereunder. 

(a) Notice and Payment Obligations. Any termination of Quandt’s employment by the Company other than for Cause shall only become effective at least 30 (thirty) days after written notice to Quandt from the Company. Any termination of employment by Quandt for Good Reason shall only become effective at least 30 (thirty) days after written notice to the Company from Quandt specifying the basis for his belief that he has Good Reason to terminate his employment. If the Company terminates the employment of Quandt other than for Cause and other than as a result of death or Permanent Disability (as defined hereinafter) or if Quandt terminates his employment for Good Reason (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall pay Quandt in full satisfaction of its obligations to him the following amounts: 

i. (A) The Base Salary accrued to the date of termination of employment, and (B) any amounts payable under all applicable Company plans or programs, determined pursuant to the terms of such plans or programs, such amounts to be paid in full on the first business day of the month following such termination (the amounts in Clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the “Accrued Amounts”); plus 

ii. A cash lump sum payment of pro rata Bonus, equal to the higher of the current year target amount (i.e. target amount being 55% of current year Base Salary) 

4

* * *

##### 

of Bonus payable to Quandt or the actual Bonus paid or payable for performance in the year prior to the year of termination, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from January 1 of the year of termination to the termination date and the denominator of which is 365 (but without duplication of any Bonus payout for the year of termination that is part of the Accrued Amounts), paid in full at the same date as payment is required under clause (i) above; plus 

iii. A cash lump sum payment in respect of vacation days accrued according to the Company’s rules to the date of termination that Quandt has not taken (the “Vacation Payment”), paid in full at the same date as payment is required under clause (i) above, or on such earlier date as may be required by law; plus 

iv. Payment for any unreimbursed Business Expenses, paid in full at the same date as payment is required under clause (i) above; plus 

v. An additional amount (the “Termination Amount”) equal to three times the sum of (a) Quandt’s Base Salary (calculated at the salary level in effect at the time of termination, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2(a)), plus (b) the higher of the current year target amount of Bonus payable to Quandt or the actual Bonus paid or payable for performance in the year prior to the year of termination, plus (c) an amount equal to the annual cost of medical plan benefits under COBRA or similar plan, payment of the Termination Amount being subject to the execution of a Release pursuant to Section 10. The Termination Amount (less applicable taxes) shall be payable in one lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination and receipt of the executed Release pursuant to Section 10; plus 

5

* * *

##### 

vi. Any amounts payable under the Noncompetition Agreement referenced in Section 6(b). 

(b) Definition of Good Reason. “Good Reason” shall mean (i) the failure of the Company to pay any amount due under this Agreement; (ii) a material breach of this Agreement by the Company; (iii) a meaningful diminution by the Company in the title, status, duties, powers, responsibilities or authority of Quandt; (iv) the failure of any successor to the Company (through merger or acquisition of assets or any other transaction that constitutes a Sale Event in which liabilities of the Company of this nature are to be assumed) to assume and fully perform all of the remaining obligations of the Company under this Agreement; or (v) the Company requires Quandt to be based at any office more than ten miles from White Plains, New York; provided, however, that none of the foregoing events or matters shall be deemed to constitute Good Reason if the Company has, prior to the date of termination, fully cured and corrected the event or matter that would have constituted Good Reason. In addition, Quandt may elect to terminate for “Good Reason” during the period of 3 (three) months that begins 6 (six) months after a transaction or series of transactions in which the persons who on the date of this Agreement beneficially owned the Common Stock of the Company, the Class A Preferred Stock of the Company, and the Class B Preferred Stock of the Company have, in the case of each such class of stock, ceased to beneficially own at least 50% of that class of stock and such persons, in the aggregate but regardless of whether acting as a group, no longer beneficially own securities of the Company that enable them to effectively control the Company through the power to elect at least 50% of the members of the Board of Directors (for this purpose, “beneficially own” and related terms shall

* * *

##### 

have the meaning ascribed to them under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). 

4\. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO PERMANENT DISABILITY OR DEATH

If Quandt shall be unable to perform the essential functions of his employment hereunder, with reasonable accommodation, because of illness, physical or mental disability or other incapacity for a period of 180 days in any 365 consecutive day period, or upon diagnosis of a permanent or complete disability (in either event, a “Permanent Disability”), the Company may terminate Quandt’s employment 30 days after written notice to Quandt if Quandt has not resumed the full-time performance of his duties before the end of such 30-day period. The existence of a Permanent Disability shall be determined by a medical doctor reasonably acceptable to the Company and to Quandt. Quandt’s employment shall end automatically upon Quandt’s death. Upon any termination for Permanent Disability or death, the Company shall pay Quandt or Quandt’s estate in full satisfaction of its obligations to him the Accrued Amounts, the Vacation Payment, any unreimbursed Business Expenses, and a cash lump sum payment of pro rata Bonus equal to the current year target amount of Bonus payable to Quandt multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from January 1 of the year of termination to the termination date and the denominator of which is 365 (but without duplication of any Bonus payout for the year of termination that is part of the Accrued Amounts). Payments under this Section 4 shall be made within 30 days after the termination event, and amounts payable under the Noncompetition Agreement referenced in Section 6(b) shall be payable in accordance with that Agreement.

5\. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY THE COMPANY FOR CAUSE OR BY QUANDT WITHOUT GOOD REASON 

The Company may terminate Quandt’s employment for Cause and Quandt may terminate his employment voluntarily without Good Reason, in each case subject to the notice requirement set forth in this Section 5. If, within such notice period, the grounds for termination by the Company for Cause are cured as expressly permitted hereunder, the notice of termination shall be void and no termination pursuant to such notice shall occur.

Payments under this Section 5 shall be made within 30 days after the termination date. In addition, the Company shall pay to Quandt any amounts payable under the Noncompetition Agreement referenced in Section 6(b) at the times specified in the Noncompetition Agreement.

(c) Notice of Termination. Termination of employment for Cause shall be made by delivering to Quandt a letter signed by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company, specifying, in factual detail, grounds for termination and providing Quandt with a 30-day period to cure such grounds if cure is possible. If cure is not effected, termination shall be effective at the end of the 30-day period, provided, however, that Quandt shall have the opportunity, if he so desires, to place the matter before the Board of Directors of the Company, by means of a personal appearance by him and his counsel, before such termination shall be effective. The Company and Quandt agree that they both are obligated to conduct the in-person meeting contemplated herein within 30 days of the notice of termination for Cause.

14\. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may only be amended by a written agreement signed by Quandt and the Company.

* * *

#####

18\. EFFECT ON PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes in all respects any prior or other agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, between the Company and Quandt with respect to Quandt’s employment. 

19\. TAX LAW COMPLIANCE.

(a) Compliance with Code Section 409A. In the event that, as a result of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) (and any related regulations or other pronouncements), any of the payments that Quandt is entitled to under the terms of this Agreement or any other plan or arrangement of the Company involving deferred compensation (as defined under Code Section 409A) may not be made at the time contemplated by the terms hereof or thereof without causing Quandt to be subject to constructive receipt of income at a date prior to actual payment or an income tax penalty or interest, and the timing of payment is the sole cause of such adverse tax consequences, the Company will make such payment on the earliest date thereafter that a distribution could be triggered under Code Section 409A without Quandt incurring such adverse tax consequences. In the case of any payment triggered by termination of employment hereunder, in the event of any delay in the payment date under this Section 19, the Company will adjust the payments to reflect the deferred payment date by crediting interest thereon at the prime rate in effect at the time such amount first would have been payable, as quoted by the Company’s principal lending bank. In addition, other provisions of this Agreement or any other such plan or arrangement notwithstanding, the 

15

* * *

##### 

Company shall have no right to accelerate or delay any such payment or to make any such payment as the result of any specific event except to the extent permitted under Section 409A without resulting in adverse tax consequences. 

(b) Golden Parachute Excise Tax. Other provisions of this Agreement the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any of the payments and benefits provided for under this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement between the Company and Quandt (collectively, the “Payments”) (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 19(b), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Payments shall be payable either (i) in full or (ii) as to such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such Payments being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code; whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes payable by Quandt and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 payable by Quandt, results in Quandt’s receipt on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of economic benefits under this Agreement, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless Quandt and the Company otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by independent advisors selected by the Company (the “Advisors”), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Quandt and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 19(b), the Advisors may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely in reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and 

16

* * *

##### 

Quandt shall furnish to the Advisors such information and documents as the Advisors may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 19(b). If this Section 19(b) is applied to reduce an amount payable to Quandt, and the Internal Revenue Service successfully asserts that, despite the reduction, Quandt has nonetheless received payments which are in excess of the maximum amount that could have been paid to him without being subjected to any excise tax, then, unless it would be unlawful for the Company to make such a loan or similar extension of credit to Quandt, Quandt may repay such excess amount to the Company as though such amount constitutes a loan to Quandt made at the date of payment of such excess amount, bearing interest at the prime rate of the Company’s principal lending bank. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement as of the date and year first above written.
