Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the Options shall immediately vest on the earlier of (i) subject to the discretion of the Committee, the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (as such term is defined in the Plan), or (ii) the date Optionee’s employment with the Company is terminated by reason of death, Total Disability or Retirement. In the event Colleague’s employment is terminated for any other reason, including retirement prior to age sixty-five with the approval of the Company or employing subsidiary, the Committee or its delegate, as appropriate, may, in the Committee’s or such delegate’s sole discretion, approve the vesting as to any or all Options still subject to vesting, such vesting to be effective on the date of such approval or Optionee’s termination date, if later.

3. Method of Exercise. The Option or any part thereof may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, sent directly to the Controller’s Department, which notice must state the number of full shares to be purchased, and must be accompanied by payment in full for the number of shares to be purchased. Subject to the Company’s Securities Trading Policy as may be in effect from time to time, such payment may be in cash, in shares of Stock, or in a broker-assisted same-day sale transaction or a combination thereof. If any part of such payment consists of Stock, such Stock must have been owned for at least six months and will be valued at the last sale price of such Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise. If Optionee’s notice is received by the Controller’s Office before 1:00 p.m (PT), the date of exercise of the Option, will be the date of receipt by the Controller’s Office. The exercise date for notices received after 1:00 p.m. (PT) will be the business day following the date of receipt by the Controller’s Office. Not less than 100 shares may be purchased at any one time unless the shares purchased are all of the shares then purchasable under the Option.

The Company will issue and deliver to Optionee a certificate for the number of shares purchased; provided, however, that if any federal or state law or regulation of any securities exchange listing the Company’s shares requires the Company to take any action with respect to the exercised share before issuance thereof, then the date for issuance and delivery of such shares will be extended for the period of time necessary to take such action.

4. Withholding of Tax. The exercise of Non-Qualified Stock Options may result in income to you for federal or state tax purposes. To the extent that you become subject to taxation, you shall deliver to the Company at the time of such exercise such amount of money or shares of unrestricted Stock, as the Company may require to meet its withholding obligation under applicable tax laws or regulations. If you fail to do so, the Company is authorized to withhold from any cash or stock remuneration then or thereafter payable to you any tax required to be withheld by reason of such resulting compensation income. If you exercise Stock Options through a cashless transaction, taxes will be withheld from the proceeds of the sale of Shares. Your delivery of Shares to meet the tax withholding obligation is subject to the Company’s Securities Trading Policy as may be in effect from time to time. You must have owned any stock you deliver for at least six months. Any Stock you deliver or which is withheld by the Company will be valued on the date of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Any fractional shares of stock resulting from withholding of taxes will be paid to you in cash.

5. Expiration of Options after Termination. Stock Options and all rights granted under this Agreement, to the extent such rights have not been exercised, will terminate on the earlier of the Termination Date or the earliest to occur of the following:

5.1 Immediately upon termination of Optionee’s employment for cause, as determined by the Committee.

Termination of Optionee’s employment with the Company to accept employment with a subsidiary of the Company, or vice versa or to go on leave of absence at the request, or with the approval, of the Company will not be deemed a termination of employment for the for the purpose of this paragraph. In the event of termination of employment under subparagraph 5.2 above, Optionee may exercise the Option only to the extent vested under paragraph 2 above on the date of termination.

Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee, or its delegate, as appropriate, and its determination shall be final.

The Plan and this Agreement shall not constitute a contract of employment between the Company, any successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company or any successor corporation and Optionee. Each Optionee is an at-will employee except as provided in any other written agreement. Nothing contained in the Plan (or any Award made pursuant to this Plan) or the Agreement shall confer upon Optionee any right to continue in the employment of the Company, or guarantee of payment of future incentives, or shall interfere with, affect or restrict in any way, the rights of the Company, which are expressly reserved, to discharge Optionee, any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

8. Availability of Plan/Plan Incorporated. Optionee acknowledges that Company has made available to Optionee a copy of the Plan and agrees that this Award of Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, including future amendments thereto, if any, pursuant to the terms thereof, which Plan is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement.
