6\. Change in Control. Immediately prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), all of the shares of Restricted Stock (that have not yet vested pursuant to Sections 3 or 5 hereof) shall vest immediately and shall no longer be subject to cancellation pursuant to Section 4 or the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 7 of this Award Agreement. 

7\. Nontransferability of Restricted Stock. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Restricted Stock may not be transferred, pledged, alienated, assigned or otherwise attorned other than by last will and testament or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Committee may, subject to such terms and conditions as it shall specify, permit the transfer of the Restricted Stock, including, without limitation, for no consideration to a charitable institution or a Permitted Transferee. Any shares of Restricted Stock transferred to a charitable institution may not be further transferable without the Committee’s approval and any shares of Restricted Stock transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall be further transferable only by last will and testament or the laws of descent and distribution or, for no consideration, to another Permitted Transferee of the Participant.

8\. Rights as a Stockholder. The Participant shall have, with respect to the Restricted Stock, all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including, if applicable, the right to vote the Restricted Stock and to receive any dividends or other distributions, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Plan and this Award Agreement.

9\. Dividends and Distributions. Any cash, Common Stock or other securities of the Company or other consideration received by the Participant as a result of a distribution to holders of Restricted Stock or as a dividend on the Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock, and all references to Restricted Stock hereunder shall be deemed to include such cash, Common Stock or other securities or consideration.

10\. Legend on Certificates. The Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on certificates representing the Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock to make appropriate reference to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or as may be required by the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any exchange that lists the Common Stock, and any applicable federal or state laws.

11\. Conditions to Delivery of Common Stock Certificates. The Company shall not be required to deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:

(a) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency which the Committee determines to be necessary or advisable; and

12\. Physical Custody. The Restricted Stock may be issued in certificate form or electronically in “book entry”. The Secretary of the Company or such other representative as the Committee may appoint shall retain physical custody of each certificate representing the Restricted Stock until all of the restrictions imposed under this Award Agreement with respect to the shares evidenced by such certificate expire or are removed. In no event shall the Participant retain physical custody of any certificates representing unvested Restricted Stock assigned to Participant.

13\. No Entitlements.

(a) No Right to Continued Employment. This award is not an employment agreement, and nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan shall (i) alter the Participant’s status as an “at-will” employee of the Company, (ii) be construed as guaranteeing the Participant’s employment by the Company or as giving the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company during any period (including without limitation the period between the Date Of Grant and the applicable vesting date in accordance with Section 3) or (iii) be construed as giving the Participant any right to be reemployed by the Company following any termination of Employment.

(b) No Right to Future Awards. This award of Restricted Stock and all other equity-based awards under the Plan are discretionary. This award does not confer on the Participant any right or entitlement to receive another award of Restricted Stock or any other equity-based award at any time in the future or in respect of any future period.

(c) No Effect on Future Employment Compensation. The Company has made this award of Restricted Stock to the Participant in its sole discretion. This award does not confer on the Participant any right or entitlement to receive compensation in any specific amount for any future fiscal year, and does not diminish in any way the Company’s discretion to determine the amount, if any, of the Participant’s compensation. In addition, this award of Restricted Stock is not part of the Participant’s base salary or wages and will not be taken into account in determining any other employment-related rights the Participant may have, such as rights to pension or severance pay.

14\. Taxes and Withholding. No later than the date as of which an amount with respect to the Restricted Stock first becomes includable in the gross income of the Participant for applicable income tax purposes, the Participant shall pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee, the minimum required withholding obligations may be settled in Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of the award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company to deliver the certificates for shares of Common Stock under this Award Agreement shall be conditional upon such payment or arrangements and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant, including, without limitation, by withholding shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon vesting.

They supersede all other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied) that relate to the subject matter hereof.

(e) Amendments. The Board or the Committee shall have the power to alter, amend, modify or terminate the Plan or this Award Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such termination, amendment or modification may adversely affect, in any material respect, the Participant’s rights under this Award Agreement without the Participant’s consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have broad authority to amend this Award Agreement without the consent of the Participant to the extent it deems necessary or desirable (i) to comply with or take into account changes in or interpretations of, applicable tax laws, securities laws, employment laws, accounting rules and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, (ii) to ensure that the Restricted Stock is not subject to taxes, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, (iii) to take into account unusual or nonrecurring events or market conditions, or (iv) to take into account significant acquisitions or dispositions of assets or other property by the Company.

The Committee shall give written notice to the Participant in accordance with Section 16(a) of any such amendment, modification or termination as promptly as practicable after the adoption thereof. The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the Participant and the Company by mutual consent to alter or amend the terms of the Restricted Stock in any manner that is consistent with the Plan and approved by the Committee.
