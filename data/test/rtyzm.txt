THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET, INC. 



RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) dated as of January 25, 2005 (the “Date of Grant”), between The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and «First» «Last» (the “Participant”): 

R E C I T A L S: 

The Company has adopted The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which Plan is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. 

The Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to grant the restricted stock award provided for herein to the Participant pursuant to the Plan and the terms set forth herein as an increased incentive for the Participant to contribute to the Company’s future success and prosperity. 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1. Grant of the Restricted Shares.   
  
(a)

The Company hereby grants to the Participant an Award (the “Award”) of «RSAs» Shares of restricted stock (the “Restricted Shares”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Subject to Section 3 hereof, the Restricted Shares shall be registered in the name of the Participant on the stock transfer books of the Company. However, any certificates issued with respect to Restricted Shares shall be held by the Company in escrow under the terms hereof, provided, that, unless the Company determines otherwise, no such certificates shall be issued prior to the date determined under Section 6(b) hereof. Any such certificates shall bear the legend set forth in Section 1(b) below or such other appropriate legend as the Committee shall determine, which legend shall be removed only on and after the date determined under Section 6(b) and if and when the Restricted Shares have become vested Restricted Shares (as defined in Section 2(a) hereof). As a condition to the issuance of Shares pursuant to this Award, the Participant shall deliver to the Company stock powers substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A duly endorsed in blank. The Participant shall be entitled to vote all Restricted Shares, and shall be entitled to receive, free of all restrictions, ordinary cash dividends and dividends in the form of Shares thereon if any. The Participant’s right to receive any extraordinary dividends or other distributions with respect to Restricted Shares prior to their becoming vested Restricted Shares shall be at the sole discretion of the Committee, but in the event of any such extraordinary dividends or distributions are paid to the holders of Company Shares, the

Committee shall take such action as may be appropriate to preserve the value of, and prevent the unintended enhancement of the value of, the Restricted Shares.   
  
(b) Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any certificate issued in respect of the Restricted Shares shall bear the following legend:   
  
“This certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions, including forfeiture provisions and restrictions against transfer (the “Restrictions”), contained in The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan and an agreement entered into between the registered owner and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Any attempt to dispose of these shares in contravention of the applicable restrictions, including by way of sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or otherwise, shall be null, void and without effect.”

3. Termination of Employment.   
  
(a) If, prior to the Measurement Date, the Company terminates the Participant’s employment with the Company for any reason or the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason, all Restricted Shares shall be canceled and forfeited effective as of the date of such termination without further consideration to the Participant.   
  
(b) If the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the termination of all transfer restrictions applicable to the Shares imposed by Section 6(b) hereof, the Company shall have the right and option (the “Repurchase Right”), but not the obligation, to purchase from the Participant any and all vested Restricted Shares, on any date selected by the Company during the 30-day period commencing on the later of (i) the date of such termination of employment or (ii) the date that is six months following the date such Restricted Shares became vested Restricted Shares.

Upon its receipt of such vested Restricted Shares, the Company shall pay the Participant the aggregate Repurchase Price. The aggregate Repurchase Price may be payable, at the option of the Company, in cancellation of all or a portion of the any outstanding indebtedness of the Participant to the Company, or in cash (by check) or both.   
  
(iii) If the Company delivers a Repurchase Notice as to any vested Restricted Shares, then from and after the time of delivery of the Repurchase Notice (A) the Participant shall no longer have any rights as a holder of the vested Restricted Shares subject thereto (other than the right to receive payment of the Repurchase Price in accordance with this Section 3(c)) and (B) such vested Restricted Shares shall be deemed purchased in accordance with the applicable provisions hereof and the Company shall be deemed to be the owner and holder of such vested Restricted Shares.

4. Change in Control. Upon a Change in Control, all Restricted Shares that would otherwise have become vested Restricted Shares on or prior to the first anniversary of the Change in Control had the Participant remained in the employ of the Company during such one-year period shall become vested Restricted Shares; provided however, that in the event that the Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company other than for Cause within such one-year period following the Change in Control, all Restricted Shares granted to the Participant hereunder shall become vested Restricted Shares.   
  
5. No Right to Continued Employment. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall confer on the Participant any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee, consultant or director of the Company.

(b) In order to comply with any applicable securities laws, the Participant agrees that the Restricted Shares shall only be sold by the Participant following registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom.   
  
7. Withholding. The Participant shall pay to the Company promptly upon request, and in any event at the time the Participant recognizes taxable income in respect of the Restricted Shares, an amount equal to the taxes the Company determines it is required to withhold under applicable tax laws with respect to the Restricted Shares. Such payment shall be made in the form of cash, Shares already owned for at least six months, delivering to the Company a portion of the Restricted Shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum withholding required with respect thereto to the extent permitted by the Company, or in a combination of such methods, as irrevocably elected by the Participant prior to the applicable tax due date with respect to such Restricted Shares. The Participant shall promptly notify the Company of any election made pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code and shall provide the Company with a copy of such election.

11. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of the Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
