Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 7(b) of the Plan.

(d) Death or Termination of Service of Optionee. The following provisions shall govern the exercise period applicable to any Options held by an Optionee at the time of his or her death or termination of service with the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company: 

(i) Termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant. In the event of termination of an Optionee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant (as the case may be) for any reason other than Optionee’s death, Disability or Misconduct, such Optionee may only exercise the Option within three (3) months (or such shorter period as specified in the written option agreement) after the date of such termination. 

(ii) Disability of Optionee. In the event of termination of an Optionee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of the Optionee’s Disability, the Optionee may only exercise the Option within twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as is specified in the written option agreement) from the date of such termination. 

(iii) Death of Optionee. In the event of termination of an Optionee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of the Optionee’s death, the Option may only be exercised any time within twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as is specified in the written option agreement) following the date of death by the Optionee’s estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance. 

(iv) Limitations. Each Option shall, during the limited exercise period under this Section 8(d), be exercisable only as to the Shares for which the Option is exercisable on the date of the Optionee’s death or termination of service with the Company. Under no circumstances shall any Option become exercisable under this Section 8(d) after the Option Termination Date. Upon the earlier of the expiration of such limited exercise period or the Option Termination Date, the Option shall terminate and cease to be exercisable. 

(v) Immediate Termination. Should the Optionee’s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant be terminated for Misconduct, then in any such event all outstanding Options granted to the Optionee under this Plan shall terminate immediately and cease to be exercisable. 

(vi) Board Discretion to Accelerate. The Board shall have complete discretion, exercisable either at the time the Option is granted or at any time the Option remains outstanding, to permit one or more Options granted under this Plan to be exercised during the limited exercise period applicable under this Section 8(d), not only for the number of Shares for which each such Option is exercisable at the time of the Optionee’s death or termination of service but also for one or more subsequent installments of Shares for which the Option would otherwise have become exercisable had such death or termination of service not occurred. 

(e) Extensions. Notwithstanding the provisions covering the exercisability of Options following death or termination of service, as described in Section 8(d), the Board may, in its sole discretion, with the consent of the Optionee or the Optionee’s estate (in the case of the 

5 

* * *

death of Optionee), extend the period of time during which the Option shall remain exercisable, provided that in no event shall such extension go beyond the Option Termination Date. 

9\. Restrictions on Grants of Options and Issuance of Shares. 

(a) Regulatory Approvals. No Shares shall be issued or delivered upon exercise of an Option unless and until there shall have been compliance with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “1933 Act”), and any other requirement of law or of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery. The inability of the Company to obtain any required permits, authorizations or approvals necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder on terms deemed reasonable by the Board shall relieve the Company, the Board, and any Committee of any liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of such Shares as to which such requisite permits, authorizations, or approvals shall not have been obtained. 

(b) Representations and Warranties. As a condition to the granting or exercise of any Option, the Board may require the person receiving or exercising such Option to make any representation and/or warranty to the Company as may be required (or deemed appropriate by the Board, in its discretion) under any applicable law or regulation, including but not limited to a representation that the Option and/or Shares are being acquired only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Option and/or Shares, if such a representation is required under the 1933 Act or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation. 

10\. Option Adjustments. 

(a) Change in Capitalization. If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of the Company through reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or reverse stock split, upon authorization by the Board an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made in the number or kind of shares, and the per-share option price thereof, which may be issued in the aggregate and to any individual Optionees under the Plan upon exercise of Options granted under the Plan; provided, however, that no such adjustment need be made if, upon the advice of counsel, the Board determines that such adjustment may result in the receipt of federal taxable income to holders of Options granted under the Plan or the holders of Common Stock or other classes of the Company’s securities. 

(b) Corporate Reorganizations. Upon the occurrence of a Terminating Transaction, as of the effective date of such Terminating Transaction, the Plan and any then outstanding Options (whether or not vested) shall terminate unless (i) provision is made in writing in connection with such transaction for the continuance of the Plan and for the assumption of such Options, or for the substitution for such Options of new options covering the securities of a successor corporation or an affiliate thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of securities and exercise prices, in which event the Plan and such outstanding Options shall continue or be replaced, as the case may be, in the manner and under the terms so provided; or (ii) the Board otherwise shall provide in writing for such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the terms and conditions of the then-outstanding Options (whether or not vested), including without limitation providing for the cancellation of Options and their automatic 

6 

* * *

conversion into the right to receive the securities or other properties which a holder of the Shares underlying such Options would have been entitled to receive upon such Terminating Transaction had such Shares been issued and outstanding (net of the appropriate option exercise prices). If, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b), the Plan and the Options shall terminate by reason of the occurrence of a Terminating Transaction without provision for any of the action(s) described in clause (i) or (ii) hereof, then any Optionee holding outstanding Options shall have the right, at such time immediately prior to the consummation of the Terminating Transaction as the Board shall designate, to exercise his or her Options to the full extent not theretofore exercised, including any portion which has not yet become exercisable. 

11\. Option Agreement. The terms and conditions of Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written option agreement executed by the Company and the person to whom the Option is granted. Each option agreement shall incorporate the Plan by reference and shall include such provisions as are determined to be necessary or appropriate by the Board. The provisions of various option agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 

12\. Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Board may amend, suspend, alter, or terminate the Plan at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect Options granted on or prior to the date thereof, as evidenced by the execution of an option agreement by both the Company and the Optionee, without the consent of such Optionee. 

13\. Limited Transferability of Options. Options may, to the extent permitted by the Board, be assigned in whole or in part during the Optionee’s lifetime (i) as a gift to one or more members of the Optionee’s immediate family, to a trust in which Optionee and/or one or more such family members hold more than fifty percent (50%) of the beneficial interest or to an entity in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests are owned by one or more such family members or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Board may deem appropriate. Except as set forth in this Section 13, Options granted under this Plan may not be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, encumbered, gifted or otherwise transferred or alienated in any manner, either voluntarily or involuntarily by operation of law, other than by will or the laws of descent or distribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of an Optionee only by such Optionee. 

14\. No Rights in Shares Before Issuance and Delivery. Neither the Optionee, his or her estate nor his or her transferees by will or the laws of descent and distribution shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued and delivered notwithstanding exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other rights where the record date is prior to the date such stock certificates are issued, except as provided in Section 10. 

15\. Taxes. The Board shall make such provisions and take such steps as it deems necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any federal, state, local and other tax required by law to be withheld with respect to the grant or exercise of an Option under the Plan, including, without limitation, the deduction of the amount of any such withholding tax from any 

7 

* * *

compensation or other amounts payable to an Optionee by the Company, or requiring an Optionee (or the Optionee’s beneficiary or legal representative) as a condition of granting or exercising an Option to pay to the Company any amount required to be withheld, or to execute such other documents as the Board deems necessary or desirable in connection with the satisfaction of any applicable withholding obligation. In the discretion of the Board, upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee may request the Company to withhold from the Shares to be issued upon such exercise that number of Shares (based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the day notice of exercise is received by the Company) that would satisfy any tax withholding requirement. 

16\. Legends on Options and Stock Certificates. Each option agreement and each certificate representing Shares acquired upon exercise of an Option shall be endorsed with all legends, if any, required by applicable federal and state securities laws to be placed on the option agreement and/or the certificate. The Board shall make the determination of which legends, if any, shall be placed upon option agreements and/or the certificates representing Shares in its sole discretion and such decision shall be final and binding. 

17\. Availability of Plan and Financial Statements. A copy of this Plan shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company and shall be shown by the Secretary to any eligible person making reasonable inquiry concerning the Plan. 

18\. Applicable Law. This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without resort to that state’s conflict-of-laws rules. 

Date Plan approved by Board: October 10, 2001.
