(a) At-Will Employment. Executive’s employment shall be “at will”, and nothing herein shall prevent either party from terminating Executive’s employment. Any termination of Executive’s employment by the Company or by Executive shall be communicated by written notice to the other party hereto in accordance herewith. In the event of any termination of Executive’s employment, the Company shall pay to Executive all accrued and unpaid compensation in accordance with applicable law and the terms of any Company plan. 

(b) Involuntary Termination Benefits. If Executive’s employment is terminated (i) by Executive for Good Reason within 24 months after the Effective Date or within 24 months after a Change in Control or (ii) by the Company without Cause at any time, and Executive remains in compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below), Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits in exchange for Executive’s general release of claims in a form acceptable to the Company: 

(i) The Company shall pay Executive, in a lump sum as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days following the date of termination, an amount equal to 1.5 times Executive’s Annual Base Salary; provided that to the extent that the Company in good faith determines that any payment provided for in this Section constitutes a “deferral of compensation” under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), then no amount shall be payable to Executive prior to the earliest of: (A) Executive’s death or “disability” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) following the date of termination; (B) the date that is 6 months following the date of termination; or (C) a Change in Control (to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code).
