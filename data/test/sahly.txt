11\. Confidential Information. The parties hereto recognize that it is fundamental to the business and operation of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof to preserve the specialized knowledge, trade secrets, and confidential information of the foregoing concerning the field of advertising, marketing and sports/entertainment management. The strength and good-will of the Company is derived from the specialized knowledge, trade secrets, and confidential information generated from experience through the activities undertaken by the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof. The disclosure of any of such information and the knowledge thereof on the part of competitors would be beneficial to such competitors and detrimental to the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof, as would the disclosure of information about the marketing practices, pricing practices, costs, profit margins, design specifications, analytical techniques, concepts, ideas, process developments (whether or not patentable), customer and client agreements, vendor and supplier agreements and similar items or technologies. By reason of his being an employee of the Company, in the course of his employment, the Employee has or shall have access to, and has obtained or shall obtain, specialized knowledge, trade secrets and confidential information such as that described herein about the business and operation of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof. Therefore, the Employee hereby agrees as follows, recognizing and acknowledging that the Company is relying on the following in entering into this Agreement:

* * *

(a) The Employee hereby sells, transfers and assigns to the Company, or to any person or entity designated by the Company, any and all right, title and interest of the Employee in and to all creations, designs, inventions, ideas, disclosures and improvements, whether patented or unpatented, and copyrightable material, made or conceived by the Employee solely or jointly, in whole or in part, during the term hereof (commencing with the date of the Employee’s employment with the Company) which: (i) relate to methods, apparatus, designs, products, processes or devices created, promoted, marketed, distributed, sold, leased, used, developed, relied upon or otherwise provided by the Company or any affiliate, subsidiary or division thereof; or (ii) otherwise relate to or pertain to the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any affiliate, subsidiary or division thereof. Whether during the Period of Employment or thereafter, the Employee shall execute and deliver to the Company such formal transfers and assignments and such other papers and documents as may be required of the Employee to permit the Company or any person or entity designated by the Company to file, enforce and prosecute the patent applications relating to any of the foregoing and, as to copyrightable material, to obtain copyright thereon; and

(b) Notwithstanding any earlier termination, the Employee shall, except as otherwise required or compelled by law, keep secret and retain in strict confidence, and shall not use, disclose to others, or publish any information, other than information which is in the public domain or becomes publicly available through no wrongful act on the part of the Employee, which information shall be deemed not to be confidential information, relating to the business, operation or other affairs of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof including but not limited to confidential information concerning the design and marketing practices, pricing practices, costs, profit margins, products, methods, guidelines, procedures, engineering designs and standards, design specifications, analytical techniques, technical information, customer, client, vendor or supplier information, employee information, and any and all other confidential information acquired by him in the course of his past or future services for the Company or any affiliate, subsidiary or division thereof. The Employee shall hold as the Company’s property all notes, memoranda, books, records, papers, letters, formulas and other data and all copies thereof and therefrom in any way relating to the business, operation or other affairs of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof whether made by him or otherwise coming into his possession. Upon termination of his employment or upon the demand of the Company, at any time, the Employee shall deliver the same to the Company within five (5) business days of such termination or demand.

12\. Reasonableness of Restrictions. The Employee hereby agrees that the restrictions in this Agreement, including without limitation, those relating to the duration of the provisions hereof and the territory to which such restrictions apply, are necessary and fundamental to the protection of the business and operation of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions thereof and are reasonable and valid. In addition, the Employee acknowledges that he has agreed to such restrictions voluntarily.

13\. Reformation of Certain Provisions. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the non-compete or the confidentiality provisions hereof are unreasonably broad or otherwise unenforceable because of the length of their respective terms or the breadth of their territorial scope, or for any other reason, the parties hereto agree that such court may reform the terms and/or scope of such covenants so that the same are reasonable and, as reformed, shall be enforceable.

14\. Remedies. Subject to Section 15 below, in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall provide written notice of such breach to the breaching party. The breaching party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice in which to cure its breach. If, on the thirty-first (3lst) day after receipt of such notice, the breaching party shall have failed to cure such breach, the non-breaching party thereafter shall be entitled to seek damages. It is acknowledged that this Agreement is of a unique nature and of extraordinary value and of such a character that a breach hereof by the Employee shall result in irreparable damage and injury to the Company for which the Company may not have any adequate remedy at law. Therefore, if on the thirty-first (31st) day after receipt of such notice, the breaching party shall have failed to cure such breach, the non-breaching party shall also be entitled to seek a decree of specific performance against the breaching party, or such other relief by way of restraining order, injunction or otherwise as may be appropriate to ensure compliance with this Agreement. The remedies provided by this section are non-exclusive and the pursuit of such remedies shall not in any way limit any other remedy available to the parties with respect to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any remedy available at law or equity with respect to any anticipatory or threatened breach of the provisions hereof.

15\. Certain Provisions; Specific Performance. In the event of a breach by the Employee of the non-competition or confidentiality provisions hereof, such breach shall not be subject to any cure provision hereof and the Company shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief and a decree of specific performance against the Employee. Such remedy is non-exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the Company or any affiliate, subsidiary or division thereof may be entitled.

16\. Consolidation; Merger; Sale of Assets. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from combining, consolidating or merging with or into, transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, or entering into a partnership or joint venture with, another corporation or other entity, or electing any other kind of corporate combination, provided that, the corporation resulting from or surviving such combination, consolidation or merger, or to which such assets are transferred, or such partnership or joint venture (each a “Successor in Interest”) assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings of the Company hereunder. Upon such a consolidation, merger, transfer of assets or formation of such partnership or joint venture, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be assumed by, and be binding upon such Successor in Interest. The term “Company,” as used in this Agreement, shall be deemed to include such Successor in Interest and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall entitle the Employee and his heirs, beneficiaries and representatives to exactly the same compensation, benefits, perquisites, payments and other rights as would have been their entitlement had such combination, consolidation, merger, transfer of assets or formation of such partnership or joint venture not occurred.

17\. Survival. Sections 10 through 15 shall survive the termination for any reason of this Agreement (whether such termination is by the Company, by the Employee, upon the expiration of this Agreement by its terms or otherwise).

18\. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be considered severable in the event that any of such provisions are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable. Such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions shall be automatically replaced by other provisions which are valid and enforceable and which are as similar as possible in term and intent to those provisions deemed to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the remaining provisions hereof shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
