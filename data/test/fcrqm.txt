ARTICLE II. 

AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 

2.1 Award of Restricted Stock Units. 

(a) Award. In consideration of Holder’s continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company hereby grants to Holder the right to receive the number of RSUs set forth in the Grant Notice, subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Grant Notice and the Plan. Prior to actual issuance of any Shares, the RSUs and the Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 

(b) Vesting. The RSUs subject to the Award shall vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. Unless and until the RSUs have vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice, Holder will have no right to any distribution with respect to such RSUs. In the event of Holder’s Termination of Service prior to the vesting of all of the RSUs, any unvested RSUs will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company. 

(c) Distribution of Shares. 

(i) Shares of Common Stock shall be distributed to Holder (or in the event of Holder’s death, to his or her estate) with respect to such Holder’s vested RSUs within thirty (30) days following the vesting date of the RSUs as specified in the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Grant Notice, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

(ii) All distributions shall be made by the Company in the form of whole shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Neither the time nor form of distribution of Common Stock with respect to the RSUs may be changed, except as may be permitted by the Administrator in accordance with the Plan and Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 

(d) Generally. Shares issued under the Award shall be issued to Holder or Holder’s beneficiaries, as the case may be, at the sole discretion of the Administrator, in either (i) uncertificated form, with the Shares recorded in the name of Holder in the books and records of the Company’s transfer agent with appropriate notations regarding the restrictions on transfer imposed pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) certificate form. In no event will fractional shares be issued upon settlement of the Award. All distributions shall be made by the Company in the form of whole Shares. In lieu of any fractional Share, the Company shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share on the date the RSUs are settled pursuant to this Section 2.1. 

2.2 Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.1(b) hereof), the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any certificate representing Shares issuable with respect to the RSUs to Holder or his or her legal representative unless and until Holder or his or her legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state, local and foreign taxes applicable with respect to the taxable income of Holder resulting from the grant or vesting of the RSUs, the distribution of the Shares issuable with respect thereto, or any other taxable event related to the RSUs (the “Tax Withholding Obligation”). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Company has the authority to deduct or withhold, or require Holder to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation with respect to any taxable event arising from the vesting of the RSUs or the receipt of the Shares upon settlement of the RSUs. 

2.3 Conditions to Issuance of Stock Certificates. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares upon settlement of the RSUs prior to fulfillment of all of the conditions set forth in Section 11.4 of the Plan.

This Award and the rights and privileges conferred hereby, including the RSUs awarded hereunder, shall not be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of Holder or his or her successors in interest and shall not be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence.

4.8 Tax Representations. Holder has reviewed with Holder’s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by the Grant Notice and this Agreement. Holder is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. Holder understands that Holder (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Holder’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

4.9 Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.
