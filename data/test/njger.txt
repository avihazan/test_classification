The parties to this Loan Agreement ("Agreement") are MOODY NATIONAL BANK, a national banking association, of Galveston, Galveston County, Texas (hereinafter called "Bank"), and NATIONAL WESTERN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, a Colorado insurance corporation (hereinafter called "Borrower").

  


This Loan Agreement has reference to that one certain revolving credit loan ("Loan") in the maximum principal amount of $40,000,000.00 or so much thereof as advanced, of even date herewith from Bank to Borrower.

  


WHEREAS, Borrower has made and delivered a $40,000,000.00 or so much thereof as may be advanced Revolving Credit Promissory Note (the "Note") to Bank; and

  


WHEREAS, the making of such loan is based on various additional agreements of the parties hereto as provided in this Agreement and in that certain security agreement-pledge-collateral assignment of even date herewith between Borrower as Pledgor and Bank as Secured Party ("Security Agreement") which is incorporated herein by this reference; and

  


WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement wish to set forth herein the following additional agreements.

  


NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED BY AND BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO AS FOLLOWS:

  


1.

Advances:  
  
(a) Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of each advance of funds under the Note ("Advance") requested by the Borrower and made by the Bank shall be used by the Borrower solely for working capital purposes, including repayment of outstanding advances, but specifically excluding capital expenditures. Each request by the Borrower for an Advance shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the proceeds of the Advance will be used solely for the purposes required by this Section. As a condition precedent to the obligation of the Bank to make any such Advance, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank such schedules, certificates, invoices, affidavits, and other documents as the Bank may require to satisfy itself with respect to the requirements hereof.  
  
(b) Procedures for Advance. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Note and Security Agreement, and to other provisions contained herein, and provided that no breach or event of default has then occurred under the Note, Security Agreement, this Agreement, or any other document executed in connection with the Loan (collectively, "Loan Documents"), advances under the Note may be requested by Borrower from and after the date of the Note ("Closing Date") up to the date which is the Third (3rd) Anniversary of the Note ("Maturity Date"). Advances shall be in minimum amounts of $1,000,000.00 and in increments thereof, but in no event greater than the lesser of (i) $40,000,000.00, or (ii) an amount equal to 95% of the then-current market value of all "Qualified Assets" (as defined in the Security Agreement) then securing the Note ("Revolving Credit Amount"), when aggregated with all amounts then outstanding under the Note. All such requests shall be required to be requested by written request on behalf of Borrower, signed by any one of the following listed individuals, specimens of whose signatures Borrower agrees to tender to Bank upon request, containing the amount requested to be advanced and the instructions for disbursement of the funds the advance of which is so being requested:  
  
1\. Brian M. Pribyl  
  
2\. Michael G. Kean

(iii) No event shall have occurred and then be continuing (or would occur after giving effect to the requested Advance) which constitutes (or would constitute after giving effect to the Advance) an event of default or potential default under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents and a certificate to such effect and speaking as of the date thereof (and not as of some future date) and signed by the President or a Vice President of the Borrower shall be delivered to the Bank.  
  
(iv) Each and all of the representations and warranties of the Borrower in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true, correct and accurate as of the Closing Date and as of the date any Advance of the Revolving Credit under the Note is requested and a certificate to such effect signed by the President or a Vice President of the Borrower shall be delivered to the Bank.  
  
(v) The Borrower shall have duly and timely performed each and all of its agreements and undertakings contained in this Agreement and all other Loan Documents.  
  
(vi) The Bank shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that the Pledged Securities are all owned by the Borrower free and clear of any impediments; and the Bank's security interest in and pledge of the Pledged Securities is fully perfected and registered.  
  
(d) Sole Benefit of Bank. All conditions precedent to the obligation of the Bank to make the Advances are imposed hereby solely for the benefit of the Bank and no other party may require satisfaction of any such condition precedent or be entitled to assume that the Bank will refuse to make the Advances in the absence of strict compliance with such conditions precedent. Any requirement of this Agreement may be waived by the Bank, in whole or in part, at any time. Any requirement herein of submission of evidence of the existence or non-existence of a fact shall be deemed, also, to be a requirement that the fact shall exist or not exist, as the case may be, and without waiving any condition or obligation of the Borrower, the Bank may at all times independently establish to its satisfaction such existence or non-existence.  
  
(e) No Obligation to Make Advance. No Advances need be made by the Bank if such advance should cause the Bank to be, in the sole opinion of Bank, in violation of any law, rule, regulation or interpretation of a governmental body applicable to the Bank. Borrower shall receive a refund on a pro rata basis for the Commitment Fee, as that term is defined in this Loan Agreement, in the event and to the extent Bank is unable to make an advance or Borrower is required to make a principal reduction, by reason of the foregoing sentence.

(f) Role of Bank. Any term or condition hereof, or of any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Bank shall not have, and by its execution and acceptance of this Agreement hereby expressly disclaim, any obligation or responsibility for the management, conduct or operation of the business and affairs of the Borrower. Any term or condition hereof, or of any of the other Loan Documents, permitting the Bank to disburse funds, whether from the proceeds of the Note, or otherwise, or to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to the Borrower, the Collateral or any other security for repayment of the Loan, shall be deemed to be solely to permit the Bank to audit and review the management, operation and conduct of the business and affairs of the Borrower, and to maintain and preserve the security given by the Borrower to the Bank for the Loan and may not be relied upon by any other person. Further, the Bank shall not have, has not assumed and, by its execution and acceptance of this Agreement, hereby expressly disclaims any liability or obligation of the Borrower, and no condition hereof, or of any of the other Loan Documents, shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between the Borrower and the Bank to be other than that of borrower and lender, and the Borrower shall at all times represent that the relationship between the Borrower and the Bank is solely that of borrower and lender. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold the Bank harmless from and against any costs, expenses and liabilities incurred or suffered by the Bank as a result of any assertion or claim of any obligation or responsibility of the Bank for the management, operation and conduct of the business and affairs of the Borrower, or as a result of any assertion or claim of any liability or responsibility of the Bank for the payment or performances of any indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower, except to the extent any such assertion or claim results from the negligence or willful misconduct of Bank.  
  
2.

(a) Commitment Fee. Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment fee for making available the Revolving Credit Amount at the rate of one-tenth of one percent (.1%) per annum of the daily average unfunded portion of the Revolving Credit Amount from the Closing Date to the Maturity Date. The commitment fee shall be non-refundable and shall be paid in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on the Maturity Date.  
  
3.

(b) Each such statement shall be certified by Borrower as being true, complete and correct, and shall be in a form acceptable to Bank, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  
  
4.

Without Bank's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Borrower will not create, assume or suffer to exist with respect to the securities pledged to the Bank under the Loan Documents, any indebtedness or other liability, direct or indirect, whether by note, guaranty, endorsement, agreement to purchase or repurchase, agreement to lease, agreement to supply or advance funds or otherwise, except, (i) as permitted hereunder and (ii) for endorsements of instruments for collection in the ordinary course of business and except in favor of the Bank.

8.

The Borrower will, at any time and from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may reasonably be requested by the Bank, in order to cure any defects in the execution and delivery of, or to comply with or accomplish the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Note or any instrument(s) securing same.  
  
9.

In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in the Note, Security Agreement or any other instrument securing the Note (the "Security Instruments") or any other documents executed in connection therewith or herewith should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected thereby.  
  
10.

The Borrower will pay when due all its taxes, assessments and other liabilities, except those being contested in good faith and against which the Borrower has set up adequate reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
  
11.

The Borrower will pay its accounts payable and will maintain its accounts receivable in a manner consistent with normal business practices, including normal terms and conditions for payment, for entities engaged in similar operations in similar jurisdictions.
