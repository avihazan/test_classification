ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION  
  
OF

  
FUEL STOP 36, INC

STATE OF LOUISIANA

PARISH OF CALCASIEU

BE IT KNOWN, that on this 24 day of August 1989, personally came and appeared before me, the undersigned duly qualified Notary Public, the subscribers hereto, each of the full age of majority, who declared to me, in the presence of the undersigned competent witnesses, that, for purposes of forming a corporation for profit in accordance with the Louisiana Business Corporations Law, they do hereby adopt the following Articles of Incorporation:

ARTICLE I.

The name of this corporation is Fuel Stop 36, Inc.

ARTICLE II.

The objects and purposes for which this corporation is organized and the nature of the business to be carried on by it are stated and declared to be as follows:

To enter into any business or activity lawful under the laws of the State of Louisiana, either for its own account, or for the account of others as agent, and either as agent or principal to enter upon or engage in any kind of business or activity of any nature whatsoever in which corporations organized under the Louisiana Business Corporations Law may engage; and to the extent not prohibited thereby to enter upon and engage in any kind of business or activity of any nature whatsoever, in any state of the United States of America, any foreign nation, and any territory of any country to the extent permitted by the laws of such state, nation or territory; and to have and exercise all the express, implied and incidental powers conferred by the laws of the State of Louisiana or by any other applicable governmental body or agency.

ARTICLE III

The Corporation has authority to issue an aggregate of 100 shares of capital stock, all of which are designated common stock having no par value per share.

* * *

  


ARTICLE IV

Shareholders shall have preemptive rights.

ARTICLE V

Whenever the affirmative vote of shareholders is required to authorize or constitute corporate action, the consent in writing to such action signed only by shareholders holding that proportion of the total voting power or the question which is required by law or by these Articles of Incorporation shall be sufficient for the purpose, without necessity for a meeting of shareholders.

ARTICLE VI

The number of members of the Board of Directors shall be such number as may be designated from time to time in the by -laws, and if not so designated, as may from time to time be elected by the shareholders. Any director absent from a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may be represented by any other director as proxy, who may cast the vote of the absent director according to the written instructions, general or special, of the absent director.

ARTICLE VII

Cash, property or share dividends, shares issuable to shareholders in connection with a reclassification of stock, or the redemption price of redeemed shares, which are not claimed by the shareholders entitled thereto within one year after the dividend or redemption price became payable or the shares became issuable, despite reasonable efforts by the Corporation to pay the dividend or redemption price or deliver the certificates for the shares to such shareholders within such time, shall, at the expiration of such time, revert in full ownership to the Corporation, and the Corporation’s obligation to pay such dividend or redemption price or issue such shares, as the case may be, shall thereupon cease; provided that the Board of Directors may, at any time, for any reason satisfactory to it, but need not, authorize (1) payment of the amount of any cash or property dividend or redemption price or (2) issuance of any shares, ownership of which has reverted to the Corporation pursuant to this Article, to the entity who or which would be entitled thereto had such reversion not occurred.

ARTICLE VIII

A. Except as to transfer on death or gift of the stock of a stockholder to his spouse or linear descendents, no stock in this corporation shall be transferred unless the stock shall have been

* * *

  


first offered for sale to the corporation, and, if the corporation shall fail or refuse to accept the offer, to each of the other stockholders of this corporation. The offeree shall have an option to purchase the stock to be transferred at the following price: at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as the offeror shall have been offered by a third person at arm’s length, acting in good faith. The offer shall be in writing and shall set forth the price and terms on which the stock is offered. It shall be sent by certified mail to the President and Secretary of the corporation and to each stockholder at the address listed on the corporation books. The right to transfer stock shall not exist until the corporation and all existing stockholders either refuse in writing the offer so made, or waive the requirement of an offer in writing, or until they fail for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the written offer to accept it by compliance with the terms therein set forth. Regulations as to the formalities and procedures to be followed in effecting the transfer may be prescribed in the by-laws of the corporation.

B. Should the corporation be unable or unwilling for any reason to exercise its option as granted above, the option may be exercised by such stockholders as desire to exercise it, in the proportions in which these stockholders hold stock in the corporation.

C. After the expiration of the option period, no transfer at a price less than has been offered to the corporation and the other stockholders, or on terms or conditions varying from those stated in the letter notifying the corporation and the stockholders of a proposal to transfer, shall be valid, until the rights shall have been offered to the corporation and the stockholders to purchase the stock proposed to be transferred at the precise price and on the precise terms and conditions which were offered to or by the stockholder who proposes to transfer his stock.

D. The stockholders in this corporation may make arrangements, either in by-laws or by a shareholder agreement, between themselves relative to the purchase, among themselves, of the stock of this corporation in the event of the death, insanity, retirement or disability of any stockholder, and in the event of a transfer of his stock by donation to the stockholder’s spouse and linear descendants. A copy of any such agreement shall be filed with the Secretary of this corporation, and the provisions of any such agreement shall be binding upon the persons who are parties to it and their respective heirs, administrators, legatees, executors, successors, and assigns.

* * *

  


E. Except as to transfer on death or gift of the stock of a stockholder to his spouse or linear descendants (which shall be controlled if at all by the by-laws or by a shareholder agreement), no sale, mortgage, pledge, conveyance, transfer, seizure, donation sale under legal process of attachment or by virtue of any pledge or hypothecation, and no other disposal of stock of any nature whatsoever shall have any effects as related to the corporation or its stockholders, nor shall it be valid in any fashion until the option period provided above shall have expired.

F. The provisions of this Article or any part thereof may be altered and superseded by written shareholder agreements unanimously agreed upon and entered into by the corporation and all shareholders.

ARTICLE IX

Directors and officers of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer for any act or omission, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s or officer’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; (iii) for liability under Section 92(D) of the Louisiana Business Corporation Law; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or officer derives in improper personal benefit.

If the Louisiana Business Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors or officers, then the liability of a director or an officer of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Louisiana Business Corporation Law, as so amended, or by any other successor provision or provisions.

Any repeal or modification of this Article by the shareholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
