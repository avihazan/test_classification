In no event shall the Company have any liability or obligation with respect to taxes for which Executive may become liable as a result of the application of Code Section 409A. 

Article 4. Noncompetition, Confidentiality, Nonsolicitation, and Ownership

4.1. Noncompetition. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of his employment with the Company, he has or will have access to valuable proprietary information not known to the public that the Company possesses, including but not limited to, methods of operation, business strategies and plans, financial information, marketing materials, ideas, trade secrets, customer contacts and other customer information (“Proprietary Information”). The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Company has legitimate business interests in assuring that his unique knowledge of the Company, including but not limited to that knowledge regarding and relating to the foregoing information, is not disclosed or converted to the use of entities or individuals in competition with the Company. The Executive therefore agrees that during the Employment Period and for a period of one year after the date of termination or cessation of the Executive’s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, he will not, directly or indirectly, compete with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates by providing services or by being an officer, director, employee, consultant, agent, advisor, shareholder or owner to or of any other person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity that is a “Competing Business,” except that he may have an ownership interest of up to two percent (2%) of a Competing Business which is a public company. As used herein, a “Competing Business” is any business whose activities relate to the products or services of the same or similar type as the products or services which are sold (or, pursuant to an existing business plan, will be sold) to paying customers of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, and for which the Executive 

4

* * *

##### 

has the responsibility to plan, develop, manage, market, or oversee, or had any such responsibility within the Executive’s most recent twenty-four (24) months of employment with the Company. Following termination of employment, the Executive may request in writing an exception to the foregoing provision from the Company for prospective employment, which exception will be granted if the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that such prospective employment will not unduly or materially compete with or otherwise interfere with the business of the Company. 

In addition to the foregoing, the Executive agrees that, for a period of one year after the date of termination or cessation of the Executive’s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, he will not, directly or indirectly, intentionally entice, induce or solicit, or attempt to entice, induce or solicit, any individual or entity having a current or prospective business relationship with the Company, whether as a consultant, client, customer or otherwise, to terminate or cease such relationship with the Company, or to fail to enter into or renew such relationship with the Company. 

The parties agree that the above restrictions on competition are completely severable and independent agreements supported by good and valuable consideration and, as such, shall survive the termination of this Agreement for whatever reason. The parties further agree that any invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of such restrictions on competition shall not render invalid or unenforceable any remaining restrictions on competition. Additionally, should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of any provision of this Article 4.1 is too broad to be enforced as written, the parties intend that the court reform the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions herein are expressly assignable to any successor of the Company as set forth in Article 6(b). 

4.2. Nonsolicitation. During the Employment Period and for a one year after the termination or cessation of his employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, the Executive shall not, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, corporation, or entity: (a) directly, indirectly, or through a third party hire or cause to be hired; (b) directly, indirectly, or through a third party solicit; or (c) in any manner attempt to influence or induce any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates to leave the employment of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, nor shall he use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity any information obtained concerning the names and addresses the Company’s employees. The Executive further agrees and acknowledges that the Company has confidentiality and non-competition agreements with certain of its employees, and he agrees that he will not interfere with any such agreements. The parties agree that the above restrictions on hiring and solicitation are completely severable and independent agreements supported by good and valuable consideration and, as such, shall survive the termination of this Agreement for whatever reason. The parties further agree that any invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of such restrictions on hiring and solicitation shall not render invalid or unenforceable any remaining restrictions on hiring and solicitation. Additionally, should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of any provision of this Article 4.2 is too broad to be enforced as written, the parties intend that the court reform the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable.

4.3. Nondisclosure of Trade Secrets. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, the Executive agrees: (a) to treat all Proprietary Information in a secret and confidential manner, take all reasonable steps to maintain such secrecy, and comply with all applicable procedures established by the Company with respect to maintaining the secrecy and confidentiality of Proprietary Information; (b) to use Proprietary Information only as necessary and proper in the performance of the Executive’s duties as an employee of the Company; and (c) except as required in this Article 4.3, to not directly or indirectly, without the written consent of the Company, reproduce, copy, disseminate, publish, disclose, provide or otherwise make available to any person, firm, corporation, agency or other entity, any Proprietary Information. Under no circumstances shall the Executive use, directly or indirectly, any such Proprietary Information for his personal gain or profit. 

4.4. Nondisparagement. During the Employment Period and at all times thereafter, the Executive agrees to not disparage the Company or otherwise make comments harmful to the Company’s reputation.
