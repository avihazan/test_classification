The Plan was amended as of September 8, 2012 to revise subsections 2.7 to clarify when a Change of Control occurs.

1.2 Purposes of the Plan. The purposes of the Plan are to promote the success of the Company’s business, advance the interests of the Company, attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility at the Company, and provide additional incentives to selected key employees of the Company for outstanding performance. The Plan permits the award of Restricted Stock Units to key employees as the Committee may determine. Upon attainment of Performance Goals for the Performance Period, Participants will receive vested Restricted Stock Units, paid in Common Stock, and dividend equivalent rights (if any) with respect to vested Restricted Stock Units will be paid in cash.

(d) The Company’s stockholders approve a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

In addition, if a Change in Control constitutes a payment event or a toggle event with respect to any Award which provides for the deferral of compensation and is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the transaction or event described in subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) with respect to such Award must also constitute a “change in control event,” as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5) to the extent required by Section 409A.

5

* * *

  


  


Restricted Stock Units may be determined, in the sole discretion of the Committee, based on (a) the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on December 31, 2010, reduced by the value of any cash dividends or cash distributions (regular or otherwise) that are paid with respect to the Company’s Common Stock from that date to the date of grant or (b) the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date on which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan. Restricted Stock Units shall be granted pursuant to the USA Mobility, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. Further, if at any time the Common Stock ceases to be registered as a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act, whether as a result of a Change of Control or otherwise, the Committee may in its sole discretion convert any Restricted Stock Units into a right to receive cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock based upon the fair market value of a share of Common Stock at the time of or immediately prior to the time the Common Stock was no longer registered under the Exchange Act.

3.3 Award Agreements. Target Awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by Award Agreements. Award Agreements may be amended by the Committee with the consent of the germane Participant from time to time and need not contain uniform provisions.

3.4 Dividend Equivalent Rights. A Participant shall be entitled to dividend equivalent rights with respect to Restricted Stock Units to the extent that any cash dividends or cash distributions (regular or otherwise) are paid with respect to the Company’s Common Stock during the Performance Period. The dividend equivalent rights will be subject to the vesting restrictions and the other terms and conditions under this Plan that are applicable to the Restricted Stock Units until such time, if ever, as the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which the dividend equivalent rights are paid vest. 

SECTION 4.   
VESTING AND PAYMENT OF AWARDS

4.1 Attainment of Performance Goals. In order for Actual Awards to be earned and paid, the Company must attain the Performance Goals. If the Performance Goals are not met on or before the last day of the Performance Period, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may direct the Company to pay less than the Target Award to reflect actual performance. 

4.2 Vesting. 

(a) Target Awards shall vest upon the Committee’s reasonable determination that the Performance Goals have been achieved. If the Performance Goals are met, Participants will be entitled to the vested portion of a Target Award.

(b) In the event of a Change of Control, vesting shall be accelerated as follows provided that the Company is on track to meet the Performance Goals as reasonably determined by the Committee (as comprised immediately prior to the Change of Control). 

  


6

* * *

  


  


(i) If a Change of Control occurs during either of the first two years of the Performance Period, fifty percent (50%) of the Participant’s Target Award shall vest. 

(ii) If a Change of Control occurs during the third year of the Performance Period, seventy-five percent (75%) of the Participant’s Target Award shall vest. 

(iii) If a Change of Control occurs during the final year of the Performance Period, the Participant’s Target Award shall vest in full. 

With respect to an employee who becomes a Participant after the Effective Date of the Plan, the accelerated vesting described above will apply on a prorated basis based on the number of days worked during the Performance Period, unless otherwise determined by the Committee of the Board. For clarity, if an employee becomes a Participant in the second year of the Performance Period, accelerated vesting of his Target Award (prorated as described in section 4.4, below) will be calculated as follows: fifty percent (50%) of a Participant’s unvested Target Award will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Employee was a Participant in the Plan during the Performance Period, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. 

(c) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which Target Awards will vest provided that the Company is on target to meet the Performance Goals.

(d) All Actual Awards including pro-rated awards will be paid at the time provided in Section 4.3.

4.3 Time and Form of Payment. 

(a) Each Actual Award shall be paid in Common Stock pursuant to the Award Agreements, subject to any required withholding for income and employment taxes. Dividend equivalent rights shall be paid in cash in a single lump sum. 

(b) Actual Awards will be paid on or after the third business day after the Company’s annual audit for fiscal year 2014 has been completed and the Company’s fiscal year 2014 annual report on Form 10-K has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but in no event later than December 31, 2015. 

(c) Notwithstanding 4.3(b), in the event of a Participant’s death, the Participant’s estate will be eligible to receive an amount not greater than one-hundred percent (100%) of the Participant’s Target Award, prorated to reflect the number of days he or she worked during the Performance Period, and such amount, which will be determined in the Committee’s sole discretion, will be paid in the year following Participant’s death. For clarity, prorated awards will be calculated as follows: one-hundred percent (100%) of a Participant’s Target Award will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Participant was continuously providing services to the Company during the Performance Period through the date immediately prior to the Participant’s 

  


7

* * *

  


  


death, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, no payments contemplated by this Plan will be paid during the six-month period following a Participant’s Separation from Service unless the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, that paying such amounts at the times indicated in paragraphs 4.3(b) and (c) would not cause the Participant to incur an additional tax under Code section 409A, in which case the Actual Award shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant’s Separation from Service. 

4.4 Proration or Forfeiture of Target Award.

(a) Newly hired or promoted employees who are selected to participate in the Plan after March 1, 2011 will participate in the Plan on a prorated basis based on the number of days worked during the Performance Period after being selected to participate in the Plan. The prorated award will be calculated as follows: one-hundred percent (100%) of a Participant’s unvested Target Award will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Employee was a Participant in the Plan during the Performance Period, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. 

(b) If the Participant involuntarily Separates from Service without Cause or due to disability, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated Target Award if the Performance Goals are met provided that, in the event Participant involuntarily Separates from Service without Cause, he or she has executed a release, any waiting period in connection with such release has expired, he or she has not exercised any rights to revoke the release and he or she has followed any other applicable and customary termination procedures, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The unvested Target Award will be prorated to the date of Separation from Service, and the prorated award will be calculated as follows: one-hundred percent (100%) of a Participant’s unvested Target Award will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Participant was continuously providing services to the Company during the Performance Period through the date immediately prior to the Participant’s Separation from Service, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. Prorated awards will be paid to the Participant at the time provided in Sections 4.3. 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 4.4(b), any Participant employed by Amcom Software Inc. who involuntarily Separates from Service without Cause during the first year of the Plan shall forfeit any right to receive an Actual Award and any Participant employed by USA Mobility Wireless Inc. who involuntarily Separates from Service without Cause during the first or second year of the Plan shall forfeit any right to receive an Actual Award. Any Participant whose employment is terminated for Cause or voluntarily Separates from Service prior to the date Actual Awards are paid shall forfeit any right to receive an Actual Award.

SECTION 5.   
ADMINISTRATION

5.1 Committee is the Administrator. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall consist of not less than two (2) members of the Board, and no member of the Committee shall be a Participant. The members of the Committee shall be appointed from time to time by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Board.

5.2 Committee Authority. It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer the Plan in accordance with the Plan’s provisions. The Committee shall have all powers and discretion necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan and to control its operation, including, but not limited to, the power to (a) determine which Employees shall be granted awards, (b) prescribe the terms and conditions of awards, (c) interpret the Plan and the awards, (d) adopt such procedures and subplans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside of the United States, (e) adopt rules or principles for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith, and (f) interpret, amend or revoke any such rules or principles. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to an award granted pursuant to this Plan.

5.3 Decisions Binding. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee, the Board, and any delegate of the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law.

5.4 Delegation by the Committee. The Committee, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, may delegate all or part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more directors and/or officers of the Company.

SECTION 6.   
GENERAL PROVISIONS

6.1 Unsecured General Creditor. Actual Awards shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to establish or evidence any Participant’s claim of any right other than as an unsecured general creditor having the status of an employee of the Company or an Affiliate thereof with respect to any payment to which he or she may be entitled.

6.2 Tax Withholding. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from, or in respect of, any payment to be made an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, local or foreign tax withholding requirements (including, but not limited to, the Participant’s FICA and Social Security obligations). The Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her tax withholding obligations by having the Company withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to the Participant or, with respect to Restricted Stock Units, having the Company withhold a number of shares of Common Stock that become vested having a fair market value equal to 

  


9

* * *

  


  


the tax withholding obligations. The fair market value of the shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.

6.3 No Rights as Employee. Nothing in the Plan or any documents relating to the Plan shall (a) confer on a Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company; (b) constitute any contract or agreement of employment; or (c) interfere in any way with the Company’s right to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time, with or without cause. For purposes of the Plan, transfer of employment of a Participant between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Separation from Service.

6.4 Participation. No Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an award under this Plan.

6.5 Successors. This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company and the Participant’s heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

6.6 Payment in the Event of Death. In the event of a Participant’s death, any vested benefits remaining unpaid shall be paid to the Participant’s estate.

6.7 Nontransferability of Awards. No award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to an award granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant.

SECTION 7.   
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND DURATION

7.1 Amendment, Suspension or Termination. The Board, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Participants, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason, to the extent such action will not cause adverse tax consequences to a Participant under Code section 409A. Except as provided in Section 2.18, the amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or materially impair any rights or obligations under any Award Agreement. No award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan.

7.2 Duration of the Plan. The Plan shall commence on January 1, 2011 and, subject to Section 7.1 (regarding the Board’s right to amend or terminate the Plan), shall remain in effect thereafter.

SECTION 8.   
LEGAL CONSTRUCTION

8.1 Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Code section 409A and shall be interpreted to meet the requirements of Code section 409A. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the requirements of Code section 409A, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy Code section 409A, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee of any particular tax treatment to a Participant.
