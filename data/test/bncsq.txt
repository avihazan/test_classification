Section 4. Notice of Meetings; Closing of Transfer Books; Record Date. Notice of each meeting of the Company shall be mailed to each shareholder of the Company not less than ten nor more than fifty days previous to such meeting, and every such notice shall state the day and hour and the place at which the meeting is to be held and, in the case of any special meeting, shall indicate briefly the purpose or purposes thereof. The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power to close the transfer books of the Company for a period not exceeding seventy days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders or the date of payment of any dividend or the date for the allotment of rights or the date when any change or conversion, or exchange of shares goes into effect. In lieu, however, of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in

* * *

advance a date, not exceeding seventy days preceding the dates of the aforenamed occurrences, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of shares. In such case, such shareholders, and only such shareholders as are shareholders of the Company of record on the date of closing the transfer books or on the record date so fixed, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Company after such date of closing of the transfer books or such record date so fixed. If the Board of Directors shall not close the transfer books or set a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of shareholders, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the close of business on the 20th day preceding the date of the meeting are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment of the meeting. In order for any nomination for Director to be entertained at any meeting of for any business to be transacted at any annual meeting of the shareholders, other than nominations or business made or proposed by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, notice thereof must be received from the nominating or proposing shareholder by the Secretary of the Company, accompanied or promptly followed by such supporting information as he shall reasonably request, not less than seventy-five days prior to the date of any annual meeting or more than seven days after the mailing of notice of any special meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

  


Section 5. List of Voters. A complete list of all shareholders entitled to vote at any annual and special meeting of the Company’s shareholders is to be compiled at least ten days before such meeting by the officer or agent having charge of the transfer books for shares of stock of the Company. Such list is to be compiled in alphabetical order with the address and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The list must be kept on file in the registered office of the Company for a period of at least ten days prior to such meeting and must be open to inspection by any shareholder for such period during usual business hours. Such list must also be present and kept open at the time and place of such meeting and is subject to the inspection of any shareholder during such meeting. The original share ledger or transfer book, or a duplicate thereof kept in Missouri, is prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders of the Company entitled to examine such list or share ledger or transfer book, or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section does not affect the validity of any action taken at such meeting.

  


Section 6. Quorum.

* * *

by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, or these Bylaws. If, however, such quorum of shareholders shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the Company, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until requisite number of shareholders shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting at which the requisite number of shareholders shall be represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

  


Section 7. Voting Rights. Each outstanding share of stock having voting rights shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at any annual or special meeting of the Company.

  


Section 8. Voting by Proxy. Every person legally entitled to vote as a shareholder at any election, or on any question relating to the management or business of the Company may cast such vote by proxy; but said proxy shall be a shareholder of the Company otherwise entitled to vote, and the authority to cast such vote shall be in writing and shall state the name of the person authorized to cast such vote and the date of the meeting at which such vote shall be cast. In no event shall a proxy be valid for more than one annual or special meeting, as the case may be.

  


Section 9. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.
