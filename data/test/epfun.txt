SECTION 2. Annual Meeting. A meeting of the shareholders of the corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the corporation shall be held annually on the third Wednesday of October, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next day following which is not a legal holiday, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, or at such other date and time as the Board of Directors may determine.

The Board of Directors shall designate, when present, either the chairman of the board or the president to preside at such meetings.

  


SECTION 5. Notice of Meeting. Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that notice of a shareholders meeting to act on an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, a plan of merger or share exchange, a proposed sale of assets pursuant to Chapter 23B.12.020 of the Revised Code of Washington or its successor, or the dissolution of the corporation shall be given no fewer than 20 nor more than 60 days before the meeting date. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address as it appears on the stock transfer books or records of the corporation as of the record date prescribed in Section 6 of this Article II, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 120 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for less than 120 days or of the business to be transacted at the meeting, other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken.

  


SECTION 6. Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors shall fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the 

* * *

date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the day before the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment. 

  


SECTION 7. Voting Lists. At least 10 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to such meeting. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book shall be prima facie evidence of the shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Failure to comply with the requirements of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.

  


SECTION 8. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present or represented at a meeting, a majority of those present or represented may transact any business which comes before the meeting, unless a greater percentage is required by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws. If less than a quorum of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified, and in the case of any adjourned meeting called for the election of directors, those who attend the second of the adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.

SECTION 9. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the Board of Directors. All proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the commencement of meetings. No proxy may be effectively revoked until notice in writing of such revocation has been given to the secretary of the corporation by the shareholder (or his duly authorized attorney in fact, as the case may be) granting the proxy. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution unless it is coupled with an interest.

  


SECTION 10. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. A certified copy of a resolution adopted by such directors shall be conclusive as to their action.

  


Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name.

  


Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed.

  


2

* * *

If shares are held jointly by three or more fiduciaries, the will of the majority of the fiduciaries shall control the manner of voting or giving of a proxy, unless the instrument or order appointing such fiduciaries otherwise directs.

  


A shareholder, whose shares are pledged, shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter, the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

  


Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the corporation, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.

  


SECTION 11. Voting. Every holder of outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at any meeting shall be entitled to the number of votes (if any) as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation. Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, by statute, or by these Bylaws, a majority of those votes cast by shareholders at a lawful meeting shall be sufficient to pass on a transaction or matter.

  


SECTION 12. Informal Action by Shareholders. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be given by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.

The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

  


SECTION 7. Quorum. A majority of the number of directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time. Notice of any adjourned meeting shall be given in the same manner as prescribed by Section 6 of this Article III.

SECTION 13. Presumption of Assent. A director of the corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on a corporation matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent or abstention shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he or she shall file a written dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the secretary of the corporation within five (5) days after the date a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

  


SECTION 14. Performance of Duties.  A director shall perform his or her duties as a director, including the duties as a member or any committee of the board upon which he or she may serve, in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the corporation, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In performing such duties, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinion, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by: (i) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (ii) counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or expert competence; or (iii) a committee of the board upon which he or she does not serve, duly designated in accordance with a provision of these Bylaws, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director reasonably believes to merit confidence. However, a director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.

Any member of the executive committee may waive notice of any meeting and no notice of any meeting need be given to any member thereof who attends in person. The notice of a meeting of the executive committee need not state the business proposed to be transacted at the meeting.

Each officer shall hold office until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his death or until he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided. Election or appointment of an officer, employee or agent shall not of itself create contract rights. The Board of Directors may authorize the corporation to enter into an employment contract with any officer in accordance with applicable law.

  


SECTION 3. Removal. Any officer may be removed by vote of two-thirds of the Board of Directors whenever, in its judgment, the best interests of the corporation will be served thereby, but such removal, other than for cause, shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.

SECTION 1. Contracts. Except as otherwise prescribed by these Bylaws with respect to certificates for shares, the Board of Directors may authorize any officer, employee, or agent of the corporation to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation.

In the absence of fraud, the fact that any director, officer, employee, shareholder, or any corporation, association, firm or other entity of which any director, officer, employee or shareholder is interested, is in any way interested in any transaction or contract shall not make the transaction or contract void or voidable, or require the director, officer, employee or shareholder to account to this corporation for any profits therefrom if the transaction or contract is or shall be authorized, ratified, or approved by (i) the vote of a majority of the Board of Directors excluding any interested director or directors, (ii) the written consent of the

Nothing herein contained shall create or imply any liability in the circumstances above described or prevent the authorization, ratification or approval of such transactions or contracts in any other manner.

SECTION 6. Shares of Another Corporation. Shares of another corporation held by this corporation may be voted by the president or any vice president, or by proxy appointment form by either of them, unless the directors by resolution shall designate some other person to vote the shares.

Certificates for Shares and Their Transfer

  


SECTION 1. Certificates for Shares and Uncertificated Shares. Certificates representing shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be in such form as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Such certificates shall be signed by the chief executive officer or by any other officer of the corporation authorized by the Board of Directors, attested by the secretary or an assistant secretary, and may be sealed with the corporate seal or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of such officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent or a registrar, other than the corporation itself or one of its employees. Each certificate for shares of capital stock shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for the like number of shares has been surrendered and canceled, except that in case of a lost or destroyed certificate, a new certificate may be issued therefor upon such terms and indemnity to the corporation as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation’s stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by certificates until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. In addition, notwithstanding the adoption of any such resolution providing for uncertificated shares, every holder of capital stock of the corporation theretofore represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate for shares of capital stock of the corporation signed by, or in the name of the corporation as set forth above, certifying the number of shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.

  


SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares. Stock of the corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the corporation, and in the case of certificated shares of stock, only by the person named in the certificate or by such person’s attorney lawfully constituted in writing and upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; or, in the case of uncertificated shares of stock, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such person’s attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and endorsement, compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the corporation shall determine to waive such requirement. With respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the corporation shall be marked “Cancelled,” with the date of cancellation, by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the corporation or the transfer agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

  


SECTION 3. Certification of Beneficial Ownership. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure whereby a shareholder of the corporation may certify in writing to the corporation that all or a portion of the shares registered in the name of such shareholder are held for the account of a specified person or persons. Upon receipt by the corporation of a certification complying with such procedure, the persons specified in the certification shall be deemed, for the purpose or purposes set forth in the certification, to be the holders of record of the number of shares specified in place of the shareholder making the certification.

SECTION 4. Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.
