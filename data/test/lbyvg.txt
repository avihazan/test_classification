TERMS OF AGREEMENT

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

1\. Definitions. Schedule 1 sets forth a Glossary of terms that are used herein. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the Glossary or the Plan. 

2\. Award of Restricted Stock Pursuant to Plan. Subject to the terms and conditions, including the restrictions and risk of forfeiture, set forth herein and in the Plan, Grantee is hereby granted under the Plan an award (“Award”) of the number of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the “Shares” or “Restricted Stock”) set forth for Grantee on the BOL System under the Grant Information tab (for the Date of Grant). 

3\. Certificate. Reasonably promptly after Grantee accepts the Award, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall either (i) issue a stock certificate, registered in the name of the Grantee evidencing the Shares and bearing an appropriate legend specifying that such Shares are not transferable and are subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, or (ii) establish and maintain, or cause a representative to establish and maintain, an account to record the Shares until such Shares become vested or are forfeited.

4\. Withholding of Shares for Taxes. The Company shall withhold an amount equal to the federal, state and/or local taxes due at the time the Grantee has taxable income in respect of the Shares (or, if the Grantee makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) in connection with the Award, on or about the Date of Grant). Unless otherwise determined by the Company, such withholding shall be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares having a fair market value (as determined by the Company) equal to the amount of tax required to be withheld. The Grantee understands that the Grantee (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax liability of the Grantee that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

5\. Rights of Ownership and Restrictions on Transfer. Unless and until the Shares are forfeited, notwithstanding the restrictions and risk of forfeiture set forth herein and in the Plan, the Grantee shall have the right to vote the Shares and, provided Grantee has accepted the Award by the Acceptance Deadline, to receive dividends on the Shares. The Shares granted hereby shall not be transferable until vesting as set forth in Paragraph 6 below, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

6\. Vesting. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Plan, the Shares shall become nonforfeitable and fully transferable (shall “vest”) in four equal annual installments, 25% on June 1,  , 25% on June 1,  , 25% on June 1,  , and 25% on June 1,  (the “Vesting Dates”), subject to the Grantee remaining continuously employed with the Company on such dates. 

7\. Forfeiture of Unvested Stock on Termination of Employment. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Plan, upon the termination of employment of the Grantee with the Company for any reason, all outstanding unvested Shares held by the Grantee at the time of such termination shall be immediately forfeited and surrendered to the Company, and any stock certificates issued with respect to such unvested Shares shall be cancelled and such unvested Shares shall cease to remain outstanding. 

8\. Vesting on Death or Disability. Notwithstanding anything in Paragraph 7 to the contrary, if a Grantee’s termination of employment is by reason of the death or “permanent and total disability” (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) of the Grantee, all Shares held by the Grantee at the time of such termination shall become immediately vested as provided in Section 13 of the Plan. 

9\. Vesting on Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 10(e) of the Plan), all Shares held by the Grantee at the time of such Change in Control shall become immediately vested as provided in Section 10(e) of the Plan, except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 9. The Grantee agrees that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or the terms of the Plan or any other Company plan and so long as the terms and conditions set forth in the Consents are applicable (or such terms and conditions have been waived, modified or eliminated with the approval of the Board), neither (A) the acquisition by ESL of either (x) direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the Common Stock or (y) direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total combined voting power with respect to the election of directors of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company nor (B) ESL having the power (whether as a result of stock ownership, revocable or irrevocable proxies, contract or otherwise) or ability to elect or cause the election of directors

consisting at the time of such election of a majority of the Board, shall constitute a Change in Control with respect to the Shares granted pursuant to this Agreement or constitute a “change in control” with respect to any other restricted shares of common stock or stock options of the Company held by Grantee as of the date hereof or granted to Grantee in the future under the Plan or any other Company plan; provided, however, that the following events shall constitute a Change in Control for purposes of this Agreement and constitute a “change in control” with respect to any other restricted shares of common stock or stock options of the Company held by Grantee as of the date hereof or granted to Grantee in the future under the Plan or any other Company plan: (i) a transaction in which the Company is acquired by or merges, consolidates or combines with, or is merged, consolidated or combined with, ESL or any entity controlled by ESL; or (ii) a “Rule 13e-3 transaction” with ESL, as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

10\. Termination of Restricted Stock if Employment is Terminated Due to a Change in Ownership of Subsidiary or Affiliate or Spin-Off. For the purpose of clarification, if Grantee ceases to be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company following a Change in Ownership or Spin-Off of the Subsidiary, Affiliate or business unit by which Grantee is employed (whether because of the termination of employment of Grantee or because the corporation or other entity by which Grantee was employed ceases to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company or otherwise), then all outstanding unvested Shares held by the Grantee at the time of such termination shall be immediately forfeited and surrendered to the Company, and any stock certificates issued with respect to such unvested Shares shall be cancelled and such unvested Shares shall cease to remain outstanding. 

11\. Retirement. Upon the Grantee attaining age 55 and completion of 6 years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate as set forth in Section 13 of the Plan (“Retirement Eligibility”) or if the Grantee has attained Retirement Eligibility as of the Date of Grant, all Shares granted hereunder to the Grantee shall become immediately vested (and, accordingly, shall become subject to share withholding under Paragraph 4 of this Agreement), although such Shares (except for Shares to be withheld in accordance with Paragraph 4) shall remain nontransferable until the earliest of (a) the Grantee’s termination of employment, (b) the Vesting Date on which such Shares would otherwise have become vested, or (c) the occurrence of any event that would have caused acceleration of vesting under the terms of the Plan or this Agreement. For the purpose of clarification, in the event the Grantee has attained Retirement Eligibility, the vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 6 shall apply to the number of Shares remaining after Company withholding in accordance with Paragraph 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of clarification, upon a termination of the Grantee’s employment by the Company for Cause after Retirement Eligibility and prior to the earlier of the Vesting Date on which such Shares would otherwise have become vested or the occurrence of any event that would have caused acceleration of vesting under the terms of the Plan or this Agreement, the Shares that have not yet become transferable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be forfeited and surrendered to the Company, and any stock certificates issued with respect to such Shares shall be cancelled and such Shares shall cease to remain outstanding. 

12\. Grantee Bound by Terms of Plan. Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and provisions thereof.
