(e) Termination by Vasomedical for Cause. In the event that Employee’s employment is terminated for Cause, he shall be entitled only to the compensation and benefits specified in Section 11(b).

  


(f) Termination by Vasomedical Without Cause or by Employee for Good Reason.

If, during the Employment Term, Vasomedical terminates Employee’s employment without Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason, in either such case, other than within two years after a Change in Control, he shall be entitled to receive, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release and to Employee’s continued compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in Sections 12 and 13, commencing no later than forty-five (45) days after such termination, in addition to the compensation and benefits specified in Section 11(b):

7

* * *

(i) continued Salary for twenty four (24) months payable in twenty four (24) equal monthly installments and commencing as soon as practicable following such termination; provided that in the event the remaining Employment Term is less than 24 months, the Employee shall receive monthly payments for the greater of (a) the remainder of the Employment Term, or (b) 12 months;

(h) Vesting of Equity Upon Certain Terminations. If, during the Employment Term, Vasomedical terminates Employee’s employment without Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason, in either such case, all unvested options and shares shall vest in full as of the date of termination.

(i) Specified Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (i) Employee is to receive payments or benefits under Section 11 by reason of his separation from service (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code) other than as a result of his death, (ii) Employee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code Section 409A for the period in which the payment or benefits would otherwise commence, and/or (iii) such payment or benefit would otherwise subject Employee to any tax, interest or penalty imposed under Section 409A of the Code (or any regulation promulgated thereunder) if the payment or benefit would commence within six months of a termination of Employee’s employment, then such payment or benefit required under Section 11 shall not commence until the first day which is at least six months and one day after the termination of Employee’s employment. Each severance installment contemplated under this Section 11 shall be treated as a separate payment in a series of separate payments under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). Such payments or benefits, together with simple interest calculated at LIBOR as of the date of such separation from service, which would otherwise have been required to be made over such six month period, shall be paid to Employee in one lump sum payment or otherwise provided to Employee as soon as administratively feasible after the first day which is at least six months after the termination of Employee’s employment. Thereafter, the payments and benefits shall continue, if applicable, for the relevant period set forth above. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to “termination of employment” and other similar language shall be deemed to refer to Employee’s “separation from service” as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), including, without limitation, the default presumptions thereof.

  


(j) Miscellaneous. For the avoidance of doubt, if applicable, Employee shall only be entitled to receive the payments and benefits provided under Section 11 (f) or 11 (g), which ever is applicable, but not under both such sections.

12.

NO DUTY TO MITIGATE.  
  
In the event of a termination of employment under Sections 11 (c), 11 (f) or 11 (g), Employee shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any payment hereunder be subject to offset in the event Employee does receive compensation for any reason from any other source.

13.

PARACHUTES.  
  
Upon a Change in Control during the Employment Term, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any payments or benefits received or to be received by Employee in connection with his employment with Vasomedical (or termination thereof) would subject Employee to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), and if the net-after tax amount (taking into account all applicable taxes payable by Employee, including any Excise Tax) that Employee would receive with respect to such payments or benefits does not exceed the net-after tax amount Employee would receive if the amount of such payment and benefits were reduced to the maximum amount which could otherwise be payable to Employee without the imposition of the Excise Tax, then, to the extent necessary to eliminate the imposition of the Excise Tax, (a) such cash payments and benefits shall first be reduced (if necessary, to zero) and (b) all other non-cash payments and benefits shall next be reduced.

14\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

  


(a) General.

  


(i) Employee understands and hereby acknowledges that as a result of his employment with Vasomedical he will necessarily become informed of and have access to certain valuable and confidential information of Vasomedical and any of its subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates, including, without limitation, inventions, trade secrets, technical information, computer software and programs, know-how and plans (“Confidential Information”), and that any such Confidential Information, even though it may be developed or otherwise acquired by Employee, is the exclusive property of Vasomedical to be held by him in trust solely for Vasomedical’s benefit.

  


(ii) Accordingly, Employee hereby agrees that, during the Employment Term and subsequent thereto, he shall not, and shall not cause others to, use, reveal, report, publish, transfer or otherwise disclose to any person, corporation or other entity any Confidential Information without prior written consent of the Board, except to (A) responsible officers and employees of Vasomedical or (B) responsible persons who are in a contractual or fiduciary relationship with Vasomedical or who need such information for purposes in the interest of Vasomedical. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the prohibitions of this clause (ii) shall not apply to any Confidential Information that becomes of general public knowledge other than from Employee or is required to be divulged by court order or administrative process.

  


(b) Return of Documents. Upon termination of his Employment Term with Vasomedical for any reason or, if applicable, upon expiration of the Consulting Period, Employee shall promptly deliver to Vasomedical all plans, drawings, manuals, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, computer programs and copies thereof and all other materials, including without limitation those of a secret or confidential nature, relating to Vasomedical’s business that are then in his possession or control.

  


10

* * *

(c) Remedies and Sanctions. In the event that Employee is found to be in violation of Section 14(a) or (b) above, Vasomedical shall be entitled to relief as provided in Section 16 below.

  


15\. NON-COMPETITION/NON-SOLICITATION.

  


(a) Prohibitions. During the Employment Term and for any additional period during which he continues to receive compensation from the Company, Employee shall not, without prior written authorization of the Board, directly or indirectly, through any other individual or entity:  


(i) become on officer or employee of, or render any service to, any direct competitor of Vasomedical;

  


(ii) solicit or induce any customer of Vasomedical to cease purchasing goods or services from Vasomedical or to become a customer of any competitor of Vasomedical; or

  


(iii) solicit or induce any employee of Vasomedical to become employed by any competitor of Vasomedical.

  


(b) Remedies and Sanctions. In the event that Employee is found to be in violation of Section 15(a) above, Vasomedical shall be entitled to relief as provided in Section 15 below.

  


(c) Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 15(a) above, its provisions shall not:

  


(i) apply if Vasomedical terminates Employee’s employment without Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason or his employment ends because of a Change in Control, each as provided in Section 11(f) or 11(g) above; or

  


(ii) be construed as preventing Employee from investing his assets in any business that is not a direct competitor of Vasomedical.

  


16\. REMEDIES/SANCTIONS.

  


Employee acknowledges that the services he is to render under this Agreement are of a unique and special nature, the loss of which cannot reasonably or adequately be compensated for in monetary damages, and that irreparable injury and damage may result to Vasomedical in the event of any breach of this Agreement or default by Employee. Because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information and the importance of the prohibitions against competition and solicitation, Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Vasomedical will suffer irreparable harm if he fails to comply with his obligations under Section 14(a) or (b) above or Section 15(a) above and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Vasomedical for any such breach. Accordingly, Employee agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available to either Party at law, in equity or otherwise, Vasomedical will be entitled to seek injunctive relief or specific performance to enforce the terms, or prevent or remedy the violation, of any provisions of this Agreement.

  


11

(a) All payments to Employee or his Beneficiary under this Agreement shall be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as required by law.

Vasomedical shall cause Employee to be covered at all times by directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. Vasomedical shall continue to indemnify Employee as provided above and maintain such liability insurance coverage for him for at least three (3) years after the Employment Term for any claims that may be made against him with respect to his service as an officer of Vasomedical.
