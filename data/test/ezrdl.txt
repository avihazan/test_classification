THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT entered into as of the 19th day of November, 2008, by and between HARTMARX CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and JAMES T. CONNERS ("Executive").

WITNESSETH THAT:

WHEREAS, the Executive is a party to a Severance Letter Agreement with the Company dated November 19, 2008 (the "Severance Letter");

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement pertaining to the terms of Executive's employment by the Company or by any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company; and

WHEREAS, upon the execution of this Agreement by the Company and Executive the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control and govern the employment relationship between the Company and Executive.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby covenanted and agreed by the parties hereto as follows:

1\. Agreement Period; At-Will Employment. The Company and Executive acknowledge and understand that Executive's employment with Company is on an "at-will" basis and nothing in this Agreement is intended to give Executive the right to be retained in the employ of Hartmarx or any of its subsidiaries or to interfere with the Company's right to discharge Executive at any time for any reason. This Agreement is not a guarantee of employment and is not an agreement by Company to employ Executive or to continue to employ Executive for any specific term or period. The Company and Executive acknowledge and agree that this Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Executive's employment and compensation to be paid to Executive commencing on the date hereof and continuing through November 30, 2010 (the "Agreement Period"), provided that Executive's employment is not otherwise terminated before the expiration of the Agreement Period; provided further, however, that if the Executive's employment is terminated for any reason following a Change in Control (as defined in the Severance Letter), the Agreement Period shall terminate upon such termination of employment and the Executive's rights with respect to such termination of employment (including the reasons therefor) shall be governed by the provisions of the Severance Letter.

2\. Performance of Duties. While employed by the Company, Executive shall devote substantially all his full working time, attention and energies during normal business hours to the performance of his duties for the Company and its subsidiaries and shall perform his duties faithfully and efficiently, subject to the direction of the Company Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.

3\. Compensation. As compensation for the performance by Executive of his obligations hereunder:

(a) Base Salary. During the Agreement Period the Company shall pay Executive an annual base salary of not less than $185,000 ("Base Salary"). Base Salary shall be paid in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices. Base Salary may be increased at the discretion of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the "Committee") and once so increased shall not thereafter be decreased, except for across-the-board reductions similarly affecting all executives of the Company.

(b) Management Incentive Plan. Executive shall participate in the Company Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP") and/or any successor plan.

(c) Participation in Benefit Plans. During the Agreement Period the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and welfare benefit plans and programs now or hereafter applicable to any other senior executives of the Company on a basis no less favorable than is made available to any other senior executive of the Company.

(e) At-Will Employment. The Company retains the right to discharge Executive at any time for any reason.

(a) Notice of Termination. Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Company or by the Executive (other than termination pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 12. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall identify in reasonable detail the reason for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and the reasons set forth in such Notice of Termination shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

(b) Termination By Company. Upon termination of Executive's employment hereunder during the Agreement Period by the Company for any reason other than any of the reasons set forth in Section 4(d), then, in lieu of any further salary or bonus for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Executive, and expressly subject to Executive's compliance with the provisions of Sections 8 and 9, below:

(i) The Company shall continue to pay to Executive Base Salary as of the Date of Termination (without giving effect to any decrease therein which constitutes the basis, or one of the bases, upon which the Notice of Termination is based), for a period which is the longer of (A) the period commencing on the Date of Termination and continuing through November 30, 2010 (the "Severance Period") or (B) the severance period provided under the Company's severance pay policy then in effect, payable semi-monthly or more frequently, in arrears, commencing on the Date of Termination; provided, however, that if a Change in Control occurs during the Severance Period, the Company shall pay the Executive by no later than five (5) days following the Change in Control a lump sum in cash equal to the sum of the remaining payments that would have been payable to the Executive hereunder had no Change in Control occurred, and payments hereunder shall terminate.

(ii) The Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum in cash, within ten (10) days of the Date of Termination, equal to the sum of any unpaid incentive compensation allocated or awarded to Executive under the MIP with respect to any fiscal year ending prior to the year in which the Date of Termination occurs.

(iii) During the Severance Period the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive with life, disability, accident and health insurance benefits ("Welfare Benefits") substantially similar in all material respects to those which the Executive is receiving immediately prior to the Date of Termination (without giving effect to any decrease therein which constitutes the basis, or one of the bases, upon which the Notice of Termination is based), of if such benefits are not available or the provision of such benefits would not be allowed under the terms of such plans, the Company shall pay Executive the after-tax economic equivalent thereof. If the Executive receives, or becomes eligible to receive, Welfare Benefits from another source, then the Welfare Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6(b)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent of such other Welfare Benefits received by, or made available to, the Executive during the Severance Period (and any such Welfare Benefits received by or made available to the Executive shall be reported to the Company by the Executive).

(iv) Effective as of the Date of Termination, all stock options granted to Executive under any of the Company's stock option plans prior to the Date of Termination which are exercisable as of the Date of Termination shall continue to be exercisable and Executive shall be entitled to exercise any or all of such options within the times and in accordance with the terms of such options as set forth in the grant document evidencing same, but not beyond the expiration date of such option. Any stock options granted to Executive which are not exercisable as of the Date of Termination but which become exercisable during the Severance Period shall thereafter be exercisable by Executive and Executive shall be entitled to exercise any or all of such options within the times and in accordance with the terms of such options as set forth in the grant document evidencing same, but not beyond the expiration date of such option.

(v) Effective as of the Date of Termination, Executive shall continue to hold all restricted stock granted to Executive prior to the Date of Termination and if any of such restricted stock vests during the Severance Period, Executive shall be entitled to such shares and all restrictions thereon shall lapse.

In addition, within ten (10) days of the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay the Executive, or his legal representative or estate, as applicable, any amounts accrued but not paid pursuant to Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d) and 3(e) in respect of periods ending prior to the Date of Termination.

7\. Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 6(b)(i) through (v) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive's entitlement to a series of installments payments shall be treated and shall be deemed to be an entitlement to a series of separate payments within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder.

(b) Any severance benefits paid within the later of (i) 2-1/2 months of the end of the Company's taxable year containing the Executive's severance from employment, or (ii) 2-1/2 months of the end of the Executive's taxable year containing the severance from employment shall be exempt from Section 409A and shall be paid in accordance with Section 6(b). Severance benefits subject to this Section 7(b) shall be treated and shall be deemed to be an entitlement to a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

(c) To the extent severance benefits are not exempt from Section 409A under Section 7(b) above, any benefits paid in the first 6 months following the Executive's severance from employment that are equal to or less than the lesser of the amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)(1) and (2) shall be exempt from Section 409A and shall be paid in accordance with Section 6(b). Severance benefits subject to this Section 7(c) shall be treated and shall be deemed to be an entitlement to a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

(f) For purposes of this Section 7, any reference to severance of employment or termination of employment shall mean a "separation from service" as defined in Treasury Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "specified employee" shall have the meaning set forth in Treasury Reg. Section 1.409A-1(i). The determination of whether the Executive is a "specified employee" shall be made by the Employer in good faith applying the applicable Treasury regulations.

In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 8, each party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to remedy any such breach or threatened breach, the parties acknowledging that damages would be inadequate and insufficient.
