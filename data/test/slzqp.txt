(c) Cashless Exercise; or

(d) by a combination of any of the permitted methods of payment in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) above.

8. Non-Assignability. Except as provided in the Plan or this Agreement, the Option is not assignable or transferable by the Grantee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and is exercisable, during the Grantee's lifetime, only by the Grantee.
