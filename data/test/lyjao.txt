2006 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

February 18, 2009

To: «First_Name» «Middle» «Last_Name»«Suffix»

Pioneer Natural Resources Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is pleased to grant you an award (the “Award”) to receive «Total_Shares» Restricted Stock Units (the “Restricted Stock Units”) whereby each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company (the “Stock”), plus an additional amount pursuant to Section 2, subject to certain restrictions and on the terms and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the “Agreement”) and the Pioneer Natural Resources Company 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). A copy of the Plan is available upon request. Except as provided below, to the extent that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the expressly applicable terms of the Plan, you acknowledge and agree that those terms of the Plan shall control and, if necessary, the applicable provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed amended so as to carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan. Terms that have their initial letters capitalized, but that are not otherwise defined in this Agreement, shall have the meanings given to them in the Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

This Agreement sets forth the terms of the agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to be bound by all of the terms hereof.

1. No Shareholder Rights. The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement do not and shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of the Company prior to the date shares of Stock are issued to you in settlement of the Award. Your rights with respect to Restricted Stock Units shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date on which rights become vested and the restrictions with respect to the Restricted Stock Units lapse in accordance with Section 4, 6 or 7.

2. Dividend Equivalents. In the event that the Company declares and pays a dividend in respect of its outstanding shares of Stock and, on the record date for such dividend, you hold Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement that have not been settled, the Company shall pay to you an amount in cash equal to the cash dividends you would have received if you were the Beneficial Owner, as of such record date, of the number of shares of Stock related to the portion of your Restricted Stock Units that have not been settled as of such record date, such payment to be made on or promptly following the date that the Company pays such dividend (however, in no event shall the dividend equivalent payment be made later than 30 days following the date on which the Company pays such dividend).

* * *

3. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units; Issuance of Stock; Payment of Stock. No shares of Stock shall be issued to you prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest and the restrictions with respect to the Restricted Stock Units lapse, in accordance with Section 4, 6 or 7. Neither this Section 3 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Section 3 shall be construed to create a trust of any kind. After any Restricted Stock Units vest pursuant to Section 4, 6 or 7 the Company shall, on or promptly following the applicable dates set forth in Section 5, cause to be issued Stock in book entry form registered in your name in payment of such vested Restricted Stock Units upon receipt by the Company of any required tax withholding with respect to such shares. The value of any fractional Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in cash at the time Stock is issued to you in connection with the Restricted Stock Units. The value of the fractional Restricted Stock Units shall equal the percentage of a Restricted Stock Unit represented by a fractional Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Stock. The value of such shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time.

4. Expiration of Restrictions and Risk of Forfeiture. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the forfeiture restrictions on the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement will expire in full on the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the “Vesting Date”); provided, however, that such restrictions will expire on the Vesting Date only if you have been an employee of the Company or of a Subsidiary continuously from the date of this Agreement through the Vesting Date; provided, further, however, that if you cease to be an employee of the Company or of a Subsidiary for any reason after the Vesting Date, all Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement will survive the termination of employment.

5. Payment Date. The payment date of the Stock related to your Restricted Stock Units will be the date on which the restrictions on such Restricted Stock Units expire as provided in Section 4, 6 or 7 of this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7(c), in the event that restrictions on your Restricted Stock Units expire due to the termination of your employment relationship with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries by which you are employed as a result of your Normal Retirement, then the payment date of the Stock related to such Restricted Stock Units will be the date on which the restrictions on such Restricted Stock Units would have expired as provided in Section 4 had you remained an employee of the Company or of a Subsidiary continuously from the date of this Agreement through the Vesting Date.

6. Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding Section 4 of this Agreement, but subject to Section 27 of this Agreement, uponthe occurrence of a Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award shall become immediately and unconditionally vested and the shares of Stock related to such Restricted Stock Units shall be paid to you immediately.

7.

Termination of Employment.  
  
(a) Termination By Employee Without Good Reason. If your employment relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated voluntarily by you prior to the Vesting Date and such termination is not a Termination for Good Reason (as such term is

2  
  
* * *

defined in the Severance Agreement between you and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries), then all Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall become null and void as of the date of such termination.

(b) Termination By The Company for Cause. If your employment relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Company prior to the Vesting Date and such termination is a Termination for Cause (as such term is defined in the Severance Agreement between you and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries), then all Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall become null and void as of the date of termination.

(c) Other Termination Events. Subject to Section 27 of this Agreement, if your employment relationship with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries by which you are employed is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any of the following events:

(i)

your death;  
  
(ii)

your Disability;  
  
(iii)

your Normal Retirement;  
  
(iv) a termination by you that is a Termination for Good Reason; or  
  
(v)

a termination by the Company that is not a Termination for Cause,  
  
then the restrictions on a number of the Restricted Stock Units shall automatically lapse such that the number of Restricted Stock Units for which the restrictions have lapsed as of the termination date will be equal to the product of (i) the total number of Restricted Stock Units granted to you pursuant to this Agreement, times (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months (counting the month in which your termination of employment occurs as a full month), beginning with the first full month following the date of this Agreement, during which you were employed by the Company and/or any Subsidiary and the denominator of which is 36.

The portion, if any, of your Restricted Stock Units for which the restrictions have not lapsed as of the termination date of your employment relationship shall become null and void as of the termination date; provided, however, that the portion, if any, of this Award for which forfeiture restrictions have lapsed as of the date of termination shall survive.

For purposes of this Section 7(c), “Disability” shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Severance Agreement between you and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; and the term “Normal Retirement” shall mean the termination of your employment relationship with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries by which you are employed due to your retirement on or after the date that you attain age 60.

8. Adjustment Provisions. In the event there is any change in the Stock by reason of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares or otherwise, the number of shares associated with the Award of Restricted Stock Units subject to

3  
  
* * *

this Agreement shall be adjusted in the manner consistent with the adjustment provisions provided in Section 9(b) and 9(c)(ii) of the Plan.

9. Furnish Information. You agree to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirements imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.

10. Remedies. The parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from each other reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement whether by an action to enforce specific performance or for damages for its breach or otherwise.

11. Information Confidential. As partial consideration for the granting of the Award hereunder, you hereby agree with the Company that you will keep confidential all information and knowledge, except that which has been disclosed in any public filings required by law, that you have relating to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that such information may be disclosed as required by law and may be given in confidence to your spouse, tax and financial advisors, or to a financial institution to the extent that such information is necessary to secure a loan. In the event any breach of this promise comes to the attention of the Company, it shall take into consideration that breach in determining whether to recommend the grant of any future similar award to you, as a factor militating against the advisability of granting any such future award to you.

12. Payment of Taxes. The Company may from time to time require you to pay to the Company (or the Company’s Subsidiary if you are an employee of a Subsidiary of the Company) the amount that the Company deems necessary to satisfy the Company’s or its Subsidiary’s current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes or social security or other obligations that you incur as a result of the Award, including without limitation with respect to any payment pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement. With respect to any required tax withholding, unless another arrangement is permitted by the Company in its discretion, the Company shall withhold from the shares of Stock to be issued to you the number of shares necessary to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold taxes, that determination to be based on the shares’ Fair Market Value at the time as of which such determination is made. In the event the Company subsequently determines that the aggregate Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld as payment of any tax withholding obligation is insufficient to discharge that tax withholding obligation, then you shall pay to the Company, immediately upon the Company’s request, the amount of that deficiency.

13. Right of the Company and Subsidiaries to Terminate Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or interfere in any way with the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to terminate your employment at any time.

14. No Liability for Good Faith Determinations. Neither the Company nor the members of the Board and the Committee shall be liable for any act, omission or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to this Agreement or the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder.

Records of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding your period of employment, termination of employment and the reason therefor, leaves of absence, re-employment, and other matters shall be conclusive for all purposes hereunder, unless determined by the Company to be incorrect.

17. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.

18. Notices. Whenever any notice is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be in writing and personally delivered or sent by mail. Any such notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder shall be deemed to be delivered on the date on which it is personally delivered, or, whether actually received or not, on the third Business Day after it is deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, addressed to the person who is to receive it at the address which such person has theretofore specified by written notice delivered in accordance herewith.
