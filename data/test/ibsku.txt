IX. CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION

  


A.

The Executive acknowledges that:  
  
  


1.

the business of providing care support services and health support services in which the Company is engaged (the “Business”) is intensely competitive and that the Executive’s employment by the Company will require that the Executive have access to and knowledge of confidential information of the Company relating to its business plans, financial data, marketing programs, client information, contracts and other trade secrets, in each case other than as and to the extent such information is generally known or publicly available through no violation of this Agreement by the Executive;  
  
  


2.

the use or disclosure of such information other than in furtherance of the Business may place the Company at a competitive disadvantage and may do damage, monetary or otherwise, to the Business; and  
  
  


3.

the engaging by the Executive in any of the activities prohibited by this Section shall constitute improper appropriation and/or use of such information. The Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Company’s confidential information and that the confidential information constitutes a protectable business interest of the Company. Other than as may be required in the performance of his duties, Executive expressly agrees not to divulge such confidential information to anyone outside the Company without prior permission.  
  
  


B.

The “Company” (which shall be construed to include the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective affiliates) and the Executive agree that for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Date of Termination if the Executive’s employment is terminated under Sections VI(C), (D), (E), (F) or (H), and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Date of Termination if the Executive’s employment is terminated under Section VI(G), the Executive shall not:  
  
  


1.

engage in Competition, as defined below, with the Company or its subsidiaries within any market where the Company is conducting the Business at the time of termination of the Executive’s employment hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, “Competition” by the Executive shall mean the Executive’s being employed by or acting as a consultant or lender to, or being a director, officer, employee, principal, agent, stockholder, member, owner or partner of, or permitting his name to be used in connection with the activities of any entity engaged in the Business, provided that, it shall not be a violation of this sub-paragraph for the Executive to become the registered or beneficial owner of less than five percent (5%) of any class of the capital stock of any one or more competing corporations registered under the 1934 Act, provided that, the Executive does not participate in the business of su ch corporation until such time as this covenant expires; and  
  
  


2.

the Executive further agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, for his benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity, do any of the following:  
  
  


a.

solicit from any customer, doing business with the Company as of the Executive’s termination, business of the same or of a similar nature to the Business of the Company with such customer;  
  
  


b.

solicit from any known potential customer of the Company business of the same or of a similar nature to that which, to the knowledge of the Executive, has been the subject of a written or oral bid, offer or proposal by the Company, or of substantial preparation with a view to making such a bid, proposal or offer, within eighteen (18) months prior to the Executive’s termination; or  
  
  


c.

recruit or solicit the employment or services of any person who was employed by the Company upon termination of the Executive’s employment and is employed by the Company at the time of such recruitment or solicitation.  
  
  


3.

The Executive acknowledges that the services to be rendered by him to the Company are of a special and unique character, which causes this Agreement to be of significant value to the Company, the loss of which may not be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages in an action at law, and that a breach or threatened breach by him of any of the provisions contained in this Section will cause the Company irreparable injury. The Executive therefore agrees that the Company will be entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy, to a temporary, preliminary and permanent injunction, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages or the posting of any bond or security, enjoining or restraining the Executive from any such violation or threatened violations. The Executive acknowledges that the terms of this Section IX and its obligations are reasonable and will not prohibit him from being employed or employable in the health care industry.  
  
  


C.

If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be held to be excessively broad as to duration, activity or subject, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and reducing them so as to be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
  
  


X.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with Exhibit A attached hereto, contains all the understandings between the parties pertaining to the matters referred to herein, and supersedes any other undertakings and agreements, whether oral or written, previously entered into by them with respect thereto. The Executive represents that, in executing this Agreement, he does not rely and has not relied upon any representation or statement not set forth herein made by the Company with regard to the subject matter or effect of this Agreement or otherwise and that Executive has had the opportunity to be represented by counsel of his choosing.  
  
  


XI.

AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION; WAIVER. No provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived, unless such amendment or waiver is agreed to in writing, signed by the Executive and by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
