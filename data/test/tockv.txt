TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

Manager’s employment with the Company may be terminated by Manager or by the Company at any time for any reason. Upon Manager’s termination of employment prior to the end of the term of the Agreement, the Company shall pay Manager as follows:

4.01 Termination by the Company for Other than Cause. If the Company terminates Manager’s employment for any reason other than Cause, the Company shall pay Manager the following:

(a) An amount equal to Manager’s monthly base salary in effect at the time of such termination of employment for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter. Such amount shall be paid to Manager periodically in accordance with the Company’s customary payroll practices for management employees.

(b) The base salary and accrued but unused paid vacation time earned through the date of termination and any incentive compensation earned for the preceding fiscal year that is not yet paid.

(c) Continued coverage for Manager and/or Manager’s family under the Company’s health plan pursuant to Title I, Part 6 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“COBRA”) and for such purpose the date of Manager’s termination of employment shall be considered the date of the “qualifying event” as such term is defined by COBRA. During the period beginning on the date of such termination and ending at the end of the period described in Section 4.01(a), Manager shall be charged for such coverage in the amount that he would have paid for such coverage had he remained employed by the Company, and for the duration of the COBRA period, Manager shall be charged for such coverage in accordance with the provisions of COBRA.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean Manager’s (i) conviction in a court of law of (or entering a plea of guilty or no contest to) any crime or offense involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust or involving a felony; (ii) performance of any act which, if known to the customers, clients, stockholders or regulators of the Company, would materially and adversely impact the business of the Company; (iii) act or omission that causes a regulatory body with jurisdiction over the Company to demand, request, or recommend that Manager be suspended or removed from any position in which Manager serves with the Company; (iv) substantial nonperformance of any of his obligations under this Agreement; (v) misappropriation of or intentional material damage to the property or business of the Company or any affiliate; or (vi) breach of Article Five or Six of this Agreement.

4.02 Termination Following a Change in Control. Notwithstanding Section 4.01, if, following a Change in Control, and prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, Manager’s employment is terminated by the Company (or any successor thereto) for any reason other than Cause, or if Manager terminates his employment because of a decrease in his then current base salary or a substantial diminution in his position and responsibilities, the Company (or any successor thereto) shall pay Manager the following:

(a) An amount equal to Manager’s monthly base salary in effect at the time of such termination for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter. Such amount shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s customary payroll practices for Manager employees.

(b) An amount equal to the incentive compensation earned by or paid to Manager for the fiscal year immediately preceding the year in which Manager’s termination of employment occurs. Such amount shall be paid to Manager in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the date of his termination.

(c) The base salary and accrued but unused paid vacation time earned through the date of termination and any incentive compensation earned for the preceding fiscal year that is not yet paid.

(d) Continued coverage for Manager and/or Manager’s family under the Company’s health plan pursuant to Title I, Part 6 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“COBRA”) and for such purpose the date of Manager’s termination of employment shall be considered the date of the “qualifying event” as such term is defined by COBRA. During the period beginning on the date of such termination and ending at the end of the period described in Section 4.02(a), Manager shall be charged for such coverage in the amount that he would have paid for such coverage had he remained employed by the Company, and for the duration of the COBRA period, Manager shall be charged for such coverage in accordance with the provisions of COBRA.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall have the meaning as set forth in the First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (or successor stock incentive plan maintained by the Company).

4.03 Other Termination of Employment. If, prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, the Company terminates Manager’s employment for Cause, or if Manager terminates his employment for any reason other than as described in Section 4.02 above, the Company shall pay Manager the base salary and accrued but unused paid vacation time earned through the date of such termination and any incentive compensation earned for the preceding fiscal year that is not yet paid.

4.04 Key Employee Status. If at the time of such termination of employment Manager is a “Key Employee” as defined in Section 416(i) of the Internal Revenue Code (without reference to paragraph 5 thereof), and the amounts payable to Manager pursuant to Article Four are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, payment of such amounts shall not commence until six months following Manager’s termination of employment, with the first payment to include the payments that otherwise would have been made during such six-month period.

ARTICLE FIVE

  


CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

5.01 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. During his employment with the Company, and after his termination of such employment with the Company, Manager shall not, in any form or manner, directly or indirectly, use, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, entity, firm, corporation or any other third party, any Confidential Information, except as required in the performance of Manager’s duties hereunder, as required by law or as necessary in conjunction with legal proceedings.

5.02 Definition of Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all information either developed by Manager during his employment with the Company and used by the Company or its affiliates or developed by or for the Company or its affiliates of which Manager gained knowledge by reason of his employment with the Company that is not readily available in or known to the general public or the industry in which the Company or any affiliate is or becomes engaged. Such Confidential Information shall include, but shall not be limited to, any technical or non-technical data, formulae, compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, procedures, manuals, financial data, business plans, lists of actual or potential customers, lists of employees and any information regarding the Company's or any affiliate’s products, marketing or database. The Company and Manager acknowledge and agree that such Confidential Information is extremely valuable to the Company and may constitute trade secret information under applicable law. In the event that any part of the Confidential Information becomes generally known to the public through legitimate origins (other than by the breach of this Agreement by Manager or by other misappropriation of the Confidential Information), that part of the Confidential Information shall no longer be deemed Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement, but Manager shall continue to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as to all other Confidential Information.

5.03 Delivery upon Termination. Upon termination of Manager's employment with the Company for any reason, Manager shall promptly deliver to the Company all correspondence, files, manuals, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, programs, plans, proposals, financial documents, and any other documents or data concerning the Company's or any affiliate’s customers, database, business plan, marketing strategies, processes or other materials which contain Confidential Information, together with all other property of the Company or any affiliate in Manager's possession, custody or control.

ARTICLE SIX

  


NON-COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION COVENANTS

6.01 Covenant Not to Compete. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following the later of the termination of Manager's employment for any reason or the last day of the term of the Agreement, Manager shall not, on behalf of himself or on behalf of another person, corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, within the counties of Coles, Moultrie, Douglas, Cumberland, Effingham, Champaign, Christian, Madison, Macon, Bond or Piatt, Illinois, or any other county in which the Company or any affiliate conducts business:

ARTICLE SEVEN

  


REMEDIES

Manager acknowledges that compliance with the provisions of Articles Five and Six herein is necessary to protect the business, goodwill and proprietary information of the Company and that a breach of these covenants will irreparably and continually damage the Company for which money damages may be inadequate. Consequently, Manager agrees that, in the event that he breaches or threatens to breach any of these provisions, the Company shall be entitled to both (a) a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction in order to prevent the continuation of such harm; and (b) money damages insofar as they can be determined. In addition, the Company will cease payment of all compensation and benefits under Articles Three and Four hereof. In the event that any of the provisions, covenants, warranties or agreements in this Agreement are held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction upon Manager or are otherwise invalid, for whatsoever cause, then the court so holding shall reduce, and is so authorized to reduce, the territory to which it pertains and/or the period of time in which it operates, or the scope of activity to which it pertains or effect any other change to the extent necessary to render any of the restrictions of this Agreement enforceable.

ARTICLE EIGHT
