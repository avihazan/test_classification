ARTICLE I

STOCKHOLDERS

SECTION 1.01. Annual Meeting. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business within its powers, either at 10:00 a.m. on the third Wednesday of April in each year, if not a legal holiday, or at such other time on such other day falling on or before the 30th day thereafter as shall be set by the Board of Directors. Except as the Charter or statute provides otherwise, any business may be considered at an annual meeting without the purpose of the meeting having been specified in the notice. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation’s existence or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts.

SECTION 1.02. Special Meeting. At any time in the interval between annual meetings, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or in writing (addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation) with or without a meeting. Special meetings of the stockholders shall be called by the Secretary at the request of the stockholders only on the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting and then only as may be required by law.

SECTION 1.03. Place of Meetings. Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place in the United States as is set, from time to time, by the Board of Directors.

SECTION 1.04. Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice. Not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before each stockholders’ meeting, the Secretary shall give written notice of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting and each other stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting. Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, or mailed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each person who is entitled to notice waives notice if he, before or after the meeting, signs a waiver of the notice, which is filed with the records of stockholders’ meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by proxy. A meeting of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned, from time to time, without further notice to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date.

SECTION 1.05. Quorum; Voting. Unless statute or the Charter provides otherwise and except as provided in Section 2.03 hereof, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders present, in person or by proxy, by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement, may adjourn the meeting, from time to time, until a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. In the event that at any meeting a quorum exists for the transaction of some business but does not exist for the transaction of other business, the business as to which a quorum is present may be transacted by the holders of stock present in person or by proxy who are entitled to vote thereon.

SECTION 1.06. General Right to Vote; Proxies. Unless the Charter provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. In all elections for directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. A stockholder may vote the stock he owns of record either in person or by written proxy signed by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than 11 months after its date.

SECTION 1.07. List of Stockholders. At each meeting of stockholders, a full, true and complete list of all stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, showing the number and class of shares held by each and certified by the transfer agent for such class or by the Secretary, shall be furnished by the Secretary.

SECTION 1.08. Conduct of Voting. At all meetings of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by judges, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided, by the chairman of the meeting. If demanded by stockholders, present in person or by proxy, entitled to cast 10 percent of the number of total votes that are entitled to be cast, or if ordered by the chairman, the vote upon any election or question shall be taken by ballot and, upon like demand or order, the voting shall be conducted by two inspectors, in which event the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by the inspectors. Unless so demanded or ordered, no vote need be by ballot, and voting need not be conducted by inspectors. The stockholders at any meeting may choose an inspector or inspectors to act at such meeting and, in default of such election, the chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors. No candidate for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector thereat.

SECTION 1.09. Informal Action by Stockholders. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting if there is filed with the records of stockholders’ meetings a unanimous written consent which sets forth the action and is signed by each stockholder entitled to vote on the matter and a written waiver of any right to dissent signed by each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting but not entitled to vote at it.

SECTION 1.10. Nominations of Directors. In addition to any other requirements, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be made at a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected exclusively in accordance with this Section. Nominations of persons for such elections shall be deemed properly made if (i) set forth in proxy materials prepared for such a meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) made by a stockholder at such a meeting at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) made by a stockholder at such a meeting (other than at the direction of the Board of Directors) if timely notice has been given to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation of such intent to make a nomination. To be timely, such stockholder’s notice must be received by the Corporation not less than 75 days prior to the date of the stockholders’ meeting; provided, however, that if less than 100 days’ notice or prior disclosure of the date of the stockholders’ meeting is given or made to the stockholders by the Corporation, then notice by the stockholder of intent to make a nomination must be received by the Corporation no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the Corporation mailed the notice of the date of the meeting or published or otherwise made public disclosure of such meeting date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the “date of the stockholder meeting” is the date when the meeting is first convened, even if the meeting is adjourned one or more times to a later date or dates.

Such stockholders’ notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, if any, and (iv) any other information relating to such person which is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor act or Regulation; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of the stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may be reasonably required by the Corporation to determine the qualifications of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.

No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10. These procedures shall not apply to the nomination of any persons entitled to be separately elected by holders of Preferred Stock. The chairman of a stockholders’ meeting may determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination has not been made in accordance with the foregoing procedure and that such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

SECTION 1.11. Stockholder Proposals. In addition to any other requirements, any motions, resolutions, or proposals by stockholders (hereinafter “proposals”) made at a meeting of stockholders shall be exclusively in accordance with this Section. Proposals shall be deemed properly made if (i) set forth in proxy materials prepared for such a meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) made by a stockholder at such a meeting at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) made by a stockholder at such a meeting (other than at the direction of the Board of Directors) if timely notice has been given to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation of such intent to make the proposal. To be timely, such stockholder’s notice must be received by the Corporation not less than 75 days prior to the date of the stockholders’ meeting; provided, however, that if less than 100 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date is given or made to the stockholders by the Corporation, then notice by the stockholder of intent to make the proposal must be received by the Corporation no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the Corporation mailed the notice of the date of the meeting or published or otherwise made public disclosure of such meeting date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the “date of the stockholder meeting” is the date when the meeting is first convened, even if the meeting is adjourned one or more times to a later date or dates.

Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth a brief description of any proposal the stockholder intends to make, the reasons for bringing such proposal before the meeting, the name and address of the stockholder, and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and any material interest of the stockholder in the subject of the proposal.

No stockholder shall make a proposal at a stockholder meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.11. The chairman of a stockholder meeting may determine and declare to the meeting that a proposal has not been made in accordance with the foregoing procedure and that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

SECTION 2.01. Function of Directors. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors. All powers of the Corporation may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as conferred on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or by the Charter or Bylaws.

SECTION 2.02. Number of Directors. The Corporation shall have at least three directors; provided that, if there is no stock outstanding, the number of directors may be less than three but not less than one; and, if there is stock outstanding and so long as there are less than three stockholders, the number of directors may be less than three but not less than the number of stockholders. The Corporation shall have the number of directors provided in the Charter until changed as herein provided. A majority of the entire Board of Directors may alter the number of directors set by the Charter to not exceeding 25 nor less than the minimum number then permitted herein, but the action may not affect the tenure of office of any director.

SECTION 2.03. Election and Tenure of Directors. At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualify. At any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, each nominee for election as a director shall be elected if the number of votes cast for the nominee’s election exceeds the number of votes cast against the nominee’s election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected if pursuant to Section 1.10 of these Bylaws the number of director candidates to be nominated at such meeting exceeds the number of directors to be elected or if a stockholder has submitted notice of an intent to nominate a candidate for election in accordance with Section 1.10 of these Bylaws unless, on or before the seventh business day prior to the date that the Corporation files with the Securities and Exchange Commission its definitive proxy statement relating to such meeting (regardless of whether thereafter revised or supplemented), such notice has been (a) withdrawn in writing to the Secretary, (b) determined by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) pursuant to the Bylaws, or, if challenged in court, by a final court order, not to be a valid and effective notice of nomination, or (c) determined by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) not to create a bona fide election contest. No director shall stand for election upon reaching the age of 74 by the date of the meeting of stockholders at which his/or nomination will be considered by stockholders.

SECTION 2.04. Removal of Director. The stockholders may remove any director, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors.

SECTION 2.05. Vacancy on Board. The stockholders may elect a successor to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from the removal of a director. A majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from any cause except an increase in the number of directors, and a majority of the entire Board of Directors may fill a vacancy which results from an increase in the number of directors. A director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualifies. A director elected by the stockholders to fill a vacancy which results from the removal of a director serves for the balance of the term of the removed director.

SECTION 2.06. Regular Meetings. After each meeting of stockholders at which a Board of Directors shall have been elected, the Board of Directors so elected shall meet as soon as practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business; and in the event that no other time is designated by the stockholders, the Board of Directors shall meet one hour after the time for such stockholders’ meeting or immediately following the close of such stockholders’ meeting on the day of such meeting. Such first regular meeting shall be held at any place as may be designated by the stockholders, or in default of such designation, at the place designated by the Board of Directors for such first regular meeting, or in default of such designation, at the place of the holding of the immediately preceding meeting of stockholders. No notice of such first meeting shall be necessary if held as hereinabove provided. Any other regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated, from time to time, by the Board of Directors.

SECTION 2.07. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting, or in writing with or without a meeting. A special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place in or out of the state of Maryland as may be designated, from time to time, by the Board of Directors. In the absence of designation, such meeting shall be held at such place as may be designated in the call.

SECTION 2.08. Notice of Meeting. Except as provided in Section 2.06, the Secretary shall give notice to each director of each regular and special meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting. Notice is given to a director when it is delivered personally to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, or sent by telegraph or telephone at least 24 hours before the time of the meeting or, in the alternative, by mail to his address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation at least 72 hours before the time of the meeting. Unless the Bylaws or a resolution of the Board of Directors provides otherwise, the notice need not state the business to be transacted at or the purposes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. No notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who attends or to any director who, in writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice. Any meeting of the Board of Directors, regular or special, may adjourn, from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other than by announcement.

SECTION 2.09. Action by Directors. Unless statute or the Charter or Bylaws require a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is action of the Board of Directors. A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present, by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement, may adjourn the meeting, from time to time, until a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if a unanimous written consent which sets forth the action is signed by each member of the Board and filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board.

SECTION 2.10. Meeting by Conference Telephone. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.
