Pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Remuneration and Expense Reimbursement Summary, approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), the Compensation Committee of the Board has approved a grant of restricted stock units (“Restricted Units”) as an inducement for the Grantee to promote the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. A copy of the Plan is available at https://innerweb.novell.com/organizations/finance/shareholder_services/. 

B. The Plan is administered by the Committee (as defined in the Plan).

1\. Grant of Restricted Units. The Company hereby grants the Grantee  Restricted Units. The Restricted Units are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. 

2\. Restricted Unit Account. Restricted Units represent hypothetical shares of common stock of the Company (“Shares”), and not actual Shares. The Company shall establish and maintain a Restricted Unit account, as a bookkeeping account on its records, for the Grantee and shall record in such account the number of Restricted Units granted to the Grantee. No Shares shall be issued to the Grantee at the time the grant is made, and the Grantee shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Restricted Units recorded in the account. The Grantee shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets of the Company by reason of this award or the Restricted Unit account established for the Grantee. 

3\. Vesting.

Except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs 3(b) or 3(c) below, the Restricted Units shall vest in full upon the earlier to occur of one year from the date of grant or the business day prior to the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders following the grant date, provided that the Grantee is a Director (as defined in the Plan) of the Company on such dates.

(b) Immediately upon the Grantee’s death while a Director of the Company, each of the Grantee’s outstanding, unvested Restricted Units shall vest with respect to all Restricted Units that would have vested during the twelve (12) months following such death if the Grantee had remained a Director of the Company. 

(c) Immediately upon the effective date of the Retirement (as defined below) of the Grantee (i.e., the last date of the Grantee’s service as a Director of the Company), each of the Grantee’s outstanding, unvested Restricted Units shall vest. For purposes hereof, “Retirement” separation from the Board under circumstances determined from time to time or in any specific instance by the Committee to constitute retirement. 

4\. Termination of Restricted Units. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 3 above, if the Grantee ceases to serve as a Director for any reason before all of the Restricted Units vest, any unvested Restricted Units shall automatically terminate and shall be forfeited as of the date of the Grantee’s termination as a Director.

All obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be subject to the rights of the Company to withhold amounts required to be withheld for any taxes, if applicable. 

(c) The obligation of the Company to deliver Shares when Restricted Units vest shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the Committee, including such actions as Company counsel shall deem necessary or appropriate to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations. 

6\. Change of Control. If a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan) occurs, the provisions of the Plan applicable to a Change of Control shall apply to the Restricted Units; provided, however, that if the Restricted Units are subject to the requirements of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Restricted Units shall be paid to the Grantee upon the Change of Control only if the transaction constituting the Change of Control is a “change in control event” within the meaning of section 409A of the Code. If the transaction constituting a Change of Control is not a “change in control event” within the meaning of section 409A of the Code, the Restricted Units shall be paid to the Grantee within thirty (30) days following the earlier of (a) the date the Restricted Units are otherwise scheduled to vest pursuant to Section 3 above or (b) the date the Grantee ceases to be a Director.

and this Agreement; (ii) the grant of the Restricted Units does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of restricted stock units, or benefits in lieu of restricted stock units, even if restricted stock units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (iii) all decisions with respect to future restricted stock unit grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Board; (iv) the Grantee is voluntarily participating in the Plan; (v) in the event that the Grantee is not an employee of the Company, an Affiliate, or a Subsidiary, the Restricted Units grant will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company or with any Affiliate or Subsidiary; (vi) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; and (vii) the value of Shares acquired upon vesting may increase or decrease in value, and no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of Restricted Units or from any diminution in value of the Restricted Units or Shares received upon vesting of Restricted Units, and the Grantee irrevocably releases the Company and all Affiliates and Subsidiaries from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by signing this Agreement, the Grantee shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived his or her entitlement to pursue such claim. 

8\. Grant Subject to Plan Provisions.

The Committee shall have the authority to interpret and construe the Restricted Units pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and its decisions shall be conclusive as to any questions arising hereunder.

10\. Assignment and Transfers. Except as the Committee may otherwise permit pursuant to the Plan, the rights and interests of the Grantee under this Agreement may not be sold, assigned, encumbered or otherwise transferred except, in the event of the death of the Grantee, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of any attempt by the Grantee to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Units or any right hereunder, except as provided for in this Agreement, or in the event of the levy or any attachment, execution or similar process upon the rights or interests hereby conferred, the Company may terminate the Restricted Units by notice to the Grantee, and the Restricted Units and all rights hereunder shall thereupon become null and void. The rights and protections of the Company hereunder shall extend to any successors or assigns of the Company and to the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates.
