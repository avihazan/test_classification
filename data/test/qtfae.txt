Each of the Company and each subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
