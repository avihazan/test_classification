GREAT LAKES DREDGE & DOCK CORPORATION 

STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING 

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RECOUPMENT 

Overview. This Policy Statement has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). The Company has adopted this incentive compensation recoupment policy (the “Policy”) in order to ensure that Incentive Compensation (as defined below) is paid based on accurate financial data. Under the circumstances described below, the Company may seek to recover Incentive Compensation that would have not been paid if the correct performance data had been used to determine the amount payable. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (the “Committee”) shall have full authority to interpret and enforce the Policy and may recommend that the Board of Directors take action with respect to the Policy. The Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation awarded to Covered Employees regardless of individual fault, and is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee may amend or terminate this Policy at any time. 

Covered Employees. The Policy applies to the following (each a “Covered Employee”): (i) the current and former executive officers of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, as determined from time to time pursuant to Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) any other employee of the Company or any Affiliate, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, designated by the Board or the Committee from time to time by notice to the employee. 

Incentive Compensation. For purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means, with respect to each Covered Employee: (i) performance bonuses and incentive awards (including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or other stock-based awards) paid, granted, vested or accrued under any Company plan or agreement or plan or agreement of an Affiliate of the Company in the form of cash or Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation common stock, (ii) outstanding incentive awards that have not vested or been earned, and (iii) in cases of fraud or misconduct, the gain realized by any Covered Employee engaged in such conduct on the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights, the vesting of other incentive awards, or the sale of Company stock acquired through any incentive award. 

Triggering Events; Calculation of Overpayment. If the Committee determines that Incentive Compensation was overpaid, in whole or in part, as a result of (i) a restatement of the Company’s reported financial or operating results (unless due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law) or (ii) any conduct justifying termination for cause under the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or the applicable Covered Employee’s employment agreement, or constituting a violation of a restrictive covenant in an employment or severance agreement, or other act involving, dishonesty, fraud, illegality or moral turpitude (whether or not requiring a restatement), the Committee will review the Incentive Compensation paid, granted, vested or accrued. To the extent practicable and in the best interests of stockholders, and as permitted by 

* * *

applicable law, (i) in the event of a restatement, the Committee will seek to recover or cancel the difference between any Incentive Compensation that was based on having met or exceeded performance targets that would not have been met based upon accurate financial data and the Incentive Compensation that would have been paid or granted to such Covered Employee or the Incentive Compensation in which such Covered Employee would have vested had the actual payment, granting or vesting been calculated based on the accurate data or restated results, as applicable, and (ii) in the event of other misconduct, provided that such misconduct was harmful to the Company or an Affiliate, the Committee may seek to recover or cancel Incentive Compensation paid, awarded or accrued after the applicable misconduct or any severance paid after termination of employment (in any such case, the “Overpayment”). 

Forms of Recovery. The Company shall have the right to demand the reimbursement of any Overpayment. To the extent the Covered Employee does not reimburse any Overpayment, the Company shall have the right to sue for repayment and enforce the repayment through the reduction or cancellation of outstanding and future Incentive Compensation. To the extent any shares have been issued under vested awards or such shares have been sold by the Covered Employee, the Company shall have the right to cancel any other outstanding stock-based awards with a value equivalent to the Overpayment, as determined by the Company. 

Time Period for Overpayment Review. The Committee may make determinations of Overpayment at any time through the end of the third fiscal year following the year for which the inaccurate performance criteria were measured (the “Overpayment Review Period”); provided, that if steps have been taken within such period to restate the Company’s financial or operating results, the Overpayment Review Period shall be extended until such restatement is completed. For illustrative purposes only, this means that if incentive compensation is paid in early 2011 for performance metrics based on fiscal year 2010 performance, such compensation shall be subject to review for Overpayment until the end of the Company’s 2013 fiscal year. Notwithstanding the above, if the Committee determines that any Covered Employee engaged in fraud or misconduct, the Committee shall be entitled to determine the Overpayment with respect to such Covered Employee for a period of six years after the act of fraud or misconduct is discovered. 

No Additional Payments. In no event shall the Company be required to award Covered Employees an additional payment if the restated or accurate financial results would have resulted in a higher incentive compensation payment. 

Applicability. This Policy applies to all Incentive Compensation, whether paid or granted prior to the adoption of the Policy, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or any other legal obligation of the Company or Affiliate, as the case may be. Application of the Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Employee’s obligations to the Company, including termination of employment or institution of civil or criminal proceedings. 

Committee Determination Final. Any determination by the Committee (or by any officer of the Company or an Affiliate to whom enforcement authority has been delegated) or the Board of Directors with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties.

Disclosure. This policy shall be disclosed in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation’s applicable filings with the Securities Exchange Commission discussing executive compensation subject hereto.
