The business to be transacted at the annual meeting shall include the election of directors, consideration of the report of the President, and any other business properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws.

  


Section 2.

SPECIAL MEETINGS  
  
  


A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time for any purpose(s) by the Chairman of the Board, the President or by a majority of the total number of Directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies on the Board of Directors. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request of the holders of a majority of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote on the business to be transacted at such meeting. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Secretary of the Corporation shall not be obligated to call a special meeting of the stockholders requested by stockholders for the purpose of taking any action that is non-binding or advisory in nature. Business transacted at any special meeting shall be confined to the purpose(s) stated in the notice of such meeting.

  


Section 3.

NOTICE OF MEETING; WAIVER OF NOTICE  
  
  


Not less than ten (10) days nor more than ninety (90) days before the date of every stockholders meeting, the Secretary shall give to each stockholder entitled to vote at or to notice of such meeting, written notice stating the place, date and time of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called, either by mail to his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation or by presenting it to him or her personally or by leaving it at his or her residence or usual place of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, a written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person entitled to notice at a meeting, in person or by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

  


When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided however, that if the date of the adjourned meeting is more than 120 days after the record date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice

At any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy (after giving effect to the provisions of Article FIFTH of the Articles of Incorporation), shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law.

  


If a quorum fails to attend any meeting, the Chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting to any place, date and time without further notice to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date.

In the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman appoints.

  


Section 7.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  
  
  


(a) The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him or her in order. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting.

  


(b) At any annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote with respect thereto and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7(b). For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the business must relate to a proper subject matter for stockholder action and the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that if less than one hundred (100) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. A stockholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock that are beneficially owned by such stockholder, (iv) a statement disclosing (A) whether such stockholder is acting with or on behalf of any other person and (B) if applicable, the identity of such person, and (v) any material interest of such stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be brought before or conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(b). The Chairman of the Board or other person presiding over the 

* * *

annual meeting shall, if the facts so warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(b) and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business so determined to be not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  


At any special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with Article I, Section 2.

  


(c) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7(c). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made by timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the meeting; provided, however, that if less than one hundred (100) days’ notice or prior disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom such stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such person that would indicate such person’s qualification under Article II, Section 3, including an affidavit that such person would not be disqualified under the provisions of Section 3(b) and such information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (A) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, of such stockholder, (B) the class and number of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock that are beneficially owned by such stockholder, and (C) a statement disclosing (1) whether such stockholder or any nominee thereof is acting with or on behalf of any other person and (2) if applicable, the identity of such person.

All voting, including on the election of directors but excepting where otherwise required by law or by the governing documents of the Corporation, may be made by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a stockholder entitled to vote or his or her proxy, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballot, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedures established for the meeting. The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.

Any facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the stockholder. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the stockholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the Board of Directors.
