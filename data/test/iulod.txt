Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Stockholders may be called at any time by the President (as hereinafter defined) and shall be called by the President upon the request in writing or by vote of a majority of the Directors, or Stockholders of record owning a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

Section 2.6 Vote Required.

All consents properly delivered in accordance with this section shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those Stockholders who have not consented in writing.

In every instance where an attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the Stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place of business.

Section 8.8 Waiver of Notice. A written waiver of any notice, signed by a Stockholder, Director, officer, employee or agent, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such Stockholder, Director, officer, employee or agent. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

Section 8.9 Section Headings. Section headings in these Bylaws are for convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect in limiting or otherwise construing any provision herein.

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.1 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (“Proceeding”), including without limitation, Proceedings by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that he or she or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director or officer of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith. Such right shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation for expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a Director or officer of the Corporation in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a Director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such Director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise.

Section 10.2 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 10.1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its Stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual 

  


9

  


  


* * *

  


determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its Stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that claimant had not met the applicable standard of conduct.

Section 10.3 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred by Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, vote of the Stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.

Section 10.4 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any such Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
