(c) Subject to early termination of this Award Agreement pursuant to Section 4 or below, as soon as practicable, but no later than 90 days following the end of the Performance Period, the Company will pay to Participant the Performance Unit Award amount, if any, determined pursuant to Section 3(b) above. Such amount shall be paid in Company common stock.

6. Tax Withholding. Participant shall pay all applicable federal, state, local and foreign withholding taxes that the Company is required to withhold at any time with respect to the Performance Unit Award.
