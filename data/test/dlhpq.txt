STOCKHOLDERS’ MEETINGS

1\. Time and Place of Meetings. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of Directors or for any other purpose will be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary, and stated in the notice of meeting. The Board of Directors may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders. 

2\. Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of the stockholders will be held at such date and time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, at which meeting the stockholders will elect by a plurality vote the Directors to succeed those whose terms expire at such meeting and will transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with Bylaw 8. 

3\. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by (a) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and (b) the Secretary within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written request of a majority of the whole Board of Directors. Any such request by a majority of the whole Board of Directors must be sent to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Secretary and must state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Special meetings of holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock, if any, may be called in the manner and for the purposes provided in the applicable Preferred Stock Designation. 

4\. Notice of Meetings. Written notice of every meeting of the stockholders, stating the place, date, and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, will be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 calendar days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting must be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which properly could have been transacted at the original meeting. 

5\. Inspectors. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more inspectors of election to act as judges of the voting and to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, in advance of such meeting. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer of the meeting may appoint one or more substitute inspectors. 

6\. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or in a Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business thereat. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any 

1

* * *

##### 

meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. 

7\. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or in a Preferred Stock Designation, each stockholder will be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the Company on the record date for the meeting and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Secretary. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary. The vote upon any question brought before a meeting of the stockholders may be by voice vote, unless otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws or unless the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting otherwise determine. Every vote taken by written ballot will be counted by the inspectors of election. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and which has actually been voted will be the act of the stockholders, except in the election of Directors or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation, a Preferred Stock Designation, or by law. 

8\. Order of Business. (a) The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or such other officer of the Company designated by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, will call meetings of the stockholders to order and will act as presiding officer thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of the stockholders will also determine the order of business and have the authority in his or her sole discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the Company or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such stockholders’ meeting, by ascertaining whether any stockholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of the stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of the stockholders. 

(b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors in accordance with Bylaw 4, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the whole Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder in accordance with Bylaw 8(c). 

(c) In order to properly submit any business to an annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder must give timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be considered timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered either in person or by United States certified mail, postage

prepaid, and received at the principal executive offices of the Company (a) not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary date of the Company’s proxy statement in connection with the last annual meeting of stockholders or (b) if no annual meeting has been called after the expiration of more than 30 days from the date for such meeting contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, not less than a reasonable time, as determined by the Board of Directors, prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting. 

The Secretary of the Company will deliver any stockholder proposals and nominations received in a timely manner for review by the Board of Directors or a committee designated by the Board of Directors. 

A stockholder’s notice to submit business to an annual meeting of stockholders will set forth (i) the name and address of the stockholder, (ii) the class and number of shares of stock beneficially owned by such stockholder, (iii) the name in which such shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, (iv) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear at the meeting in person or by proxy to submit the business specified in such notice, (v) any material interest of the stockholder in the business to be submitted, and (vi) a brief description of the business desired to be submitted to the annual meeting, including the complete text of any resolutions to be presented at the annual meeting, and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting. In addition, the stockholder making such proposal will promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Company. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw 8(c), a stockholder who seeks to have any proposal included in the Company’s proxy statement will comply with the requirements of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

(d) At a special meeting of stockholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a majority of the whole Board of Directors in accordance with Bylaw 4, or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the whole Board of Directors. 

(e) The determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special meeting of the stockholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Bylaw will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is not properly brought before such meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered. 

DIRECTORS

9\. Function. The business and affairs of the Company will be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors. 

10\. Number, Election, and Terms. (a) Subject to the rights, if any, of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation 

3

* * *

##### 

and to the minimum and maximum number of authorized Directors provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the authorized number of Directors may be determined from time to time only by a vote of a majority of the whole Board of Directors. The Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock, will be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to the contrary, the term of any Director who is also an officer of the Company will terminate automatically, without any further action on the part of the Board of Directors or such Director, upon the termination for any reason of such Director in his or her capacity as an officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to the contrary, the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Directors then in office will be required to amend, repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with this Bylaw 10(b). 

11\. Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of Directors will be filled by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of the Company or the affirmative vote of the remaining board members, not including those filling the positions of the newly created directorships. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors to fill a vacancy, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause will be filled for the remainder of the term of the vacating director by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of the Company, by the affirmative vote of the remaining board members (even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors or by a sole remaining Director) or by the Chairman of the Board of the Company, except that if the vacancy is created with respect to a Director who at such time was also the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary or Treasurer of the Company, then that vacancy will be filled only by the Chairman of the Board. Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding two sentences will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director’s successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors will shorten the term of an incumbent Director. 

12\. Removal. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, any Director may be removed from office by the stockholders only for cause and only in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. 

13\. Nominations of Directors; Election. (a) Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures will be eligible for election at a meeting of stockholders as Directors of the Company. 

(b) Nominations of persons for election as Directors of the Company may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any 

4

* * *

##### 

stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw 13, who is entitled to vote for the election of Directors at such meeting, and who complies with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw 13. All nominations by stockholders must be made pursuant to timely notice in proper written form to the Secretary. 

(c) Nominations by stockholders, if made, must be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice will be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company (a) with respect to an election to be held at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, not less than 120 nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, and (b) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders of the Company for the election of Directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed to stockholders of the Company or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. 

Such stockholder’s notice to the Secretary will set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected), and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Company’s books, of such stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of voting stock of the Company which are beneficially owned by such stockholder. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a Director will furnish to the Secretary of the Company that information required to be set forth in a stockholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. In the event that a person is validly designated as a nominee to the Board of Directors in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw 13(c) and thereafter becomes unable or unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or the stockholder who proposed such nominee, as the case may be, may designate a substitute nominee. 

The presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders will, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he will so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination will be disregarded. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw 13(c), a stockholder will also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Bylaw 13(c). 

14\. Resignation. Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his resignation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Secretary. Any resignation will be effective upon actual receipt by any such person or, if later, as of the date and time specified in such written notice.

15\. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held immediately after the annual meeting of the stockholders and at such other time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. Notice of regular meetings of the Board of Directors need not be given. 

16\. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer on one day’s notice to each Director by whom such notice is not waived, given either personally or by mail, telephone, telegram, telex, facsimile, or similar medium of communication, and will be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer in like manner and on like notice on the written request of five or more Directors. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as is determined by the Board of Directors or specified in the notice of any such meeting. 

17\. Quorum. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of Directors then in office will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except for the designation of committees as hereinafter provided and except for actions required by these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation to be taken by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, the act of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time to another place, time, or date, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. 

18\. Participation in Meetings by Telephone Conference. Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or any such committee, as the case may be, by means of telephone conference or similar means by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting will constitute presence in person at the meeting. 

19\. Committees. (a) The Board of Directors, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, may designate one or more directorate committees, each such committee to consist of one or more Directors and each to have such lawfully delegable powers and duties as the Board of Directors may confer. 

(b) Each committee of the Board of Directors will serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors or as may be specified in any resolution from time to time adopted by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of such committee. In lieu of such action by the Board of Directors, in the absence or disqualification of any member of a committee of the Board of Directors, the members thereof present at any such meeting of such committee and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or by law, any committee of the Board of Directors, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, will have and may 

6

* * *

##### 

exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the direction of the management of the business and affairs of the Company. Any such committee designated by the Board of Directors will have such name as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors or in the charter of the respective committee approved by the Board of Directors, a majority of the members of any committee of the Board of Directors will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of such committee. Each committee of the Board of Directors may prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings and its method of procedure, subject to any rules prescribed by the Board of Directors, and will keep a written record of all actions taken by it. 

20\. Compensation. The Board of Directors may establish the compensation for, and reimbursement of the expenses of, Directors for membership on the Board of Directors and on committees of the Board of Directors, attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or committees of the Board of Directors, and for other services by Directors of the Company or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries. 

21\. Rules. The Board of Directors may adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings and the oversight of the management of the affairs of the Company. 

NOTICES

22\. Generally. Except as otherwise provided by law, these Bylaws, or the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever by law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any Director or stockholder, it will not be construed to require personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such Director or stockholder, at the address of such Director or stockholder as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice will be deemed to be given at the time when the same is deposited in the United States mail. Notice to Directors may also be given by telephone, telegram, telex, facsimile, or similar medium of communication or as otherwise may be permitted by these Bylaws. 

23\. Waivers. Whenever any notice is required to be given by law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, will be deemed equivalent to such notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 

OFFICERS

24\. Generally. The officers of the Company will be elected by the Board of Directors and will consist of a Chairman of the Board of Directors (who, if the Board of Directors so specifies, may but 

7

* * *

##### 

will not be required to be also the Chief Executive Officer), a Chief Executive Officer, a President (who may also be the Chief Executive Officer and/or Chief Operating Officer), a Secretary, and a Treasurer. The Board of Directors may also choose any or all of the following: one or more Vice Chairmen of the Board of Directors, one or more Assistants to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a Chief Operating Officer, one or more Vice Presidents (who may be given particular designations with respect to authority, function, or seniority), and such other officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by specific action the Board of Directors may authorize the Chairman of the Board of Directors to appoint any person to any office other than Chairman and may authorize the Chief Executive Officer to appoint any person to any office other than Chairman, President, Secretary or Treasurer. Any number of offices may be held by the same person. Any of the offices may be left vacant from time to time as the Board of Directors may determine. In the case of the absence or disability of any officer of the Company or for any other reason deemed sufficient by a majority of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may delegate the absent or disabled officer’s powers or duties to any other officer or to any Director. 

25\. Compensation. The compensation of all officers and agents of the Company who are also Directors of the Company will be fixed by the Board of Directors or by a committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may fix, or delegate the power to fix, the compensation of other officers and agents of the Company to an officer of the Company. 

26\. Succession. The officers of the Company will hold office until their successors are elected and qualified. The Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, any Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary and Treasurer may be removed from office at any time by the Chairman and any other officers may be removed at any time by the Chief Executive Officer. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board of Directors as provided in Bylaw 24. 

27\. Authority and Duties. Each of the officers of the Company will have such authority and will perform all duties as are customarily incident to their respective offices or as may be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors. 

STOCK

28\. Certificates. Certificates representing shares of stock of the Company will be in such form as from time to time may be determined by the Board of Directors, subject to applicable legal requirements. The Board of Directors of the Company may provide by resolution that some or all of any class or series of the Company’s shares of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any physical share certificate will be numbered and its issuance recorded in the books of the Company, and such certificate will exhibit the holder’s name and the number of shares and will be signed by, or in the name of, the Company by the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, and will also be signed by, or bear the facsimile signature of, a duly authorized officer or agent of any properly designated transfer agent of the Company. Any or all of the signatures and the seal of the Company, if any, upon such certificates may be facsimiles, engraved, or printed. Such certificates may be issued and delivered notwithstanding that the person whose facsimile signature appears thereon may have ceased to be such officer at the time the certificates are issued and delivered. 

8

##### 

29\. Classes of Stock. The designations, preferences, and relative participating, optional, or other special rights of the various classes of stock or series thereof, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, will be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of any certificates which the Company issues and in the records of the transfer agent if such shares are uncertificated. Any physical share certificates issued by the Company will set forth the office of the Company from which the holders of certificates may obtain a copy of such information. 

30\. Transfers. Stock of the Company shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Company, and in the case of certificated shares of stock, only by the person named in the certificate or by such person’s attorney lawfully constituted in writing and upon the surrender of the certificate therefore, properly endorsed for transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; or, in the case of uncertificated shares of stock, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such person’s attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and endorsement, compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the Company shall determine to waive such requirement. With respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the Company shall be marked “Cancelled,” with the date of cancellation, by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company or the transfer agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Company for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Company by an entry showing from and to whom transferred. 

31\. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. The Secretary may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, satisfactory to the Secretary, by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the Secretary may require the owners of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates to give the Company a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Secretary may direct as indemnity against any claims that may be made against the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed or the issuance of the new certificate. 

32\. Record Dates. (a) In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which will not be more than 60 nor less than 10 calendar days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders will be at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the calendar day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders will apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date will not be more than 60 calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose will be at the close of business on the calendar day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

(c) The Company will be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, and will not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Company has notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law. 

INDEMNIFICATION

Such indemnification will be a contract right and will include the right to receive payment in advance of any expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by this Bylaw 33 or otherwise.

(c) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Bylaw 33 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.
