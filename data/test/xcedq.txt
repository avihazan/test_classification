Employment Agreement dated as of March 20, 2007, between PHARMOS CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation (with its successors and assigns, referred to as the “Corporation”) and ELKAN R. GAMZU (hereinafter referred to as “GAMZU”).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The Corporation desires to employ GAMZU as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, and GAMZU wishes to be employed by the Corporation, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Corporation and GAMZU also wish to enter into the other agreements set forth in this Agreement, all of which are related to GAMZU’s employment under this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

GAMZU and the Corporation therefore agree as follows:

1\.  Commencement of Employment: Term. The parties acknowledge that Gamzu commenced employment with the Corporation on February 26, 2007 (the “Commencement Date”) for the period commencing on such date and ending on the date terminated by either or both of the parties in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the “Term”). The termination of the Term for any reason shall end GAMZU’s employment under this Agreement, but, except as otherwise set forth herein, shall not terminate GAMZU’s or the Corporation’s other agreements in this Agreement.

2\.  Position and Duties.  Since the Commencement Date, GAMZU has been serving as the “CEO designate” of the Corporation, involved in a transition with the Corporation’s current Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Starting on March 31, 2007, GAMZU shall serve as the CEO. GAMZU shall also hold such additional positions and titles with the Corporation and its subsidiaries as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) may determine from time to time. GAMZU shall report to the Board. During the Term, GAMZU shall devote his full time and attention to performing his duties as an employee of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing sentence shall not restrict GAMZU from engaging in the following activities for the following privately-held companies: (i) serving as the Principal of enERGetics Biopharmaceutical Consultancy, LLC, (ii) serving as a consultant to and/or the Chairman of the Board or a Director of NeuroHealing Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (iii) serving as the non-executive President and Director of AviTx, Inc. and (iv) serving as a Director of Neurotech S.A. (France). Additionally, GAMZU may serve in similar capacities with other companies or organizations, and may also engage in reasonable limited consulting activities, all subject to his obtaining prior approval from the Board. GAMZU will be based at the Corporation’s corporate headquarters, which is currently located at Iselin, New Jersey and will spend a significant portion of his time in the Corporation’s offices in Rehovot, Israel.

Compensation.  
  
(a)  Base Salary. The Corporation shall pay GAMZU a base salary, beginning on the first day of the Term and ending on the last day of the Term, of $300,000 per annum, payable semi-monthly on the Corporation’s regular pay cycle for professional employees. The Board, in accordance with its customary review of executive management compensation, may from time to time review GAMZU’s base salary and make adjustments the Board (or its Compensation Committee) feels are appropriate, but in any event GAMZU’s base salary shall not be lower than $300,000.

* * *

  


(b)

Other and Additional Compensation.   
  
(i) Annual Bonus. During the Term, GAMZU shall receive an annual bonus of up to 25% of his base salary, based upon the attainment of agreed upon business, transactional, clinical and stock performance goals and milestones as determined by the Board (and its Compensation Committee). 

(ii) Stock Options. On the Commencement Date, the Board granted GAMZU options for the purchase of up to 150,000 shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock under the Corporation’s 2000 Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (“Plan”) at an exercise price of $1.55 per share, which represented the closing stock price of the Corporation’s Common Stock on the trading date immediately prior to the Commencement Date. The terms of the grant, including the vesting schedule, shall be as set forth in a separate option agreement executed by and between the parties. Additionally, on March 31, 2007, the date that he becomes CEO, GAMZU shall be granted options for the purchase of up to 200,000 shares under the Plan, at an exercise price equal to the closing stock price of the Corporation’s Common Stock on the trading date immediately prior to such date . This subsequent grant will be subject to the approval of the Corporation’s shareholders at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders of an increased number of authorized shares under the Plan. The initial grant of 150,000 options and the subsequent grant of 200,000 options are collectively referred to as the “Initial Option Grant.” The terms of the additional grant of 200,000 options, including the vesting schedule and exercise price, shall be as set forth in a separate option agreement executed by and between the parties and subject to the terms and conditions described in this Agreement. Subsequent stock option grants will be determined annually by the Board and the Compensation Committee.

(c) Additional Compensation. The foregoing establishes the minimum compensation during the Term and shall not preclude the Board from awarding GAMZU a higher salary or any additional bonuses or stock options in the event of a successful financing, strategic transaction, clinical development or otherwise, and in any event, in the discretion of the Board. 

4.

During the Term, GAMZU shall be entitled to the employee benefits generally made available to the Corporation’s executive officers, including four-weeks paid vacation and all Jewish and U.S. national holidays, participation in the Corporation’s 401(k) plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan (or other plans that may be made available from time to time to the Corporation’s executive officers), and current health and/or dental insurance benefits made available by the Corporation to its employees.

(b) Other Benefits. During the Term, the Company will pay for a furnished apartment in Israel of up to $1,500 per month.

As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Corporation shall arrange for and maintain short-term and long-term disability policies for the benefit of GAMZU in such amounts generally customary for similarly situated executive employees in the industry. GAMZU shall be reimbursed for all telephone expenses, including the costs of obtaining and maintaining separate telephone lines, incurred in furtherance of the business of the Corporation based upon the submission of appropriate documentation.

Termination.  
  
(a)  General. The Term shall end immediately upon GAMZU’s death, or upon termination for Cause, Disability or Good Reason, each as defined in Section 7. Upon termination of the Term due to GAMZU’s death, all compensation due GAMZU under this Agreement will cease. In all other cases, (i) the Corporation may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior written notice, and (ii) GAMZU may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice. The parties agree that the mere act of providing notice to the other party of termination shall not in any event be deemed to provide such other party the right to immediately terminate this Agreement.

(b)  Notice of Termination - Generally. Any termination by the Corporation of GAMZU’s employment hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to GAMZU at the address set forth herein or at such address kept in the records of the Corporation and shall specify the reasons for such termination. 

(c) Termination by the Corporation for Cause. Any written notice of termination by the Corporation of GAMZU for Cause shall, to the extent determined by the Board that the Cause is curable, allow GAMZU the opportunity to cure, but in any event no more than ten (10) days. Such notice of termination shall also state in reasonable detail the Board’s understanding of the facts leading to the determination of Cause. Upon the Corporation’s final termination of the Term for Cause, all compensation due to GAMZU under this Agreement will cease. Moreover, any unexercised portions of any stock option grants to GAMZU by the Corporation shall expire upon such termination.

(d) Termination by the Corporation upon a Change of Control. In the event that the Corporation terminates its relationship with GAMZU within three (3) months prior to or one (1) year following a “Change of Control”, as defined in Section 7(c), other than for Cause, GAMZU shall receive the following:

(i) an amount equal to twelve (12) months of then-current base salary (which is in addition to the base salary paid to GAMZU after the Corporation’s delivery of notice of termination pursuant to Section 6(a) and the actual date of termination); and

(ii) the full vesting of any and all stock options granted to GAMZU by the Corporation prior to such termination, and extended exercisability thereof until their respective expiration dates; and 

(iii)

Other Compensation (as defined in Section 9); and  
  
(iv) If the foregoing payments and benefits provided to GAMZU in Sections  
6(d)(i) through (iii) above (the “Change of Control Payments”) are or become subject to the tax (“Excise Tax”) imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Corporation shall pay to GAMZU such amount (the “Gross-up Payment”) as may be necessary to place GAMZU in the same after-tax position as if no portion of the Change of Control Payments and any amounts paid to him pursuant to this paragraph 6(d) had been subject to the Excise Tax.

For the avoidance of doubt, GAMZU shall be entitled to the foregoing benefits once notice of termination is given by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 6(d), regardless of his subsequent Death or Disability.
