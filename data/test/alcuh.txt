ARTICLE V 

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS 

The Employee also shall be awarded, at no additional cost, “Dividend Equivalents” based on the dividends declared on record dates during (and only during) the vesting period specified in Section 3.1 hereof, or during any shorter vesting period pursuant to section 3.4 hereof. Dividend equivalents shall be paid in the form of Common Stock and shall be paid only in the event and to the extent that the Employee exercises the Option. The number of Dividend Equivalent shares to be paid to the Employee upon exercise of the Option shall be computed as follows: 

(a) As of each dividend record date during the vesting period, the dividend which would be payable with respect to the sum of (i) the number of shares with respect to which the Option is then unexercised, and (ii) the number of Dividend Equivalent shares calculated for all previous periods but not issued prior to the dividend record date shall be computed. The number of Dividend Equivalent shares to be accrued as of the dividend record date shall then be determined by dividing the dividend which would be payable as of such record date on the number of shares determined by adding items (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of such record date. 

(b) The total number of Dividend Equivalent shares potentially available to the Employee upon any exercise of the Option shall be equal to the difference between (i) the total number of Dividend Equivalent shares earned by the Employee for all dividend record dates prior to the date of such exercise (as determined pursuant to paragraph (a) above and (ii) the total number of Dividend Equivalent shares previously paid to the Employee in connection with any prior exercise(s) of the Option. 

(c) The number of Dividend Equivalent shares to be paid to the Employee upon any exercise of the option shall be equal to the total number of Dividend Equivalent shares potentially available to the Employee upon such exercise (as determined pursuant to paragraph (b) above) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares with respect to which the Option is then being exercised and the denominator of which is the number of shares with respect to which the Option was unexercised immediately prior to said exercise. 

\- 12 - 

* * *

(d) Dividend Equivalents shall be paid only in the form of whole shares of Common Stock. No fractional shares shall be issued upon payment of Dividend Equivalents, but a cash payment shall be made by the Company in lieu of fractional shares.
