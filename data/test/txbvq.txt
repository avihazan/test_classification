PLURES TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

  


  


THIS WARRANT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL (i) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) SHALL HAVE BECOME EFFECTIVE WITH RESPECT THERETO OR (ii) RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PROPOSED TRANSFER NOR IS SUCH TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS LEGEND SHALL BE ENDORSED UPON ANY WARRANT ISSUED IN EX­CHANGE FOR THIS WARRANT.

  


Warrant to Purchase ___________ Shares

of Common Stock

  


This is to certify that _______________________ or assigns ("Holder"), is entitled to purchase, subject to the provisions of this Warrant, from Plures Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") up to Eighty Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Four (83,334) fully paid, validly issued, and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") prior to 5:00 p.m. local time on _____, 2017 (the "Termination Date") initially at an exercise price of Three and One-Half ($3.50) Dollars per share. The number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon the exercise of this Warrant (“Warrant Shares”) and the price to be paid for each share of Common Stock underlying this Warrant may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter set forth. The shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant, and as adjusted from time to time, are hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Warrant Shares" and the exercise price of a share of Common Stock in effect at any time and as adjusted from time to time is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Exercise Price."

1\.  EXERCISE OF WARRANT. This Warrant may be exercised after issuance as set forth herein and until the Termination Date; provided, however, that if such day is a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized by law to close, then on the next succeeding day which shall not be such a day. This Warrant may be exercised by presentation and surrender hereof to the Company at its principal office, or, at the Company's option, at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Purchase Form annexed hereto duly executed and accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares specified in such form. As soon as practicable after each such exercise of the Warrants, but not later than seven (7) days from the date of such exercise, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificate for the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee. If this Warrant should be exercised in part only, the Company shall, upon surrender of this Warrant for cancellation, execute and deliver a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder. Upon receipt by the Company of this Warrant at its office, or by the stock transfer agent of the Company at its office, in proper form for exercise, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Warrant Shares shall not then be physically delivered to the Holder.

* * *

  


2\.  RESERVATION OF SHARES. The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance and/or delivery upon exercise of this Warrant such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall be required for issuance and delivery upon exercise of the Warrants.

  


3. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. With respect to any fraction of a share called for upon any exercise hereof, the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash equal to such fraction, multiplied by the current Market Price.

  


4. EXCHANGE, TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT OR LOSS OF WARRANT. This Warrant is exchangeable and transferable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Company or, at the Company's option, at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, for other Warrants of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. Upon surrender of this Warrant to the Company at its principal office or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Assignment Form annexed hereto duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any transfer tax, the Company shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new Warrant in the name of the assignee named in such instrument of assignment and this Warrant shall promptly be canceled. This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants which carry the same rights upon presentation hereof at the principal office of the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued and signed by the Holder hereof. The term "Warrant" as used herein includes any Warrants into which this Warrant may be divided or exchanged. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, if mutilated, the Company will execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor and date. Any such new Warrant executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of the Company, whether or not this Warrant so lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

  


5. RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER. The Holder shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law or equity, and the rights of the Holder are limited to those expressed in the Warrant and are not enforceable against the Company except to the extent set forth herein.

6. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS. The Exercise Price in effect at any time and the number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events as follows:

  


(a) In case the Company shall (i) declare a dividend or make a distribution on its outstanding shares of Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price of this Warrant in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Holder of this Warrant exercised after such date, shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares which, if this Warrant had been exercised by such Holder immediately prior to such date, the Holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive upon such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification.

  


(b) In case of any consolidation with or merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or in case of any sale, lease or conveyance to another corporation of the assets of the Company as an entity or substantially as an entity, this Warrant shall after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance be exercisable for the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance) upon exercise of this Warrant would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of this Warrant shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable on the exercise of this Warrant.

  


(c) Whenever the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of this Warrant is adjusted pursuant to Subsections (a) and/or (b) above, the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall simultaneously be adjusted by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately before such adjustment by the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price as adjusted.

  


(d) No adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least Ten ($.10) Cents in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Subsection (d) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment required to be made hereunder. All calculations under this Section 6 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.

  


(e)  In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Subsection (b) above, the Holder of this Warrant thereafter shall become entitled to receive any shares other than Common Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock contained in Subsections (a) to (c), inclusive above.

  


9

* * *

(f) Irrespective of any adjustments in the Exercise Price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant, Warrant Certificates theretofore or thereafter issued upon exchange, transfer, assignment, loss of certificate or upon exercise in part may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as were stated in the Warrant Certificates when the same were originally issued.

  


7. OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE. Whenever the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as required by the provisions of Section 6, the Company shall forthwith file in the custody of its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary at its principal office and with the stock transfer agent responsible for this Warrant, if any, an officer's certificate showing the adjusted Exercise Price determined as herein provided, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment, including a statement of the number of additional shares of Common Stock, if any, and such other facts as shall be necessary to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment. Each such officer's certificate shall be made available at all reasonable times for inspection by the Holder or any holder of a Warrant and the Company shall, forthwith after each such adjustment, mail a copy by certified mail of such certificate to the Holder or any such holder.

  


8. NOTICES TO WARRANT HOLDERS. So long as this Warrant shall be outstanding, if an event described in Section 6(a) or (b) occurs, then in any such case, the Company shall cause to be mailed by certified mail to the Holder, at least ten days prior the date of the event specified in (a) or (b) below, as the case may be, a notice containing a brief description of the proposed event and stating the date on which (a) a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, or (b) such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of Common Stock or other securities shall receive cash or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. All notices, including under Section 11, shall be given in writing and shall be deemed given when received after being sent by recognized overnight carrier to the address of the Holder set forth on the records of the Company.

  


9. AMENDMENT; WAIVER OF PROVISIONS. This Warrant may not be amended, or compliance with any provision hereof waived, without the written consent of holders of the majority of the outstanding Warrants.

  


10. LEGEND. Unless the Warrant Shares are registered, under the Securities Act, the Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to a stop transfer order, and the certificate or certificates evidencing such Warrant Shares shall bear the following legend:

  


“THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL (i) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) SHALL HAVE BECOME EFFECTIVE WITH RESPECT THERETO OR (ii) RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PROPOSED TRANSFER NOR IS SUCH TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS LEGEND SHALL BE ENDORSED UPON ANY WARRANT ISSUED IN EX­CHANGE FOR THIS WARRANT."

* * *

11. ACCELERATION OF TERMINATION OF WARRANT. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect ten (10) business days after the giving of a Termination Notice (as hereinafter defined) to the Holder, as to which time is of the essence. The Company may give a notice to terminate this Warrant (“Termination Notice”) if there is trading of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange, and if not listed thereon, on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board market, at least at $6.00 (“Trigger Price”) per share for at least twenty (20) consecutive trading days, provided that the Trigger Price shall be subject to the same types of adjustment as the Exercise Price set forth in Sections 6(a) and (b) hereof.
