The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nola contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

  


SECTION 2. ACTION BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION \- The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed judicial action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an Agent against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses that such court shall deem proper.

  


SECTION 3. DETERMINATION OFRIGHTOFINDEMNIFICATION \- Any indemnification under Section 1 or 2of this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) if such a quorum is not 

  


  


* * *

  


obtainable or even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by the stockholders, that such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

  


SECTION4. INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST EXPENSES OF SUCCESSFUL PARTY \- Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article VII, to the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability, in defense of any proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such agent shall be indemnified against all expenses incurred in connection therewith.

  


SECTION 5. ADVANCES OF EXPENSES – Except as limited by Section 6 of this Article VII, expenses incurred in any action, suit, proceeding or investigation shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter if the Agent shall undertake to repay such amount in the event that it is ultimately determined, as provided herein, that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the Board of Directors or counsel at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such person deliberately breached his or her duty to the Corporation or its stockholders.

  


SECTION 6. RIGHT OF AGENT TO INDEMNIFICATION UPON APPLICATION; PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION – Any indemnification or advance under this Article VII shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety days, upon the written request of the Agent, unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors that such Agent acted in a manner set forth in this Article VII as to justify the Corporation's not indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. In the event no quorum of disinterested directors is obtainable, the Board of Directors shall promptly direct that independent legal counsel decide whether the Agent acted in the manner set forth in this Article VII as to justify the Corporation's not indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. The right to indemnification or advances granted by this Article VII shall be enforceable by the Agent in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no disposition of such claim is made within ninety days. The Agent's expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

  


SECTION 7. OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES – The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Agent seeking indemnification may be entitled under these Bylaws, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such Agent's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification under this Article shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Corporation and the Agent who serves in such capacity at 

  


  


* * *

  


any time while these Bylaws and other relevant provisions of the general corporation law and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any repeal or modification hereof or thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing. The execution of any other written contract for indemnification between the Agent and the Company shall in no way limit the rights of the Agent under this Article.

  


SECTION 8. INSURANCE – The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent against any liability asserted against such Agent and incurred by such Agent in any such capacity, or arising out of such Agent's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such Agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.

  


SECTION 9. CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS – For the purposes of this Article VII, references to "the Corporation" include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
