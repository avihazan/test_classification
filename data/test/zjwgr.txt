Pursuant to the Plan, the Administering Body approved the issuance to the Optionee, effective as of the date set forth above, of a Non-qualified Stock Option to purchase up to an aggregate of __________ shares of common stock of the Corporation (the “Common Stock”), at the price of $1.00 per share (the “Option Price”) which represents not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock determined in accordance with the Plan, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and undertakings hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

(iii)

5.

Procedure for Exercise.

  


(a)

Subject to the requirements of Section 8, the Option may be exercised, from time to time, in whole or in part (but for the purchase of a whole number of shares only), by delivery of a written notice, a form of which has been attached as Annex A hereto (the “Notice”), from the Optionee to the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation, which Notice shall:

(iv)

include any representations of the Optionee required under Section 8(c); and

  


(v)

if the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 9 by any person other than the Optionee, include evidence to the satisfaction of the Administering Body of the right of such person to exercise the Option.

  


(b)

Payment of the Option Price for the Optioned Shares shall be made in U.S. dollars by personal check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or by wire transfer.

  


(c)

6.

No Rights as a Stockholder. The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to any Optioned Shares until the date the Optionee or his nominee (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall include any third party agent selected by the Administering Body to hold such Optioned Shares on behalf of the Optionee), guardian or legal representative is the holder of record of such Optioned Shares.

  


7.

Adjustments.

  


(a)

If at any time while the Option is outstanding, (1) there shall be any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock through the declaration of a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or through any recapitalization resulting in a stock split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares of Common Stock or (2) the value of the outstanding shares of Common Stock is reduced by reason of an extraordinary cash dividend, then, and in each such event, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the number of shares and the exercise price per share covered by the Option, so that the same proportion of the Corporation’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall remain subject to purchase at the same aggregate exercise price.

(c)

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the existence of the Option shall not affect in any manner the right or power of the Corporation to make, authorize or consummate (i) any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Corporation’s capital structure or its business; (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation; (iii) any issue by the Corporation of debt securities, or preferred or preference stock that would rank above the shares of Common Stock covered by the Option; (iv) the dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation; (v) any sale, transfer or assignment of all or any part of the assets or business of the Corporation; or (vi) any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

  


8.
