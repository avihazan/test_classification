1. Employment.

(a) Services. The Executive will be employed by the Company and shall serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and shall perform, subject to the direction of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, such services and duties as are customarily performed by the Chief Financial Officer (the “Services”). The Executive shall also have such other powers and duties as may be from time to time prescribed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), provided that the nature of the Executive’s powers and duties so prescribed shall not be inconsistent with the Executive’s position and duties hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Agreement governing protection of the Company’s Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined in Section 5(a) hereof) shall continue in effect as specified in Section 5 hereof and survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be renewed for one or more additional one year periods (each, an “Additional Term” and, together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) if the Company and the Executive agree in writing on the terms of such renewal not less than 30 days prior to the end of the then current Term. If the Company and the Executive have not agreed on the terms of such renewal prior to such date, this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the then current term (a “Non-Renewal Event”).

* * *

3. Best Efforts; Place of Performance.

(a) During the Term, the Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention and energies to the business and affairs of the Company and shall use his best efforts to advance the best interests of the Company and shall not during the Term be actively engaged in any other business activity, whether or not such business activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with the prior written consent of the Company, Executive may serve as a member of boards of directors of other organizations not affiliated with the Company; provided, however, that the business or activities of any organization on which Executive proposes to serve as a director shall not compete with, or be likely to compete with, the Company’s Business (as defined in Section 6(a) below) and such service by Executive shall not interfere, or be likely to interfere, with the performance by Executive of the Services to be performed hereunder.

(b) The duties to be performed by the Executive hereunder shall be performed primarily at the principal office of the Company in South San Francisco, California, subject to reasonable travel requirements on behalf of the Company, or such other place as the Board may reasonably designate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive acknowledges that the Company may be relocated to another location within the San Francisco Bay Area. 

4. Compensation. As full compensation for the performance by the Executive of his duties under this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as follows:

(a) Base Salary. During the Term, the Company shall pay the Executive an annual base salary (the “Base Salary”), which shall initially be equal to $175,000 per year. The Base Salary shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices. The Base Salary will be reviewed by the Board no less frequently than annually and may be increased (but not decreased).

(b) Discretionary Bonus. At the sole discretion of the Board, the Executive may receive an additional annual bonus (the “Discretionary Bonus”) in an targeted at 30% of his then current Base Salary, based upon his performance on behalf of the Company during the prior year. The Discretionary Bonus shall be payable either as a lump-sum payment or installments as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. In addition, the Board shall annually review the Discretionary Bonus to determine whether an increase in the amount thereof is warranted.

(c) Withholding. The Company shall withhold all applicable federal, state and local taxes and social security and such other amounts as may be required by law from all amounts payable to the Executive under this Section 4.

(d) Expenses. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all normal, usual and necessary expenses incurred by the Executive in furtherance of the business and affairs of the Company, including reasonable travel and entertainment, upon timely receipt by the Company of appropriate vouchers or other proof of the Executive’s expenditures and otherwise in accordance with any expense reimbursement policy as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.

The Executive shall be entitled to all rights and benefits for which he shall be eligible under any benefit or other plans (including, without limitation, dental, medical, medical reimbursement and hospital plans, pension plans, employee stock purchase plans, profit sharing plans, bonus plans and other so-called “fringe” benefits) as the Company shall make available to its senior executives from time to time.

(f) Vacation. The Executive shall, during the Term, be entitled to vacation of three non-consecutive weeks per annum, in addition to public holidays observed by the Company. The Executive shall not be entitled to carry any vacation forward to the next year of employment.

In connection with the foregoing, the Executive will be covered under any liability insurance policy that protects other officers of the Company.

5. Confidential Information and Inventions.

(a) The Executive recognizes and acknowledges that in the course of his duties he is likely to receive confidential or proprietary information owned by the Company, its affiliates or third parties with whom the Company or any such affiliates has an obligation of confidentiality. Accordingly, during and after the Term, the Executive agrees to keep confidential and not disclose or make accessible to any other Person (as defined in Section 6(a) below) or use for any purpose other than in connection with the fulfillment of his duties under this Agreement, any Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined below) owned by or received by the Company or any of its affiliates. “Confidential and Proprietary Information” shall include, but shall not be limited to, confidential or proprietary scientific or technical information, data, formulas and related concepts, business plans (both current and under development), client lists, promotion and marketing programs, trade secrets, or any other confidential or proprietary business information relating to development programs, costs, revenues, marketing, investments, sales activities, promotions, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes, financing methods, plans or the business and affairs of the Company or of any affiliate or client of the Company. The Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Confidential and Proprietary Information and that the Confidential and Proprietary Information constitutes a protectable business interest of the Company. The Executive agrees (i) not to use any such Confidential and Proprietary Information for himself or others and (ii) not to take any Company material or reproductions (including but not limited to writings, correspondence, notes, drafts, records, invoices, technical and business policies, computer programs or disks) thereof from the Company’s offices at any time during his employment by the Company, except as required in the execution of the Executive’s duties to the Company. The Executive agrees to return immediately all Company material and reproductions (including but not limited, to writings, correspondence, notes, drafts, records, invoices, technical and business policies, computer programs or disks) thereof in his possession to the Company upon request and in any event immediately upon termination of employment.

* * *

(b) Except with prior written authorization by the Company, the Executive agrees not to disclose or publish any of the Confidential and Proprietary Information, or any confidential, scientific, technical or business information of any other party to whom the Company or any of its affiliates owes an obligation of confidence, at any time during or after his employment with the Company.

(c) The Executive agrees that all inventions, discoveries, improvements and patentable or copyrightable works (“Inventions”) initiated, conceived or made by him, either alone or in conjunction with others, during the Term shall be the sole property of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be “works made for hire” as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.A., Section 101). The Company shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property or other rights in connection therewith. The Executive hereby assigns to the Company all right, title and interest he may have or acquire in all such Inventions; provided, however, that the Chief Executive Officer may in his or her sole discretion agree to waive the Company’s rights pursuant to this Section 5(c) with respect to any Invention that is not directly or indirectly related to the Business (as defined in Section 6(a) below). The Executive further agrees to assist the Company in every proper way (but at the Company’s expense) to obtain and from time to time enforce patents, copyrights or other rights on such Inventions in any and all countries, and to that end the Executive will execute all documents necessary:

(i) To apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and

(ii) To defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection.

(d) The Executive acknowledges that while performing the services under this Agreement the Executive may locate, identify and/or evaluate patented or patentable inventions having commercial potential in the fields of pharmacy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, healthcare, technology and other fields which may be of potential interest to the Company or one of its affiliates (the “Third Party Inventions”). The Executive understands, acknowledges and agrees that all rights to, interests in or opportunities regarding all Third-Party Inventions identified by the Company, any of its affiliates or the officers, directors, employees (including the Executive), agents or consultants of either of the foregoing during the Employment Term shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company or such affiliate and the Executive shall have no rights whatsoever to such Third-Party Inventions and will not pursue for himself or for others any transaction relating to the Third-Party Inventions which is not on behalf of the Company.

* * *

(e) Executive agrees that he will promptly disclose to the Company, or to any designee of the Company, all improvements, Inventions made or conceived or reduced to practice or learned by Executive, either alone or jointly with others, during the Term.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

6. Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement.

(a) The Executive understands and recognizes that his services to the Company are special and unique and that in the course of performing such services the Executive will have access to and knowledge of Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined in Section 5) and the Executive agrees that, during the Term and for a period of 12 months thereafter, he shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any person, firm, partnership, joint venture, corporation or other business entity (“Person”), enter into or engage in any business which is engaged in any activities directly or indirectly competitive with the Company in the Business (as defined below) (each, a “Restricted Activity”) within the geographic area of the Company’s Business, which is deemed by the parties hereto to be worldwide. The Executive acknowledges that, due to the unique nature of the Business, the loss of any of the Company’s clients or business flow or the improper use of its Confidential and Proprietary Information may create significant instability and cause substantial damage to the Company and its affiliates. Therefore, the Company has a strong legitimate business interest in protecting the continuity of its business interests and the restriction herein agreed to by the Executive narrowly and fairly serves such an important and critical business interest of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Business” means the development and commercialization of drugs and other biomedical technologies in which the Company is actively engaged (1) for the treatment, detection or prevention of cancer and (2) for the treatment, detection or prevention of any other diseases, disorders, and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6(a) shall be deemed to prohibit the Executive from (i) engaging in a Restricted Activity for or with respect to any subsidiary, division or affiliate or unit (each, a “Unit”) of a Person if that Unit is not engaged in any business which is competitive with the Business of the Company, irrespective of whether some other Unit of such Person engages in such competition (as long as the Executive does not engage in a Restricted Activity for such other Unit), or (ii) acquiring or holding, solely for investment, publicly traded securities of any corporation, some or all of the activities of which are competitive with the Business of the Company so long as such securities do not, in the aggregate, constitute more than 4% of any class or series of outstanding securities of such corporation.

(b) During the Term and for a period of 12 months thereafter, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company:

(i) Solicit or induce any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or any such affiliate; hire for any purpose any employee of the Company; hire for any purpose any former employee of the Company or any affiliate of the Company who left the employment of the Company or any affiliate within the preceding twelve month period; or hire any former employee of the Company or any affiliate of the Company at any time if such hiring would cause a violation of such former employee’s non-competition agreement with the Company or any affiliate of the Company;

5

* * *

(ii) Solicit or accept employment or be retained by any Person who, at any time during the term of this Agreement, was an agent, client or customer of the Company or any of its affiliates where his position will be related to the Business of the Company or the business of any affiliate of the Company; or

(iii) Solicit or accept the business of any agent, client or customer of the Company or any of its affiliates with respect to products, services or investments similar to those provided or supplied by the Company or any of its affiliates.

(c) The Company and the Executive each agree that both prior to and during the Term and at all times thereafter, neither party shall willfully or intentionally, directly or indirectly disparage, whether or not true, the name or reputation of the other party or any of the Company’s affiliates, including but not limited to, any officer, director, employee or shareholder of the Company or any of its affiliates.

(d) The Executive hereby acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of any of the terms of Section 5 or 6 of hereof will result in substantial, continuing and irreparable injury to the Company. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to the Company, the Company will be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, without posting of a bond, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the terms of Section 5 or 6 hereof. The Company and the Executive agree that any such action for injunctive or equitable relief shall be heard in a state or federal court located in the State of California and each of the parties hereto agrees to accept service of process by registered or certified mail and to otherwise consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.

(e) The rights and remedies of the Company enumerated in Section 6(d) shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights and remedies available to the Company at law or in equity. If any of the covenants contained in this Section 6, or any part of any of them, is hereafter construed or adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants or rights or remedies which shall be given full effect without regard to the invalid portions. If any of the covenants contained in this Section 6 is held to be invalid or unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision and in its reduced form such provision shall then be enforceable. No such holding of invalidity or unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall bar or in any way affect the Company’s right to the relief provided in this Section 6 or otherwise in the courts of any other state or jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective states or jurisdictions, such covenants being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.

* * *

(f) In the event that an actual proceeding is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of Section 5 or this Section 6, the Executive shall not urge as a defense that there is an adequate remedy at law nor shall the Company be prevented from seeking any other remedies which may be available. 

(g) The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

7. Representations and Warranties.

(a) The Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

(i) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the performance by the Executive of his duties and other obligations hereunder violate or will violate any statute, law, determination or award, or conflict with or constitute a default or breach of any covenant or obligation under (whether immediately, upon the giving of notice or lapse of time or both) any prior employment agreement, contract, or other instrument to which the Executive is a party or by which he is bound; and

(ii) The Executive has the full right, power and legal capacity to enter and deliver this Agreement and to perform his duties and other obligations hereunder.

7

(b) The Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated by the Chief Executive Officer as a result of the Executive’s Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, a termination for “Disability” shall occur (i) when the Chief Executive Officer has provided a written termination notice to the Executive supported by a written statement from a reputable independent physician to the effect that the Executive has become so physically or mentally incapacitated as to be unable to resume, within the ensuing 6 months, his employment hereunder by reason of physical or mental illness or injury, or (ii) upon delivery of a written termination notice to the Executive by the Chief Executive Officer after the Executive has been unable to substantially perform his duties hereunder for 60 or more consecutive days, or more than 90 days in any 12 month period, by reason of any physical or mental illness or injury.
