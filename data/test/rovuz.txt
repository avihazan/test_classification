Exhibit 10.30 

FORM OF 



PURSUANT TO THE NN, INC. 

2011 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 

This Restricted Stock Grant Agreement (“Agreement”) is made as of by NN, Inc. (the “Company”) and (“Grantee”) to effect an award of restricted stock by Company to Grantee on the terms and conditions set forth below: 

1\. Award of Restricted Stock. As of the above-entered date, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein, the Company grants and issues to Grantee 5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Granted Stock”). 

2\. Governing Plan. The Granted Stock shall be granted pursuant to and (except as specifically set forth herein) subject in all respects to the applicable provisions of the NN, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (“Plan”), which are incorporated herein by reference. Terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.

3\. Restrictions on the Granted Stock. 

(a) No Transfer. The shares of Granted Stock (including any shares received by Grantee with respect to shares of Granted Stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization or a similar transaction affecting the Company’s securities without receipt of consideration) may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered during the Restricted Period. 

(b) Vesting. The restrictions imposed under Section 3(a) will be removed from the Granted Stock as set forth on the Vesting Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit “A”. Removal of the restrictions imposed under Section 3(a) from particular shares of Granted Stock is referred to as “vesting” of those shares and shares from which the restrictions have been removed are referred to as “vested.” 

4\. Voting and Other Rights. During the period prior to vesting, except as otherwise provided herein, Grantee will have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to all of the Granted Stock, including without limitation the right to vote such Granted Stock and the right to receive all dividends or other distributions with respect to such Granted Stock. In connection with the payment of such dividends or other distributions, the Company will be entitled to deduct from any amounts otherwise payable by the Company to Grantee (including without limitation salary or other compensation) any taxes or other amounts required by any governmental authority to be withheld and paid over to such authority for Grantee’s account.

* * *

5\. Certification, Escrow and Delivery of Shares. 

(a) Certificates. Each certificate representing any unvested portion of the Granted Stock will be endorsed with a legend substantially as set forth below, as well as such other legends as the Company may deem appropriate to comply with applicable laws and regulations: 

The securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to certain limitations on transfer and other restrictions as set forth in that certain Restricted Stock Agreement, dated as of , between the Company and the holder of such securities, pursuant to the NN, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (copies of which are available for inspection at the offices of the Company). 

(b) Escrow. With respect to each unvested share of Granted Stock (including any shares received by Grantee with respect to shares of Granted Stock that have not yet vested as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization or a similar transaction affecting the Company’s securities without receipt of consideration), the Secretary of the Company, or such other escrow holder as the Secretary may appoint, will retain physical custody of the certificate representing such share until such share vests. 

(c) Delivery of Certificates. As soon as reasonably practicable after the vesting of any Granted Stock, the Company will release the certificate(s) representing such vested Granted Stock to Grantee. If other still unvested shares of Granted Stock are also represented by the same stock certificate as vested shares, then such certificate will be retired and new certificates representing the vested and unvested portions of the Granted Stock will be issued in place of the existing certificate. The certificate representing the vested Granted Stock will be delivered to Grantee and the certificate representing the still unvested shares of Granted Stock will be retained by the escrow holder. 

6\. Additional Agreements. 

(a) Tax Matters. The Granted Stock is subject to appropriate income tax withholding and other deductions required by applicable laws or regulations, and Grantee and his successors will be responsible for all income and other taxes payable as a result of grant or vesting of the Granted Stock or otherwise in connection with this Agreement. The Company is not required to provide any gross-up or other tax assistance. Grantee understands that Grantee may make an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) within thirty (30) days after the date Grantee acquired the Granted Stock hereunder, or comparable provisions of any state tax law, to include in Grantee’s gross income the fair market value (as of the date of acquisition) of the Granted Stock. Grantee may make such an election only if, prior to making any such election, Grantee (a) notifies the Company of Grantee’s intention to make such election, by delivering to the Company a copy of the fully-executed Section 83(b) Election Form attached hereto as Exhibit “B”, and (b) pays to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any taxes or other amounts required by any governmental authority to be withheld or paid over to such authority for Grantee’s account, or otherwise makes arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of such amounts through withholding or otherwise. Grantee understands that if Grantee does not make a proper and timely Section 83(b) election, generally under Section 83 of the Code, at the time the forfeiture 

* * *

restrictions applicable to the Granted Stock lapse, Grantee will recognize ordinary income and be taxed in an amount equal to the fair market value (as of the date the forfeiture restrictions lapse) of the Granted Stock less the Acquisition Consideration paid for the Granted Stock. Grantee acknowledges that it is Grantee’s sole responsibility, and not the Company’s, to file a timely election under Section 83(b), even if Grantee requests the Company or its representative to make this filing on Grantee’s behalf. Grantee is relying solely on Grantee’s advisors with respect to the decision as to whether or not to file a Section 83(b) election. 

(b) Independent Advice; No Representations. Grantee acknowledges that (i) (s)he was free to use professional advisors of his choice in connection with this Agreement, has received advice from her/his professional advisors in connection with this Agreement, understands its meaning and import, and is entering into this Agreement freely and without coercion or duress; and (ii) (s)he has not received and is not relying upon any advice, representations or assurances made by or on behalf of the Company or any Company affiliate or any employee of or counsel to the Company regarding any tax or other effects or implications of the Granted Stock or other matters contemplated by this Agreement. 

(c) Value of Granted Stock. No representations or promises are made to Grantee regarding the value of the Granted Stock or Company’s business prospects. Grantee acknowledges that information about investment in Company stock, including financial information and related risks, is contained in Company’s SEC reports which have been made available for Grantee’s review at any time before Grantee’s acceptance of this Agreement. Further, Grantee understands that the Company does not provide tax or investment advice and acknowledges Company’s recommendation that Grantee consult with independent specialists regarding such matters. Sale or other transfer of the Company stock may be limited by and subject to Company policies as well as applicable securities laws and regulations. 

(d) Adjustment in Capitalization. In the event of an Adjustment Event that is a merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction, then the Award pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement shall be deemed to pertain to the securities and other property, including cash, to which a holder of the number of shares equal to the Granted Stock would have been entitled to receive in connection with such Adjustment Event; provided, that any securities issued to Grantee in respect of unvested Granted Shares will be subject to the same restrictions and vesting provisions that were applicable to the Granted Stock for which they were issued. 

(e) Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control, vesting shall occur, if at all, with respect to the Granted Stock in accordance with Section 11 of the Plan. 

(f) Termination of Employment. If the Grantee’s service with the Company terminates for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, any unvested Granted Stock shall be forfeited. 

* * *

If the Grantee’s service with the Company terminates because of the Grantee’s Disability or death, the Granted Stock shall be immediately vested. 

If the Grantee’s service with the Company terminates because of the Grantee’s Retirement, the Granted Stock shall be immediately vested. “Retirement” means termination of service after the Grantee has completed 10 years of service with the Company and has reached the age of 55. 

(g) No Right to Continued Employment. This Agreement does not confer upon Grantee any right to continue as an employee of the Company or its affiliate or to any particular employment tenure, nor does it limit in any way the right of Company or its affiliate to terminate Grantee’s services to the Company or its affiliate at any time, with or without cause. 

7\. General. 

(a) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is personal in its nature and Grantee may not assign or transfer his/her rights under this Agreement.
