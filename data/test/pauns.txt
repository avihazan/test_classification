2.1 Generally. All of the Restricted Shares shall initially be unvested, and shall vest with respect to one-third of the total Restricted Shares on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date (provided that the Recipient is employed by or in the service of the Company on the applicable vesting date). For purposes of this Agreement, the Recipient is considered to be employed by or in the service of the Company if the Recipient is employed by or in the service of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company (an “Employer”).

  


2.2 Acceleration Upon Death or Disability. If the Recipient ceases to be employed by or in the service of the Company as a result of death or physical disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), all of the Restricted Shares shall immediately vest.

  


2.3 Double Trigger Acceleration in Connection with a Change in Control. All of the Restricted Shares shall immediately vest if a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs and at any time after the Change in Control and on or before the second anniversary of the Change in Control, (i) the Recipient’s employment or service is terminated by the Company (or its successor) without Cause (as defined below), or (ii) the Recipient’s employment or service is terminated by the Recipient for Good Reason (as defined below). In addition, all of the Restricted Shares shall vest immediately prior to the consummation of a Change in Control if (a) the Recipient’s employment or service is terminated by the Company without Cause or the Recipient’s employment or service is terminated by the Recipient for Good Reason after Shareholder Approval (as defined below) but before the Change in Control and (b) the Change in Control occurs within one year following the Recipient’s termination of employment or service.

(a) At any time during a period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors of the Company (“Incumbent Directors”) shall cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; provided, however, that the term “Incumbent Director” shall also include each new director elected during such two-year period whose nomination or election was approved by two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors then in office;

(b) At any time that the holders of the Class A Common Stock of the Company have the right to elect (voting as a separate class) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, any “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) shall, as a result of a tender or exchange offer, open market purchases or privately negotiated purchases from anyone other than the Company, have become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding Class A Common Stock of the Company;

No act, or failure to act, shall be considered “willful” if the Recipient reasonably believed that the action or omission was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company or the Employer.

  


2.3.4 For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean:

  


(a) the assignment of a different title, job or responsibilities that results in a decrease in the level of responsibility of the Recipient after Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control when compared to the Recipient’s level of responsibility for the Company’s or the Employer’s operations prior to Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control; provided that Good Reason shall not exist if the Recipient continues to have the same or a greater general level of responsibility for Company operations after the Change in Control as the Recipient had prior to the Change in Control even if the Company operations are a subsidiary or division of the surviving company, 

(b) a reduction in the Recipient’s base pay as in effect immediately prior to Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control, 

(c) a material reduction in total benefits available to the Recipient under cash incentive, stock incentive and other employee benefit plans after Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control compared to the total package of such benefits as in effect prior to Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control, or 

(d) the Recipient is required to be based more than 50 miles from where the Recipient’s office is located immediately prior to Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control except for required travel on company business to an extent substantially consistent with the business travel obligations which the Recipient undertook on behalf of the Company prior to Shareholder Approval, if applicable, or the Change in Control.

3\. Forfeiture Restriction. If the Recipient ceases to be employed by or in the service of the Company for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause, any Restricted Shares that did not vest pursuant to Section 2 above at or prior to the time of such termination of employment or service shall be forfeited to the Company; provided, however, that if the Recipient’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason after Shareholder Approval but before a Change in Control, any Restricted Shares will not be forfeited under this sentence unless a Change in Control does not subsequently occur within one year of such termination of employment or service. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be employed by the Company or any Employer or to continue to provide services to the Company or any Employer or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Employer to terminate Recipient’s services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.

  


4\. Restriction on Transfer. The Recipient shall not sell, assign, pledge, or in any manner transfer unvested Restricted Shares, or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the Recipient’s domicile at the time of death. Any sale or transfer, or purported sale or transfer, of unvested Restricted Shares, or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, in violation of this Section 4 shall be null and void.

5\. Tax Withholding. Recipient acknowledges that, on the date (the “Vesting Date”) any portion of the Restricted Shares vests, the Value (as defined below) on that date of such vested Restricted Shares will be treated as ordinary compensation income for federal and state income and FICA tax purposes, and that the Company will be required to withhold taxes on this income amount. To satisfy the required withholding amount, Recipient shall surrender to the Company the number of vested Restricted Shares having a Value equal to the required withholding amount, and the Company shall have the right to cancel such number of vested Restricted Shares without any further action by Recipient before delivering the balance of the vested Restricted Shares to Recipient in accordance with Section 7. For purposes of this Section 5, the “Value” of a Restricted Share shall be equal to the closing market price for Class B Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the Vesting Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may elect with respect to any Vesting Date to pay withholding taxes in cash instead of having vested Restricted Shares withheld to cover taxes by giving notice to the Company in writing at least 15 days prior to the Vesting Date, in which case no vested Restricted Shares shall be delivered to Recipient until Recipient shall have paid to the Company in cash any required tax withholding. Recipient agrees not to file with respect to any Restricted Shares any election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

  


6\. Rights as Shareholder; Dividends. Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the award of the Restricted Shares shall be completed and, except as limited by this Agreement, the Recipient shall be the owner of the Restricted Shares with all rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and to receive ordinary dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Shares from the date of this Agreement. Until the Restricted Shares become vested, they will not be treated as issued shares for federal income tax purposes and dividends paid to the Recipient with respect to the Restricted Shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as additional compensation subject to applicable withholding.

  


7\. Stock Certificate. To secure the rights of the Company under Sections 3 and 5, the Company will retain the certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Shares. Upon any forfeiture of the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to cancel the Restricted Shares in accordance with this Agreement without any further action by the Recipient. After Restricted Shares have vested and all required withholding has been paid to the Company in connection with such vesting, the Company shall deliver a certificate for the remaining vested Restricted Shares to the Recipient.

  


8\. Changes in Capital Structure. If, prior to vesting of Restricted Shares, the outstanding Class B Common Stock is increased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company or of another corporation as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange, recapitalization or reclassification, the restrictions and other provisions of this Agreement shall apply to any such additional shares of Class B Common Stock or other shares or securities which are issued in respect of the Restricted Shares to the same extent as such restrictions and other provisions apply to the Restricted Shares.
