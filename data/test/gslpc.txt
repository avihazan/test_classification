TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION

1.Vesting.  
  
1.1 Performance-Based and Time-Based Vesting. The Option is subject to both a time-based vesting requirement and a performance-based vesting requirement. The total number of shares subject to the Option (subject to adjustment under Section 7.1 of the Plan) is divided into two separate tranches as follows: one-half (1/2) of the total number of shares subject to the Option (rounded to the nearest whole share) will be eligible to vest with respect to a performance measurement period consisting of the Tranche 1 Performance Period (the “Tranche 1 Shares”); and one-half (1/2) of the total number of shares subject to the Option (rounded to the nearest whole share) will be eligible to vest with respect to a performance measurement period consisting of the Tranche 2 Performance Period (the “Tranche 2 Shares”). The “Tranche 1 Performance Period” means the three-year period consisting of the Corporation’s 2015, 2016 and 2017 fiscal years (ending on the Saturday closest to January 31 of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively). The “Tranche 2 Performance Period” means the two-year period consisting of the Corporation’s 2018 and 2019 fiscal years (ending on the Saturday closest to January 31 of 2019 and 2020, respectively).

(A) Vesting of the Tranche 1 Shares. The Tranche 1 Shares shall vest and become exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject to the Tranche 1 Shares on the last day of the Tranche 1 Performance Period, provided that (1) the closing price of the Corporation’s Common Stock (in regular trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other principal exchange on which the Corporation’s Common Stock is then listed or admitted to trade) equals or exceeds twenty dollars ($20.00) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7) for not less than sixty (60) trading days during a period of not less than ninety (90) consecutive trading days during the Tranche 1 Performance Period, and (2) the Grantee continues to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary through the last day of the Tranche 1 Performance Period. To the extent the Tranche 1 Shares do not become eligible to vest in accordance with this Section 1.1(A), such Tranche 1 Shares shall, subject to the Grantee’s continued employment by the Corporation or a Subsidiary through the last day of the Tranche 1 Performance Period, remain eligible to vest in accordance with Section 1.1(B) of this Option Agreement (such shares, the “Carryover Shares”).

(B) Vesting of the Tranche 2 Shares and Carryover Shares. The Tranche 2 Shares (and, if applicable, any Carryover Shares) shall vest and become exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject to the Tranche 2 Shares (and, if applicable, any Carryover Shares) on the last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period, provided that (1) the closing price of the Corporation’s Common Stock (in regular trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other principal exchange on which the Corporation’s Common Stock is then listed or admitted to trade) equals or exceeds twenty-five dollars ($25.00) (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7) for not less than sixty (60) trading days during a period of not less than ninety (90) consecutive trading days during the Tranche 2 Performance Period, and (2) the Grantee continues to be employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary through the last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period. For purposes of clarity, in no event shall the Tranche 2 Shares become eligible to vest during the Tranche 1 Performance Period.

1  
  
1.2 Effect of a Qualifying Change in Control. In the event a Qualifying Change in Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period and prior to a termination of the Grantee’s employment by or service to the Corporation or a Subsidiary for any reason, the total number of shares subject to the Option that are outstanding and unvested as of the date of such Qualifying Change in Control shall remain eligible to vest and become exercisable on the first to occur of the following events after such Qualifying Change in Control (regardless of whether the stock price goals of Section 1.1(A) or Section 1.1(B), as the case may be, are attained after the date of such event):

(i) The date the Grantee ceases to be employed by or ceases to provide services to the Corporation or a Subsidiary due to a termination of the Grantee’s employment by the Corporation or a Subsidiary without Cause (as defined below);

(ii) The date the Grantee ceases to be employed by or ceases to provide services to the Corporation or a Subsidiary due to a termination of employment by the Grantee for Good Reason (as defined below); and

(iii) The last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period, subject to the Grantee’s continuous employment by or service to the Corporation or a Subsidiary through the last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period.

1.3 Effect of a Change in Control that is Not a Qualifying Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the last day of the Tranche 2 Performance Period and such Change in Control does not constitute a Qualifying Change in Control for purposes of this Option Agreement, the shares subject to the Option shall terminate to the extent such shares have not become vested pursuant to Section 1 hereof prior to the Change in Control.

1.4 Termination at the End of the Tranche 2 Performance Period. The Tranche 2 Shares and, if applicable, any Carryover Shares, shall terminate as of the end of the Tranche 2 Performance Period to the extent such shares have not become vested pursuant to Section 1 hereof prior to such date.

1.5 Defined Terms. The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Option Agreement:

(i) “Cause” with respect to the Grantee means the definition of “Cause” provided in any written offer letter or similar written agreement between the Grantee and the Corporation or any Subsidiary.

(ii) “Change in Control” with respect to the Grantee means the definition of “Change in Control” provided in any written offer letter or similar written agreement between the Grantee and the Corporation or any Subsidiary. If the Grantee is not covered by such an agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary that defines such term, then “Change in Control” with respect to the Grantee has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Plan.

(iii) “Good Reason” with respect to the Grantee means the definition of “Good Reason” provided in any written offer letter or similar written agreement between the Grantee and Corporation or any Subsidiary. If the Grantee is not covered by such an agreement with the Corporation or a Subsidiary that defines such term, then “Good Reason” with respect to the Grantee means the occurrence (without the Grantee’s consent) of any one or more of the following conditions: (A) a material diminution by the Company in the Grantee’s rate of base salary; (B) a material diminution by the Company in the Grantee’s authority, duties, or responsibilities; (C) a material change in the geographic location of the Grantee’s principal office with the Corporation (for this purpose, in no event shall a relocation of such office to a new location that is not more than fifty (50) miles from the current location of the Corporation’s executive offices constitute a “material change”); or (D) a material breach by the Corporation of this Option Agreement; provided, however, that any such condition or conditions, as applicable, shall not constitute Good Reason unless both (x) the Grantee provides written notice to the Corporation of the condition claimed to constitute Good Reason within sixty (60) days of the initial existence of such condition(s) (such notice to be delivered in accordance with Section 8), and (y) the Corporation fails to remedy such condition(s) within thirty (30) days of receiving such written notice thereof; and provided, further, that in all events the termination of the Grantee’s employment with the Corporation shall not constitute a termination for Good Reason unless such termination occurs not more than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the initial existence of the condition claimed to constitute Good Reason.

(iii) “Qualifying Change in Control” means a Change in Control pursuant to which the value of a share of the Corporation’s Common Stock upon (or immediately prior to, as the case may be) such Change in Control is equal to or greater than One Hundred Forty Percent (140%) of the Exercise Price per share of the Option (after giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7).

(iv) “Severance Date” means the last day that the Grantee is employed by or provides services to the Corporation or a Subsidiary.

(v) “Total Disability” means a “permanent and total disability” (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or as otherwise determined by the Administrator).

2\. Limits on Exercise; Incentive Stock Option Status.

The Option may be exercised only to the extent the Option is vested and exercisable.

3\. Continuance of Employment/Service Required; No Employment/Service Commitment.

Except as expressly provided in Section 1 of this Option Agreement, the vesting schedule applicable to the Option requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not (except as expressly provided in Section 1) entitle the Grantee to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 5 below or under the Plan.

Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment or service commitment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, affects the Grantee’s status, if he is an employee, as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Grantee any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Grantee’s other compensation.

·any written statements or agreements required pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan; and
