3\. Terms and Conditions. 

(a) Vesting. Subject to the Participant’s continued service with the Company and its Affiliates on each applicable vesting date, the Option shall vest and thereby become exercisable with respect to one-third of the Option Shares on each of [ ] , 20[ ], [ ] , 20[ ] and [ ] , 20[]. 

(b) Option Price. The price at which the Participant shall be entitled to purchase the Option Shares upon the exercise of all or any portion of the Option shall be $[ ] per Option Share. 

(c) Expiration Date. Subject to Section 3(e) hereof, the Option shall expire at the end of the period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on [ ], 20[ ] (the “Option Period”). 

(d) Exercisability of the Option. 

(i) The Option may be exercised only by written notice, which notice shall either be delivered in person, by mail or by electronic means and shall be accompanied by payment therefor. The purchase price of the Option Shares shall be paid by the Participant to the Company (A) (1) in cash (by check or wire transfer) or (2) by means of a broker-assisted “cashless exercise” program; or (B) by such other method as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including without limitation: (1) by a “net exercise” method. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Participant be permitted to exercise the Option in a manner that the Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or any other applicable law or the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange or inter dealer quotation system on which the securities of the Company or any Affiliates are listed or traded. 

(e) Effect of Termination of Service on the Option. 

(i) Termination of Employment by Reason of Physical or Mental Disability, Retirement or Death. If the Participant’s employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminated during the Option Period by reason of the Participant’s physical or mental disability, death or retirement (the Committee having made a specific determination that such termination should be treated as retirement for purposes of the Plan) on or prior to the expiry date of the Option, while engaged as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Option may be exercised by the Participant (or if the Participant shall be disabled or deceased, the legal representative(s) of the Participant) at any time up to and including one year following such physical or mental disability, retirement or death for up to the full amount of the then vested Option Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant’s employment is terminated on account of a reason specified in this Section 3(e)(i), any Option Shares that remain unvested on the effective date of such termination that would vest on the next vesting date shall vest on that vesting date and any other unvested Option Shares shall immediately expire. The Option 

\- 2 -

##### 

shall expire and terminate at the earlier of (i) the end of such one year period from the effective date of termination or (ii) the end of the Term. For greater certainty, during the period that the Participant is deemed to be an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any medical or disability plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, such Participant shall also be deemed to be an employee for the purposes of the Plan, and the one year period of continued exercisability provided in this Section 3(e)(i) shall commence upon the termination of all actual and deemed employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided that any such period of deemed employment and any such period of continued exercisability shall terminate no later than the end of the Option Period. 

(ii) Other Termination of Employment. If the Participant’s employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall terminate during the Option Period for any reason other than those described in Section 3(e)(i), the Option (to the extent vested and exercisable on the date of such termination of employment) may be exercised at any time within ninety (90) days after such termination (but not beyond the expiration of the Option Period). The Option, to the extent not then vested and exercisable, shall immediately expire upon such termination of employment. For purposes of the grant hereunder, any transfer of employment by the Participant among the Company and any of its subsidiaries shall not be considered a termination of employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

(iii) Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, immediately prior to the occurrence of any Change in Control of the Company, the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable. The phrase “immediately prior to” in the immediately preceding sentence shall mean sufficiently in advance of the Change in Control to permit the Participant to take all steps reasonably necessary to exercise the Option fully and to deal with the Optioned Shares so that the Optioned Shares shall be treated in the same manner in connection with the Change in Control as the shares of stock of other shareholders. 

(f) Compliance with Legal Requirements. The granting and exercise of the Option, and any other obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may postpone the issuance or delivery of Option Shares as the Committee may consider appropriate and may require the Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Option Shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

(g) Transferability. The Option shall not be transferable by the Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise permitted by the Committee. 

(h) Rights as Stockholder. The Participant shall not be deemed for any purpose to be the owner of any shares of Common Stock subject to this Option unless,

until and to the extent that (i) this Option shall have been exercised pursuant to its terms, (ii) the Company shall have issued and delivered to the Participant the Option Shares, and (iii) the Participant’s name shall have been entered as a stockholder of record with respect to such Option Shares on the books of the Company. 

(i) Taxes. Unless the Committee permits or requires such withholding obligation to be satisfied by another method described in the Plan, the Participant shall be required to pay the Company, and the Company (or any Affiliate) shall have the right to withhold from any Option Shares to be delivered to the Participant, the amount of any federal, state or local withholding taxes required to be withheld, if any, upon the exercise of such Option. 

4\. Non-Competition / Confidentiality. As a condition to and in consideration of the grant of the Option by the Company, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged, the Participant agrees:
