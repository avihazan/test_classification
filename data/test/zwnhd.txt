(B) upon the consummation of a merger, consolidation, or similar business combination involving the Company, other than any such transaction which results in at least 75% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the surviving entity (or the parent entity thereof) outstanding immediately after such transaction being beneficially owned by at least 75% of the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the transaction with the voting power of each such continuing holder relative to other such continuing holders not being substantially altered in the transaction; or

(b) The Officer agrees to pay in a timely manner deemed suitable by the Company, and to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from, any and all taxes (including all penalties and interest, if any, thereon), resulting from the grant and/or transfer of the above-referenced Restricted Stock for which ultimate responsibility is assigned to or asserted against the Officer under applicable law. For purposes of this provision, all withholding obligations of the Company in respect of the aforementioned taxes (including any and all taxes, penalties and interest imposed on or asserted against the Company for failure to properly withhold and remit any such amounts in a timely manner) shall be considered the responsibility of the Officer and, accordingly, the Officer agrees to pay in a timely manner deemed suitable by the Company, and to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from, any and all of such obligations.
