Date Number of Shares Vested  
[ ] [ ]  
  
The foregoing notwithstanding, vesting pursuant to the foregoing schedule shall occur on a Vesting Date only if Participant remains employed by or provides services to the Corporation from the Date of Grant to such Vesting Date.

The certificate shall bear a legend evidencing the nature of the Restricted Stock, and the Corporation may cause the certificate to be delivered upon issuance to the Secretary of the Corporation or to such other depository as may be designated by the Corporation as a depository to be held in escrow for safekeeping until the Vesting Date or a forfeiture occurs pursuant to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement.

6\. Status of Stock.

8\. Tax Election.
