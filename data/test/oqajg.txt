(b) During Executive’s employment, Executive will be entitled to participate in the Company’s employee benefit plans to which other employees of the Company are generally entitled to participate; provided, however, Executive’s entitlement to participate in such benefit plans is subject to the eligibility requirements and other terms and conditions of such benefit plans. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company, in its sole discretion, may change, amend or discontinue any of its employee benefit plans or programs at any time during Executive’s employment with the Company, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate the Company to institute, maintain or refrain from changing, amending or discontinuing any benefit plan or program.

1.5. Employment Policies. Executive will abide by any employment or work rules and/or policies that the Company currently has or may adopt, amend or implement from time to time during Executive’s employment. 

1.6. Termination. Executive’s employment is on an at-will basis and this Agreement does not guarantee employment for any specific duration. Either the Company or Executive may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without advance notice. 

1.7. Severance Benefits. 

(a) Pay. If the Company terminates Executive’s employment, it shall pay Executive, as severance pay, an amount equivalent to twelve (12) months of Executive’s base salary, subject to normal payroll taxes and deductions. Payment will be made ratably over the twelve (12) month period immediately following the termination of Executive’s employment, consistent with the customary payroll practices of the Company. Provided, however, Executive will not be entitled to the severance discussed in this Section 1.7(a) if Executive voluntarily resigns his employment or if the Company terminates his employment for Cause.   
  
(b) Additional Insurance Stipend. If the Company terminates Executive’s employment, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum stipend equal to 167% of the product of twelve (12) times the monthly COBRA premium that corresponds, as of the date of Executive’s termination of employment, to the health, dental, and vision coverage that Executive had in effect under the Company’s health, dental and vision plans immediately prior to termination of employment. The stipend will be subject to all applicable withholdings and deductions, and will be paid to Executive on the same payroll date as the first installment of severance pay described above in Section 1.7(a). Executive may apply the stipend towards Executive’s purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for any other purpose. Provided, however, Executive will not be entitled to any payment from the Company as described in this Section 1.7(b) if Executive voluntarily resigns his employment or if the Company terminates his employment for Cause.   
  
Except for Executive’s rights under COBRA or as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the terms of any applicable benefit plan or applicable law, Executive’s eligibility to participate in, and/or his receipt of, all employee benefits and perquisites will terminate as of the date Executive’s employment terminates. 

(c) Outplacement Assistance. If the Company terminates Executive’s employment, the Company will provide Executive with outplacement services for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of termination to assist Executive in his search for new employment. Such outplacement services shall be consistent with those that the Company has provided to former employees. Provided, however, Executive will not be entitled to the outplacement benefits discussed in this Section 1.7(c) if Executive voluntarily resigns his employment or if the Company terminates his employment for Cause.

Payment will be made ratably over the twelve (12) month period immediately following the termination of Executive’s employment, consistent with the customary payroll practices of the Company. Provided, however, Executive will not be entitled to the severance discussed in this Section 1.7(d)(i) if Executive voluntarily resigns his employment or if the Company terminates his employment for Cause.

For the Executive to be entitled to severance benefits because of his resignation following the occurrence of one (1) of the listed events, each of the following procedural conditions must be satisfied: (i) within ninety (90) days of the initial occurrence of the event, the Executive must give written notice to the Company of such occurrence; (ii) the Company must have failed to remedy that occurrence within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, and (iii) the Executive must resign no later than 150 days after the initial occurrence of the event.

The stipend will be subject to all applicable withholdings and deductions, and will be paid to Executive on the same payroll date as the first installment of severance pay described above in this Section 1.7(d). Executive may apply the stipend towards Executive’s purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for any other purpose. Provided, however, Executive will not be entitled to any payment from the Company towards COBRA premiums as described in this Section 1.7(d)(iii) if Executive voluntarily resigns his employment (other than pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.7(d)(ii)) or if the Company terminates his employment for Cause.

(II) Dishonesty of Executive affecting the Company;

(VI) Any misconduct of Executive resulting in material loss to the Company, or material damage to the reputation of the Company, or theft or defalcation from the Company;   
  
(VII) Executive’s neglect or failure to substantially perform Executive’s material duties and responsibilities under this Agreement; or   
  
(VIII) Any material breach (not covered by any of clauses (I) through (VI) above) of any of the provisions of this Agreement.   
  
(ii) “Change in Control” of the Company means (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company as a result of which the holders of the voting securities of the Company prior to such transaction in the aggregate cease to own at least 70% of the voting securities of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof), (ii) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of more than 25% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or (iii) the acquisition, by a person or group (as such term is defined under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 25% of the voting securities of the Company whether by tender or exchange offer or otherwise.   
  
(f) Release Agreement. As a prior condition to receiving the severance benefits described in Sections 1.7(a), (b), (c) and (d) above, Executive agrees that he will first execute and deliver to the Company the Release Agreement attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.

(h) No Excess Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any portion of the benefits provided in Section 1.7 of this Agreement or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company (in the aggregate “Total Payments”) would constitute a “parachute payment” (as hereinafter defined), then the payments to be made to Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced such that the value of the aggregate Total Payments that Executive is entitled to receive shall be One Dollar ($1.00) less than the maximum amount which Executive may receive without becoming subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 4999, and which the Company may pay without loss of deduction under Section 280G of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “parachute payment” shall have the meaning assigned to it in Section 280G of the Code, and such “parachute payment” shall be valued as provided therein.   
  
(i) Delay of Severance Payments to Specified Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any amount payable to Executive under this Agreement on account of Executive’s separation from service with the Company constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and Executive is a Specified Employee on the date of his separation from service, payment of the amount shall be delayed until the first business day that is at least six (6) months after the date on which Executive’s separation from service occurred.

2.5. Survival Of Obligations. Certain of Executive’s obligations under this Agreement, including, Executive’s non-disclosure and non-competition obligations, survive the voluntary or involuntary termination of Executive’s employment with the Company.

2.6. Reasonableness Of Terms.
