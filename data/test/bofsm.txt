Schedule A – Bonus

Employee’s bonus will be divided into two categories – a discretionary bonus and a performance based bonus. The benchmark for the total bonus amount will be 20% of Employee’s then-current salary, as set out in Paragraph 3(a) if the Agreement. 

30% of the bonus will be discretionary, i.e., whether this portion of the bonus is awarded and the amount of the bonus will be in the sole discretion of Employer and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Crown Media Holdings, Inc. The maximum amount payable under this discretionary portion of the bonus would be 6% of current salary. 

The remaining 70% of the bonus will be awarded based on Crown Media Holdings, Inc. achievement of “Revenue” and “EBITDA” “Targets” for the year for which the bonus is paid – each will account for half of this portion of the bonus. The benchmark for each of the Revenue and EBITDA portions is 7% of salary, although a greater amount may be paid if Revenue and/or EBITDA Targets are exceeded. The formula for payment of this bonus based on percentage achievement of Revenue and EBITDA Targets is as follows:

Percentage of Revenue or EBITDA Target Achieved

Percentage of Salary Payable as Bonus  
  
Below 85%

No bonus  
  
85% or more but less than 90%

5.6%  
  
90% or more, but less than 95%

6.3%  
  
95% or more, but less than 98%

6.65%  
  
98% or more, but less than 102%

7%  
  
102% or more, but less than 105%

7.77%  
  
105% or more, but less than 110%

8.4%  
  
110% or more

10.5%  
  
By way of example, if 110% of the Revenue Target is achieved for the year and only 90% of the EBITDA Target is achieved, the total performance based portion of the bonus would equal

8

* * *

  


16.8% of salary (i.e. 10.5% for exceeding the Revenue Target and 6.3% for substantial achievement of the EBITDA Target.) 

“Revenue” for this purpose will be the sum of gross subscriber revenues and gross advertising sales revenues (less agency commissions) which are realized for accounting purposes by Employer in each fiscal year. “EBITDA” will have the meaning designated by Employer’s outside auditors, consistent with GAAP. The “targets” for each will be those designated in the Employer’s financial “Plan” for each fiscal year, as determined by the CEO of Employer and Board of Directors of Crown Media Holdings, Inc. Bonus payments shall be made on the dates designated by Employer for payment of bonuses to Crown employees in general.
