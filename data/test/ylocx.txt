The company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and Executive hereby agrees to be employed by the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(5) directly or indirectly, engage in any conduct or make any statement, whether in commercial or noncommercial speech, disparaging or criticizing in any way the Company or any of its affiliates, or any products or services offered by any of them, nor shall Executive engage in any other conduct or make any other statement that could be reasonably expected to impair the goodwill of any of the Company or any if its affiliates, the reputation of any products or services of the Company or any of its affiliates or the marketing of such products or services. 

(b) disclose, divulge, discuss, copy or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, other than in accordance with Executive’s duties hereunder (and in a manner not in violation or conflict with applicable laws and regulations), any confidential or proprietary information relating to the Company’s or any of its affiliates’ businesses, prospects, finances, operations, pricing, products, research and development or properties or other trade secrets of the Company or any of its affiliates, it being acknowledged and agreed by Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Company or any of its affiliates compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, Executive while Executive shall have been employed by or associated with the Company is confidential and/or proprietary information and the Company’s exclusive property; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to the extent that such information: (A) is clearly obtainable in the public domain; (B) becomes obtainable in the public domain, other than by reason of the breach by Executive of the terms hereof or breach by another person barred by a duty of confidentiality to the Company; or (C) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency. 

5.2 Litigation; Cooperation. If this Agreement is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason (as defined herein), the Executive

* * *

agrees that, for up to 12 months following the date of termination, he will provide to the Company and its affiliates truthful and complete cooperation including, but not limited to, the Executive’s appearance at interviews and depositions at reasonable times in all regulatory or litigation matters and proceedings relating to the Company and its affiliates, and to provide to the Company’s legal counsel, upon request, all documents and materials in his possession or under his control relating to such matters and proceedings, all at no additional compensation to the Executive, provided that the company shall reimburse promptly the Executive for all reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and other expenses, as well as pay to the Executive any amount of salary forfeited and including with respect to vacation time consumed by him during any time spent by Executive in connection with the foregoing.

(b) for a period of twelve (12) months after termination of employment or the expiration of the Employment Period. 

5.4 Injunctive Relief. Executive agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by his of this Section 5 will be inadequate and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 5 shall be deemed to limit the Company’s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 5 which may be pursued or availed of by the Company. 

5.5 Acknowledgment by Executive. Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon his and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Company under this Section 5, and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Executive, would not operate as a bar to Executive’s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and do not confer a benefit upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of Executive. 

6\. Proprietary Rights. 

6.1 Copyrights. At all times during the Employment Period, all right, title and interest in all copyrightable material which Executive shall conceive or originate, either individually or jointly with others, and which arise out of the performance of this Agreement, will be the property of the Company and are by this Agreement assigned to the Company along with ownership of any and all copyrights in the copyrightable material. At all times during the Employment Period, Executive agrees to execute all papers and perform all other acts necessary to assist the Company to obtain and register copyrights on such materials in any and all countries, and the Company agrees to pay expenses associated with such copyright registration. Works of authorship created by Executive for the Company in performing his responsibilities under this Agreement shall be considered “works made for hire” as defined in the U.S. Copyright Act. In addition, Executive hereby assignees to the Company all proprietary rights, including but not limited to, all patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks Executive might otherwise have, by operation of law or otherwise, in all inventions, discoveries, works, ideas, information, knowledge and data related to Executive’s access to confidential information of the Company during the Employment Period.

For purposes of this Agreement, “disability” shall mean a physical or mental disability that prevents or can be reasonably expected to prevent the performance by the Executive of his duties hereunder for a continuous period of 90 days or longer in any 12-month period. Determination of disability shall be supported by the report of an independent physician reasonably acceptable to the Company and Executive (or his representative), taking into account competent medical evidence, and otherwise shall be in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws.

performance of his material employment-related duties or responsibilities; or (v) breach of any material provision of this Agreement (in the case of (iii), (iv) and (v) above, that is not cured by the Executive within 30 days following receipt by the Executive of notice from the Company setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such Cause). A termination for Cause shall include a determination by the Board no later than 45 days following the termination of the Employment Period that circumstances existed during the Employment Period that would have justified a termination for Cause. A termination of the Executive by the Company shall not be a termination for Cause for purposes of this Agreement unless the determination to so terminate the Executive’s employment is made by a resolution of the Board (excluding the Executive) following a meeting convened upon not less than 10 days notice to the Executive and at which the Executive and his legal counsel, if any, shall have had a reasonable opportunity to be heard by the Board. 

7.3 Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate his employment with or without Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement “Good Reason” means, without Executive’s written consent: (i) a material diminution of Executive’s duties and responsibilities, or the assignment of responsibilities that are materially inconsistent with his position and responsibilities hereunder; (ii) a reduction of the Executive’s base salary, annual bonus or long-term compensation opportunity (it being understood that a reduction of the dollar amount of the Executive’s annual bonus from year to year solely as a result of achievement or failure to achieve target performance objectives shall not constitute a reduction in Executive’s bonus opportunity) or of the benefits made available to Executive as described herein; (iii) requiring Executive’s primary place of business to be located other than in south Florida (Broward, Dade or Palm Beach counties) or in the vicinity of Executive’s home residence address; (iv) a material breach by the Company of any other provision of this Agreement, in each case that is not cured by the Company within 30 days after its receipt from the Executive of written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such Good Reason. 

7.4 Termination Procedures. Any termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated to the other party by a notice of termination given in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a “notice of termination” means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon; (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for the termination under such provision; (iii) subject to this paragraph, specifies the date of termination (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, “date of termination” means (a) if the Executive’s employment is terminated other than for Cause or by reason of death or disability, 90 days following the receipt of the notice of termination, and (b) if the Executive’s employment is terminated for Cause or by reason of death or disability, the date of death or the date of the Board’s determination of Cause or of Executive’s disability, in accordance with this Agreement, provided that the Company may elect to pay the Executive (at the rate of his base salary then in effect) in lieu of part or all of such notice period preceding the date of termination. 

7.5 Effect of Termination. Effective as of any date of termination or, if earlier, as of any date specified by the Company at or following the delivery of a notice of termination, the Executive shall resign, in writing, from all Board memberships and all other positions held by him with the Company and its affiliates.
