Exhibit 10.3 

NON-EMPLOYEE BOARD MEMBER



Dear  : 

Broadcom Corporation (the “Corporation”) is pleased to inform you that you have been awarded Restricted Stock Units (the “Units”) under the Corporation’s 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Plan”). To the extent they become vested, the Units will entitle you to receive shares of the Corporation’s Class A common stock (the “Common Stock”) in a series of installments over your period of continued service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). 

The Units are a non-voting bookkeeping device used under the Plan solely to determine any share issuance to eventually be made to you if and when the Units vest. Each Unit represents the right to receive one share of the Corporation’s Common Stock on the vesting date of that Unit. Unlike a typical stock option grant, the shares will be issued to you for your continued service as a Board member over the vesting period, without any cash payment required from you. 

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the body of this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix. 

This Agreement sets forth the number of Units and underlying number of shares of Common Stock subject to your award, the applicable vesting schedule for those Units and underlying shares, the dates on which your vested shares will be issued to you and the remaining terms and conditions governing your award (the “Award”).   
  
Award Date: 

, 200  
  
Number of Units Subject to Award: 

16,668 units representing an equal number of shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”)  
  
Vesting Schedule: 

The Units will vest in a series of four (4) successive equal annual installments upon your completion of each successive one-year period of continued Board service over the four (4)-year period measured from the 5th day of ___, 200___. The Units will also be subject to accelerated vesting in accordance with the applicable provisions of Paragraphs 1 and 6 below.  
  
Issuance Schedule: 

The Shares will be issued immediately upon the vesting of the Units in accordance with the foregoing Vesting Schedule.  
  
* * *

##### 

Other important features of your Award are as follows: 

1\. Forfeitability. The vesting schedule requires your continued service as a Board member through the applicable vesting date for each annual installment of the Award as a condition to the vesting of that installment and the related rights and benefits under this Agreement. Service as a Board member for only a portion of a vesting installment period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle you to any proportionate vesting of that installment or avoid or mitigate the forfeiture that occurs upon the cessation of your service as a Board member. However, all the Shares subject to your Award will vest in full and become immediately issuable should your service as a Board member terminate by reason of your death or Permanent Disability. 

Should you cease to serve as a Board member prior to vesting in one or more Units subject to your Award, your Award will be cancelled with respect to those unvested Units (and the underlying Shares) on the first date you are no longer a Board member. The number of your Units will be reduced accordingly, and you will cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled Units. 

2\. Transferability. Prior to your actual receipt of the Shares in which you vest under your Award, you may not transfer any interest in your Award, your Units or the underlying Shares or pledge or otherwise hedge the sale of those Units or Shares, including (without limitation) any short sale or any acquisition or disposition of any put or call option or other instrument tied to the value of those Shares. However, your right to receive any Shares which have vested under your Units at or prior to your death but which remain unissued at the time of your death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of your will or trust or the laws of inheritance or to your designated beneficiary following your death. You may also direct the Corporation to issue the stock certificates for any Shares which in fact vest and become issuable under your Award to one or more designated family members or a trust established for yourself and/or your family members. You may make such a beneficiary designation or certificate directive at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designee. 

3\. Shareholder Rights. The Units create no fiduciary duty to you, and shall create only a contractual obligation on the part of the Corporation to issue Shares, subject to vesting and other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. The Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind. 

You will not have any shareholder rights, including voting rights or dividend rights, with respect to the Shares subject to your Award until you become the record holder of those Shares upon their actual issuance to you following the Corporation’s collection of any applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 4, no adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate evidencing the shares. 

Issuance of the underlying Shares upon the vesting of the corresponding Units shall be in complete satisfaction of such vested Units.

4\. Adjustments. Should any change be made to the Common Stock subject to your Award by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments will be made to the number and/or class of securities issuable hereunder and the number and/or class of securities that vest on each vesting date pursuant to the Vesting Schedule set forth above. 

5\. Federal Income Taxation. You will recognize ordinary income for federal income tax purposes on each date the Shares subject to your Award vest, whether pursuant to the normal Vesting Schedule above or the special acceleration provisions of Paragraph 1 or Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. The amount of your taxable income on each vesting date will be equal to the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on that date times the number of Shares in which you vest on that date. 

6\. Change in Control/Hostile Take-Over. Should a Change in Control transaction or a Hostile Take-Over occur during your period of service as a Board member, any Units at the time subject to your Award will vest immediately prior to the consummation of the Change in Control or Hostile Take-Over. The Shares subject to those vested Units will be issued immediately (or otherwise converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Common Stock payable to the other shareholders of the Corporation in consummation of the Change in Control, if applicable). 

7\. Securities Law Compliance. The Corporation will use its reasonable commercial efforts to assure that all Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement are registered under the federal securities laws. However, no Shares will be issued pursuant to your Award if such issuance would otherwise constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations or the requirements of the NASDAQ National Market or any Stock Exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Corporation to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Corporation to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares hereunder shall defer the Corporation’s obligation with respect to the issuance of such Shares until such approval shall have been obtained. 

8\. Transfer Restriction. None of the issued Shares may be sold or transferred in contravention of (i) any market blackout periods the Corporation may impose from time to time or (ii) the Corporation’s insider trading policies to the extent applicable to you from time to time. 

9\. Benefit Limit. In the event the accelerated vesting and issuance of the Shares subject to your Award would otherwise constitute a parachute payment under Code Section 280G, the accelerated vesting and issuance of those Shares shall be subject to reduction to the extent necessary to assure that the number of Shares which vest and are issued to you on such accelerated basis will be limited to the greater of (i) the number of Shares which can vest and be issued on such an accelerated basis without triggering a parachute payment under Code Section 280G or (ii) the maximum number of Shares which can vest and be issued on such

##### 

accelerated basis to provide you with the greatest after-tax amount of such accelerated vesting and issuance of the Shares subject to your Award after taking into account any excise tax you incur under Code Section 4999 with respect to those accelerated Shares and any other benefits or payments to which you may be entitled in connection with any change in control or ownership of the Corporation. 

10\. Notice. Any notice to be given or delivered to the Corporation relating to this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice to be given or delivered to you relating to this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to you at the address indicated below your signature line on the last page of this Agreement or such other address of which you later advise the Corporation in writing. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

11\. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns and upon you and the legal representatives, heirs and the legatees of your estate. 

12\. Construction. This Agreement and the Award evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to interpret and construe any term or provision of the Plan or this Agreement, and such interpretation shall be binding on all persons having an interest in the Award. 

13\. Governing Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to that State’s conflict-of-laws rules. 

14\. No Impairment of Rights. This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise make changes in its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. In addition, this Agreement shall not in any way be construed or interpreted so as to affect adversely or otherwise impair the right of the Corporation or its shareholders to remove you from the Board at any time in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. 

15\. MANDATORY ARBITRATION. ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND THE CORPORATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR OTHERWISE CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS EVIDENCED HEREBY OR THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SETTLED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION TO BE HELD IN ORANGE COUNTY.

GREATER, REMEDIAL AUTHORITY AS WOULD A COURT HEARING THE SAME DISPUTE. THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE FINAL, CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION AND SHALL BE IN LIEU OF THE RIGHTS THOSE PARTIES MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH DECISION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CORRECTION, CONFIRMATION OR VACATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND STANDARDS OF APPLICABLE LAW GOVERNING THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ARBITRATION AWARDS. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN SUCH ARBITRATION, AS DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR, AND IN ANY ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, SHALL BE ENTITLED, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE OTHER PARTY FOR ALL OF THE PREVAILING PARTY’S COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEY’S FEES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF THE CORPORATION IS NOT THE PREVAILING PARTY, THE ARBITRATOR’S COMPENSATION, FEES AND COSTS SHALL BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION IF SUCH COMPENSATION, FEES AND COSTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. JUDGMENT SHALL BE ENTERED ON THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY IN AN APPROPRIATE MATTER APPLY TO A COURT PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1281.8, OR ANY COMPARABLE STATUTORY PROVISION OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLE, FOR PROVISIONAL RELIEF, INCLUDING A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER OR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.
