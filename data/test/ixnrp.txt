WITNESSETH:

  


  


WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the Teledyne Technologies Incorporated 2008 Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”), which is administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company; and

  


WHEREAS, the Executive is employed by the Employer, and the Employer is a subsidiary of the Company;

  


WHEREAS, pursuant to Article 9 of the Plan, the Committee has determined to grant to the Executive an Award of Restricted Stock Units as provided herein (the “Award”) to encourage the Executive's efforts toward the continuing long-term success of the Employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries;

  


NOW, THEREFORE, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  


1. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

  


1.1 Grant of Restricted Stock Units.

  


(a) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Executive in respect of employment services provided by the Executive to the Employer, an Award of [INSERT NUMBER OF UNITS] Restricted Stock Units. The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Award shall be subject to the Executive providing evidence of the Executive's acceptance of this Agreement (or the Executive's estate, if applicable) to the Company. Subject to Section 1.4 of this Agreement, each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one (1) share of Common Stock at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 1.5 hereof.

  


  


  


  


* * *

  


  


(b) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance and consistent with, and is subject to, the provisions of the Plan (the provisions of which are hereby incorporated by reference), as well as any and all determinations, policies, instructions, interpretations, rules, etc., of the Committee in connection with the Plan (the “Rules”). The Company reserves the right to amend the Plan and any Rules at any time in its sole discretion, subject to the approval of the Committee. The Executive hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.

  


1.2 Restrictions.

  


The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and may not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated except as specifically provided hereunder or pursuant to the Plan. Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Stock Units or any interest therein in a manner contrary to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan shall be null, void and ineffective.

  


1.3 Vesting.

  


(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, 100% of the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Award shall vest on December 31, [YEAR 3].

  


(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, none of the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Award shall vest if the Committee determines that the Company's aggregate return to shareholders for the Performance Cycle, as measured by the Company's Common Stock price, is not at least 35% of the performance of the Russell 2000 Index for the applicable Performance Cycle.

  


(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Committee determines that the Company's aggregate return to shareholders for the Performance Cycle is at least 35% of the performance of the Russell 2000 Index for the Performance Cycle, a portion of the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Award shall not vest equal to (i) the aggregate number of Restricted Stock Units reduced by (ii) the quotient of the aggregate number of Restricted Stock Units multiplied by the TDY Stock Price-Russell 2000 Percentage (but not more than 100%) (any fractional share of Common Stock resulting from this clause (ii) calculation shall be rounded up to the next whole share).

  


(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if during the applicable Performance Cycle, (i) the Executive's employment with the Employer terminates for any reason, whether the Executive's employment is terminated by the Executive or the Employer, with or without just cause, except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 1.3(e), (ii) there occurs a material breach of this Agreement by the Executive or (iii) the Executive fails to meet the tax withholding obligations described in Paragraph 1.6, none of the unvested Restricted Stock Units granted under this Agreement shall vest. For clarity, for the purposes of this Agreement, the date of such termination or cessation of the Executive's employment with the Employer shall be the date upon which the Executive's employment actually ceased without regard to any period of notice of termination of employment to which the Executive may be entitled. 

  


(e) If, during the applicable Performance Cycle, the Executive's employment with the Employer terminates due to the Executive's death, disability (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) or retirement pursuant to the applicable retirement policy (if any) of the Employer or the Company (as applicable) prior to the expiration of the Performance Cycle, the Executive (or the Executive's beneficiaries) shall continue to hold the Restricted Stock Units through the expiration of the Performance Cycle. At that time, a portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall vest equal to (i) the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested under Section 1.3 had the Executive remained employed by the Employer through the end of the Performance Cycle multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which 

  


  


* * *

  


  


is the number of full months during which the Executive was employed by the Employer from the beginning of the Performance Cycle until the date of the Executive's termination of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Performance Cycle (any fractional share of Common Stock resulting from this calculation shall be rounded up to the next whole share).

  


(f) For purposes of this Section 1.3 only, “Employer” shall mean, in addition to Teledyne DALSA, Inc., the Company and any subsidiary of the Company.

  


1.4 Forfeiture of Award

  


Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all Restricted Stock Units that do not vest in accordance with Section 1.3 shall be forfeited and shall revert to the Company.

  


1.5 Satisfaction of Award

  


(a) In order to satisfy Restricted Stock Units upon the vesting of any portion of the Award pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to the Executive the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, subject to any applicable withholding tax.

  


(b) The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued by the Company at any particular time pursuant to this Agreement shall correspond to the number of Restricted Stock Units that become vested on the vesting date, with one (1) Restricted Stock Unit corresponding to one (1) share of Common Stock, subject to any withholding as may be required under this Agreement, notwithstanding any delay between the vesting date and the settlement date. Fractional shares of Common Stock will not be issued and will be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. The number and kind of shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other change in capitalization with a similar substantive effect upon each Restricted Stock Unit or the shares issuable in satisfaction of each Restricted Stock Unit. Until such time as shares of Common Stock are issued in satisfaction of a Restricted Stock Unit, as provided hereunder, the Executive shall not be deemed for any purpose to be a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares as to which the Restricted Stock Unit relates.

  


(c) The Company will satisfy its obligations to deliver Common Stock under this Agreement on each vesting date or as soon as administratively practicable but no later than the later of (a) December 31 of the year in which the vesting date occurs or (b) sixty (60) days after such vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Restricted Stock Units that become vested (other than as a result of the Executive's death), if the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code as of the date upon which the Executive's employment with the Employer terminates and settlement of such Restricted Stock Units is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then the Company shall satisfy its obligations to deliver Common Stock under this Agreement by the later of (i) the date otherwise required by this Agreement or (ii) the first business day of the calendar month following the date which is six (6) months after the date upon which the Executive's employment terminates.

  


1.6 Withholding.

  


  


  


* * *

  


  


(a) The Committee shall determine the amount and timing of any withholding or other tax required by law to be withheld or paid by the Employer or the Company (as applicable) with respect to any income recognized by the Executive with respect to the Award.

  


(b) The Executive shall meet the applicable tax withholding obligation by paying the appropriate amount in cash to the Employer or the Company (as applicable). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Employer or the Company (as applicable) may, at their sole discretion, implement any other procedures to ensure that such tax withholding obligations are met, which procedures may include, without limitation, (i) increased withholding from the Executive's regular compensation, or (iii) the sale of a portion of the Common Stock acquired by the Executive pursuant to the Award, which sale may be required and initiated by the Employer or the Company (as applicable) on behalf of the Executive and a portion of the proceeds being remitted to the Employer or the Company (as applicable) to satisfy the required withholdings. 

  


1.7 Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company during the Performance Cycle, all of the Restricted Stock Units (not otherwise forfeited prior to the Change in Control) shall immediately vest.

(b) “Performance Cycle” shall specifically refer to the period commencing January 1, [YEAR 1] through December 31, [YEAR 3], including any adjustments to such Cycle made by the Committee.
