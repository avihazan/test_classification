2.1.1 Subject to the Subscription Agreement and the rules and regulations of the Commission, at any time and from time to time, Purchaser may make a one-time written demand upon the Company to file, within sixty (60) days after such written demand is made, a registration statement covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities on Form S-1, S-2 or S-3 as appropriate with the Commission (the “Demand Registration Statement”). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as soon after filing as practicable and to cause all of the Registrable Securities to be qualified in such state jurisdictions as the holders may request. 

2.1.2 Except as set forth herein, the Company shall take all reasonable steps necessary to keep the Registration Statement current and effective until the lesser of: (i) two years and (ii) until the Registrable Securities are transferable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without the volume limitations set forth in such rule. 

2.1.3 The Company shall be entitled to require that a holder or holders of Registrable Securities refrain from effecting any public sales or distributions of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement that has been declared effective by the Commission or otherwise, if the board of directors of the Company reasonably determines that such public sales or distributions would interfere in any material respect with any transaction involving the Company that the board of directors reasonably determines to be material to the Company.

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the one-time demand registration rights provided in this Section 2.1 shall be subject to the following additional limitations: 

(i) Company shall not be obligated to file such Registration Statement on a Form S-2 or S-3 if it does not then meet the requirements (including the financial statement requirements) of such Form, and if the Company is required to file a Form S-1, it should not be obligated to file the Form S-1 until it shall have prepared current financial statements as required by Form S-1;  
(ii) If, upon receipt of any request for registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.1, the Company has then engaged a reputable and nationally or regionally recognized securities or investment banking firm for a registered public offering of Shares of Common Stock, then the Company shall give notice of such negotiations to all holders of Registrable Securities within fifteen (15) days of the date upon which the Company received such holder’s request and the Company shall not, for sixty (60) days after giving such notice to such holders, be required to undertake a required registration of the Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.1 in response to such holder’s request; provided, however, that if such registration statement of such proposed public offering is not filed within sixty (60) days after the Company gives such notice to holders of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall respond to the holder’s request for registration of Registrable Securities and, unless otherwise required by the provisions of this Section 2.1, register such Registrable Securities, no later than twenty (20) days after the expiration of such sixty (60) day period and as provided herein.  
  
2.2 Piggyback Registration.

2.2.1 Subject to the terms hereof, if at any time or from time to time the Company or any shareholder of the Company shall determine to register any of its securities (except for registration statements relating to employee benefit plans or exchange offers), either for its own account or the account of a security holder, the Company will promptly give to the holders of Registrable Securities written notice thereof not less than 30 days prior to the filing of any registration statement; and include in such registration (and any related qualification under Blue Sky laws or other compliance), and in the underwriting involved therein, if any, such Registrable Securities as such holders may request in a writing delivered to the Company within twenty (20) days after the holders’ receipt of Company’s written notice. 

2.2.2 The holders of Registrable Securities may participate in any number of registrations until all of the Shares held by holders of Registrable Securities have been distributed pursuant to a registration or until the Shares are transferable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 

2.2.3 If any registration statement is an Underwritten Public Offering, the right of holders of Registrable Securities to registration pursuant to this Section shall be conditioned upon each such holder’s participation in such reasonable underwriting arrangements as the Company shall make regarding the offering, and the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the underwriting shall be limited to the extent provided herein. Holders of Registrable Securities and all other shareholders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Company and the other holders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, if the managing underwriter concludes in its reasonable judgment that the number of Shares to be registered for selling shareholders (including the holders of Registrable Securities) would materially adversely effect such offering, the number of Shares to be registered, together with the number of Shares of Common Stock or other securities held by other shareholders proposed to be registered in such offering, shall be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the number of Shares proposed to be sold by the holders of Registrable Securities as compared to the number of Shares proposed to be sold by all shareholders. If any holder of Registrable Securities disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the managing underwriter, delivered not less than 10 days before the effective date. The Registrable Securities

excluded by the managing underwriter or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration, and shall not be transferred in a public distribution prior to one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the registration statement relating thereto, or such other shorter period of time as the underwriters may require. 

2.2.4 The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not the holders of Registrable Securities have elected to include securities in such registration. 

2.3 Expenses of Registration. All Registration Expenses shall be borne by the Company. Unless otherwise stated herein, all Selling Expenses relating to securities registered on behalf of the holders of Registrable Securities shall be borne by the holders of Registrable Securities. 

2.4 Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration, qualification or compliance effected by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will keep the holders of Registrable Securities advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration, qualification and compliance and as to the completion thereof. At its expense, the Company will: 

2.4.1 Prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective until the distribution described in such registration statement has been completed; 

2.4.2 Furnish to each underwriter such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale of the Shares by such underwriter, and promptly furnish to each underwriter and the holders of Registrable Securities notice of any stop-order or similar notice issued by the Commission or any state agency charged with the regulation of securities, and notice of any NASDAQ or securities exchange listing; and 

2.4.3 Cause the Shares to be listed on the NASDAQ small-cap market or a securities exchange on which the Common Stock is approved for listing. 

2.5 Indemnification.

2.5.1 To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify each holder of Registrable Securities, each of its officers and directors and partners, and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, with respect to which registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this Agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, to the extent such expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other similar document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act applicable to the Company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and the Company will reimburse each holder of Registrable Securities, each of its officers and directors and partners, and each person controlling each holder of Registrable Securities, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity contained herein shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld); provided, further, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arising out of or is based on any untrue statement 

-4- 

* * *

##### 

or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities, such controlling person or such underwriter specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the indemnity contained herein shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability, or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of such holder of Registrable Securities (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, insofar as the foregoing indemnity relates to any such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in the preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the Commission at the time the registration statement becomes effective or in the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable rules of the Commission or in any supplement or addendum thereto, the indemnity agreement herein shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter if a copy of the final prospectus filed pursuant to such rules, together with all supplements and addenda thereto, was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such furnishing is required by the Securities Act. 

2.5.2 To the extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Securities will, if securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected pursuant to terms hereof, indemnify the Company, each of its directors and officers, each underwriter, if any, of the Company’s securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the Company or such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each other person selling the Company’s securities covered by such registration statement, each of such person’s officers and directors and each person controlling such persons within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) by such holder of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by such holder of Registrable Securities of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act applicable to holders of Registrable Securities and relating to action or inaction required of holders of Registrable Securities in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse the Company, such other persons, such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such holder of Registrable Securities specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the indemnity contained herein shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of such holder of Registrable Securities (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of such Holder of Registrable Securities under this Subsection 2.5.2 shall be limited in an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares sold by such holder of Registrable Securities, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful conduct by such holder of Registrable Securities. In addition, insofar as the foregoing indemnity relates to any such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in the preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the Commission at the time the registration statement becomes effective or in the final prospectus filed pursuant to applicable rules of the Commission or in any supplement or addendum thereto, the indemnity agreement herein shall not inure to the benefit of the Company or any underwriter, if a copy of the final prospectus filed pursuant to such rules, together with all supplements and addenda thereto, was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such furnishing is required by the Securities Act. 

2.5.3 Notwithstanding Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, each party entitled to indemnification under this Section (the “Indemnified Party”) shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the “Indemnifying Party”) promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party’s expense, and provided further that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement unless the 

-5- 

* * *

##### 

failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such action and provided further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or as to which the Indemnifying Party is asserting separate or different defenses, which defenses are inconsistent with the defenses of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. No Indemnified Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of each Indemnifying Party. 

2.5.4 If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and all shareholders offering securities in the offering (the “Selling Security Holders”) on the other from the offering of the Company’s securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause “(i)” above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause “(i)” above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Selling Security Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Selling Security Holders on the other shall be the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company on the one hand and the Selling Security Holders on the other. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Selling Security Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of material fact (or the omission) or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Selling Security Holders and the parties’ relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Selling Security Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section were based solely upon the number of entities from whom contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim, subject to the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Selling Shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount or make any other payments under this Agreement which in the aggregate exceed the proceeds received by such Selling Shareholder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

2.6 Certain Information.

2.6.1 The holders of Registrable Securities agree, with respect to any Registrable Securities included in any registration, to furnish to the Company such information regarding such holder, the Registrable Securities and the distribution proposed by the such holder as the Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein. 

2.6.2 The failure of the holder of Registrable Securities to furnish the information requested pursuant to Section 2.6.1 shall not affect the obligation of the Company to the other Selling Security Holders who furnish such information unless, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company or the underwriters, such failure impairs or may impair the legality of the Registration Statement or the underlying offering. 

2.7 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may at any time permit the sale of Restricted Securities (used herein as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its best lawful efforts to:

2.7.2 File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at all times during which the Company is subject to such reporting requirements); and

2.8 Transferability. The rights conferred by this Agreement shall be freely transferable to a recipient of Registrable Securities. 

2.9 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

2.10 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject hereof.
