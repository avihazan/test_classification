I.GRANT OF AWARD

Google has granted the Optionee an option to purchase shares of Capital Stock (the “Option”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, including any special terms and conditions for the jurisdiction in which the Optionee resides contained in Exhibit B or any other appendix hereto (the “Appendix”). Certain details of the Option, specifically the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to the Option (the “Option Shares”), the exercise price per Option Share, the vesting schedule of the Option, and the Option’s designation as an ISO or non-qualified Option (collectively, the “Option Details”) are accessible to the Optionee through the Optionee’s brokerage account and the Option Details are hereby incorporated into this Option Agreement by reference. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Option Agreement shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan.

II. TERMS OF OPTION

1\. Vesting and Exercisability of Option. 

(a) In General. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) below, the Option will vest and become exercisable with respect to the Option Shares in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Option Details, subject to the Optionee’s continued employment with, or service to, the Company on each applicable vesting date. In the event the Optionee ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company for any reason except his or her death (as set forth in subsection (b) below), if applicable, then the Option will be forfeited with respect to the then unvested Option Shares effective as of the date that the Optionee ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company (the “Termination Date”) and the Optionee will have no further rights to the Option with respect such unvested Option Shares.

(b) Death of Optionee. In the event that the Optionee ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company as a result of the Optionee’s death, then (i) the Option shall immediately vest and become exercisable with respect to all of the Option Shares as of the Termination Date; provided, that, if the Optionee is a director or executive officer (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder) of Google (each, a “Section 16 Person”) as of the Grant Date and/or as of the Optionee’s death, then such vesting acceleration shall not be applicable and the Option shall be forfeited with respect to the then unvested Option Shares effective as of the Termination Date, and (ii) after the Termination Date, the Option will be exercisable with respect to the vested Option Shares for the period specified in Section 2(b) below and may be exercised by the Optionee’s designated beneficiary, provided that such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Optionee’s death; in the absence of any such effective designation, the Option may be exercised by the administrator or executor of the Optionee’s estate. Any such administrator or executor must furnish Google with (A) written notice of his or her status as transferee, (B) a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer, and (C) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Option that are or would be applicable to the Optionee and to be bound by the acknowledgments made by the Optionee hereunder.

Exhibit 10.22

  


  


(a) Term of Option. Subject to earlier expiration upon the Optionee’s termination of employment with, or service to, the Company as provided in subsection (b) below, the Option will expire on the [tenth] anniversary of the Grant Date (such day, the “Expiration Date”). 

(b) Post-Termination Exercise Period. Upon the Optionee’s termination of employment with, or service to, the Company for any reason other than the Optionee’s death or Disability, the Option may be exercised with respect to the vested Option Shares for three (3) months following the Termination Date. For this purpose, “Disability” shall mean total and permanent disability as defined in the U.S. Department of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(4)(i)(A), provided that the Committee in its discretion may determine whether a total and permanent disability exists. Upon the Optionee’s termination of employment with, or service to, the Company by reason of the Optionee’s death or Disability, the Option may be exercised with respect to the vested Option Shares for twelve (12) months following the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date.

3\. Exercise of Option. The Option may be exercised with respect to the vested Option Shares, in whole or in part; provided, however that no partial exercise of the Option shall be for an aggregate Exercise Price of less than $1,000.

(a) Method of Exercise. The Option is exercisable by delivery of an electronic or physical exercise notice, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or such other form as permitted by the Committee from time to time and communicated to the Optionee (the “Exercise Notice”), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. If the Exercise Notice is not completed and delivered electronically through the Optionee’s brokerage account, then the Exercise Notice shall be delivered to the Stock Administration department of Google by e-mail or mail at the addresses shown below and shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares.

Exhibit 10.22

  


  


5\. Type of Option. If designated in the Option Details as an ISO, this Option is intended to qualify as an “incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code, but to the extent that the Option, or a portion thereof, fails for any reason to meet requirements of an “incentive stock option”, then it shall be treated as a non-qualified Option for all purposes under the Plan and this Option Agreement.

6\. Leave of Absence; Reduced Schedule. Vesting of the Option during (i) any leave of absence of the Optionee and (ii) any period during which the Optionee works a reduced schedule, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Leaves of Absence and Award Vesting Policy, as in effect on the Grant Date. 

7\. Taxes.

(a) Liability for Tax-Related Items. The Optionee acknowledges that the Optionee is ultimately liable and responsible for any and all income taxes (including federal, state and local income taxes), social insurance, payroll taxes and other tax-related withholding (the “Tax-Related Items”) arising in connection with the Option, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to such Tax-Related Items. The Optionee further acknowledges that the Company (i) does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Item in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting, exercise and valid transfer of the Option, or the subsequent sale of the Exercised Shares and (ii) does not commit, and is under no obligation, to structure the terms of the Option or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. 

(b) Payment of Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Option Agreement, no Exercised Shares shall be issued, and no sales proceeds shall be delivered, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee) have been made by the Optionee with respect to the payment of any taxes which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such Exercised Shares or such sales proceeds; provided, that if the Optionee fails to make satisfactory arrangements with respect to such taxes by the end of the calendar year in which the applicable exercise or transfer in the Award Transfer Program occurred, then the Option shall be forfeited with respect to the Exercised Shares or the sales proceeds and Google shall not be required to issue the Exercised Shares or deliver the sales proceeds.

(i) Exercise. Upon exercise of the Option, or a portion thereof, the Committee may use any method permitted by the Plan to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements attributable to the Option, or portion thereof, being exercised. 

(ii) Transfer. Upon transfer of the Option, or a portion thereof, in the Award Transfer Program, the Committee may use any method permitted by the Plan to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements attributable to the Option, or portion thereof, being transferred.

(iii) No fractional Exercised Shares shall be issued under this Option Agreement and all fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share with a cash payment in respect thereof.

8\. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Optionee nor any person claiming under or through the Optionee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of Google in respect of any Option Shares unless and until such shares of Capital Stock have been issued on the records of Google or its transfer agents or registrars. After such issuance, the Optionee will have all the rights as a stockholder of Google with respect to such shares of Capital Stock. 

9\. No Special Employment Rights; No Right to Future Awards. Nothing contained in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any right with respect to the continuation of his or her employment by, or service to, the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Optionee from the rate in existence at the Grant Date. The grant of the Option is at the sole discretion of Google and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of stock options, or

Exhibit 10.22

  


  


benefits in lieu of stock options, even if stock options have been awarded to the Optionee repeatedly in the past.

10\. Modification; Entire Agreement; Waiver. No modification of any provision of this Option Agreement which reduces the Optionee’s rights hereunder will be valid unless the same is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. This Option Agreement, including the Appendix and the Option Details, together with the Plan and the Exercise Notice, represent the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Option. The failure of Google to enforce at any time any provision of this Option Agreement will in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof. Google reserves the right, however, to the extent that Google deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally alter or modify the terms of the Option set forth in this Option Agreement in order to ensure that the Option qualifies for exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 409A”); provided, however that the Company makes no representations that the Option will be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A. 

11\. Binding Agreement. Subject to the limitation on the transferability of the Option contained herein, this Option Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

12\. Additional Conditions to Issuance of Shares of Capital Stock. Google shall not be required to issue any shares of Capital Stock hereunder prior to fulfillment of all the following conditions: (a) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares of Capital Stock under any federal or state law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, or under any stock exchange on which the shares of Capital Stock are listed for trading, which the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable; (b) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any federal or state governmental agency, which the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and (c) the lapse of such reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days following the applicable exercise date as the Committee may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience.

13\. Plan Governs. This Option Agreement is subject in all respects to all terms and provisions of the Plan and the Plan document is hereby incorporated into this Option Agreement. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Option Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will control. 

14\. Policy Against Insider Trading. By accepting the Option, the Optionee acknowledges that (a) a copy of Google’s Policy Against Insider Trading (the “Trading Policy”) has been made available to the Optionee, (b) the Optionee has had an opportunity to review the Trading Policy and (c) the Optionee is bound by all the terms and conditions of the Trading Policy.

15\. Committee Authority. The Committee has full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding upon the Optionee, the Company and all other interested persons. 

16\. Captions. Captions provided herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the scope, meaning, intent or interpretation of the provisions of this Option Agreement.

17\. Severability. In the event that any provision in this Option Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Option Agreement.

Accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Option Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith or exempt therefrom. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, the Optionee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with, or service to, the Company for purposes of this Option Agreement until the Optionee would be considered to have incurred a “separation from service” from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided pursuant to this Option shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A.
