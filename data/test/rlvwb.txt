1. Restricted Shares Held by the Share Custodian. The Recipient hereby authorizes and directs the Company to deliver any share certificate issued by the Company to evidence Restricted Shares to the Share Custodian to be held by the Share Custodian until the Restricted Shares become Vested Restricted Shares in accordance with the Vesting Schedule. When the Restricted Shares become Vested Restricted Shares, the Share Custodian shall deliver the Restricted Shares to the Recipient. In the event that the Recipient forfeits any of the Restricted Shares, and the number of Vested Restricted Shares includes a fraction of a share, the Share Custodian shall not be required to deliver the fractional share, and the Company may pay the Recipient the amount determined by the Company to be the estimated fair market value therefor. The Recipient hereby irrevocably appoints the Share Custodian, and any successor thereto, as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Recipient with full power and authority to execute any stock transfer power or other instrument necessary to transfer the Restricted Shares to the Company in accordance with this Award, in the name, place, and stead of the Recipient. The term of such appointment shall commence on the date of the Restricted Stock Grant and shall continue until the Restricted Shares are delivered to the Recipient as provided above. During the period that the Share Custodian holds the shares of Common Stock subject to this Section 1, the Recipient shall be entitled to all rights applicable to shares of Common Stock not so held, except as provided in Section 2 hereof. In the event the number of shares of Common Stock is increased or reduced by a change in the par value, split-up, stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification, merger, reorganization, consolidation, or otherwise, the Recipient agrees that any certificate representing shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company issued as a result of any of the foregoing shall be delivered to the Share Custodian and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Award as if initially granted thereunder. To effect the provisions of this Section, the Director shall complete an irrevocable stock power in favor of the Share Custodian in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

  


2. Dividends. The Recipient shall be entitled to dividends paid on all Restricted Shares which are at the date of dividend declaration Vested Restricted Shares or which subsequent to the dividend declaration date become Vested Restricted Shares. The Recipient shall not be entitled to receive dividends paid on Restricted Shares which are subsequently forfeited. Dividends paid on Restricted Shares will be held by the Company and transferred to the Recipient, without interest, on such date as the Restricted Shares become Vested Restricted Shares. 

  


3\.  Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall have the right to require the Recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirement, if any, upon the earlier of the vesting of the Restricted Shares or the effective date of an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such Restricted Shares.
