Any capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Plan. The term “Fiscal Year” shall mean the fiscal year of the Company which begins on November 1 of each calendar year and ends on October 31 of the next calendar year. 

1\. Rights to Purchase Restricted Stock. 

The Participant may elect to reduce the annual retainer and meeting fees otherwise payable to him in respect of his services as a member of the Board of the Company (“Director Compensation”) by a specified percentage (up to 100 percent) and, in lieu of receiving such specified percentage of Director Compensation, receive a number of Shares of the Company, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein (“Restricted Stock”), equal to the amount of such reduction divided by a dollar amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which such Restricted Stock is received. In the first year of the Participant’s eligibility to participate in the Plan, an election in respect of Director Compensation otherwise payable for the period of that initial year of eligibility subsequent to the election must be made within 30 days after the date that the Participant becomes eligible so to participate (the “Initial Election Deadline”). An election so made during the initial year of eligibility shall become irrevocable on the Initial Election Deadline and shall be effective beginning with the date that Director Compensation is otherwise payable (each such date, a “Director Payment Date”) that first occurs after the Initial Election Deadline. Any election to reduce Director Compensation otherwise payable in a calendar year after the Participant’s initial year of eligibility shall be effective beginning with the first Director Payment Date occurring on or after January 1 of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such election is made (and shall become irrevocable on December 31 of the calendar year in which such election is made with respect to the next calendar year). Any cancellation of, or other change in, any such Director Compensation reduction election shall become effective as of the first Director Payment Date occurring on or after January 1 of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which notice of such cancellation or change is filed (and any such notice shall become irrevocable on December 31 of the calendar year in which it is filed with respect to the next calendar year). 

Any Director Compensation reduction hereunder shall apply ratably to the Participant’s Director Compensation otherwise payable on each Director Payment Date covered by such election. Restricted Stock shall be issued or purchased by the Company for the account of the

3\. Terms of Restricted Stock. 

(a) The Restricted Stock is subject to forfeiture as provided herein and, during the Restriction Period defined below, may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of by the Participant, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state in which the Participant resides on the date of his death.
