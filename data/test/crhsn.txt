As the option becomes exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate and the option shall remain exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the option term under Paragraph 5 or 6.

5. Cessation of Service. The option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this option shall cease to be outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions become applicable:

### (a) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death or Disability) while this option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of ninety (90) days (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option, but in no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date.

### 

### (b) Should Optionee die while this option is outstanding, then the personal representative of Optionee’s estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to Optionee’s will or in accordance with the laws of inheritance shall have the right to exercise this option. Such right shall lapse, and this option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twelve (12) month period measured from the date of Optionee’s death or (ii) the Expiration Date.

### 

### (c) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Disability while this option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of twelve (12) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option. In no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date.

### 

### (d) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of Option Shares for which this Option is, at the time of Optionee’s cessation of Service, exercisable pursuant to the exercise schedule specified in Paragraph 4 or the special acceleration provisions of Paragraph 6. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares for which the option has not been exercised. To the extent Optionee is not vested in the Option Shares at the time of Optionee’s cessation of Service, this option shall immediately terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to those shares.

### 

6. Acceleration of Option.

### (a) In the event of any Corporate Transaction, the exercisability of this option, to the extent this option is not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate in full so that this option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become fully exercisable for all the Option Shares and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested shares of Common Stock. However, the exercisability of the Option Shares shall not so accelerate if and to the extent: (i) this option is assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in the Corporate Transaction of this option to the extent 

###

* * *

  


### 

### this option is not otherwise fully exercisable or (ii) this option is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested Option Shares at the time of the Corporate Transaction (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the Exercise Price payable for such shares) and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same exercise schedule applicable to those unvested Option Shares as set forth in Paragraph 4.

### 

### (b) In connection with any Corporate Transaction where the exercisability of this option automatically accelerates in full, this option shall be exercised prior to or in connection with the closing of such Corporate Transaction and, to the extent that this option is not so exercised, it shall terminate and cease to be outstanding immediately following the closing of such Corporate Transaction. Without limiting the generality of Section 5, a Change in Control that is not also a Corporate Transaction shall not effect the term of the option.

### 

### (c) If this option is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to Optionee in consummation of such Corporate Transaction had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same.

### 

### (d) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.

### 

7. Adjustment in Option Shares. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Company’s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or class of securities subject to this option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder.

8. Shareholder Rights. The holder of this option shall not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares.

9. Manner of Exercising Option.

### (a) In order to exercise this option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall provide written notice of Optionee’s election to exercise all or a portion of the option and shall take the following additional actions:

### 

#### (i) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares in one or more of the following forms:

##### 

##### (A) cash or check made payable to the Company; or

##### 

##### (B) a promissory note payable to the Company, but only to the extent authorized by the Board in accordance with Paragraph 13.

##### 

Should the Common Stock be registered under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act at the time the option is exercised, then the Exercise Price may also be paid as follows:

##### (C) in shares of Common Stock held by Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Company’s earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date; or

##### 

##### (D) through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (a) to a Company-designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company by reason of such exercise and (b) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale.

##### 

Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must accompany the notice delivered to the Company in connection with the option exercise.

#### (ii) Furnish to the Company appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this option.

#### 

#### (iii) Execute and deliver to the Company such written representations as may be requested by the Company in order for it to comply with the applicable requirements of U.S. Federal and state securities laws.

#### 

#### (iv) Make appropriate arrangements with the Company (or Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the option exercise.

### (b) As soon as practical after the Exercise Date, the Company shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the appropriate legends (if any) affixed thereto.

### 

### (c) In no event may this option be exercised for any fractional shares.

### 

10. Compliance with Laws and Regulations.

### (a) The exercise of this option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Company and Optionee with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or The Nasdaq Global Select Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance.

### 

### (b) The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals.

### 

11. Successors and Assigns.  Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3 and 6, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and assigns and Optionee, Optionee’s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Optionee’s estate.

12. Notices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Optionee shall be in writing and addressed to Optionee at the address indicated below Optionee’s signature line. All notices shall be deemed effective (i) upon personal delivery, (ii) five business days after being sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iii) two business days after being sent via reputable international overnight courier.

13. Financing. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without any obligation to do so, permit Optionee to pay the Exercise Price for the purchased Option Shares by delivering a full-recourse, interest-bearing promissory note secured by those Option Shares. The payment schedule in effect for any such promissory note shall be established by the Board in its sole discretion.

14. Non-Statutory Option. Optionee acknowledges that this option is not intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
