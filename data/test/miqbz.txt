Exhibit 10.5

  


INTEGRYS ENERGY GROUP, INC.



  


[Name]

  


You have been granted a nonqualified stock option with respect to shares of common stock of Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (the “Company”) under the Integrys Energy Group, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) This Agreement sets forth the terms, rights and obligations of you and the Company with respect to the grant of this option. This option shall not become effective until you sign and return the “Acknowledgement Form” from this Agreement to Human Resources.

The option is granted under, and is subject to, the terms of the Plan, which are specifically incorporated by reference in this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in this Agreement which are not defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.

1. Grant of Option. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company grants to you the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase ______ shares (the “Option”) of the common stock of the Company, par value $1.00 (the “Optioned Shares”) from the Company, at an option price per share equal to $_______, the closing sales price of a share of Common Stock of the Company as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction reporting system on February _____, 2011 (the “Grant Date”).

In the event of certain corporate transactions described in Section 12 of the Plan, the number of Optioned Shares and the per share option price will be adjusted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”). The Committee’s determination as to any adjustment shall be final.

2. Vesting of Option. The Optioned Shares will vest and become exercisable in accordance with the following schedule:

Percentage of Optioned Shares Vested Date of Vesting

  


25% 1st anniversary of Grant Date

An additional 25% 2nd anniversary of Grant Date

An additional 25% 3rd anniversary of Grant Date

The final 25% 4th anniversary of Grant Date

  


provided, however, that, in the event of your termination of employment from the Company and its Affiliates for any reason, any Optioned Shares not vested as of the date of such termination will be cancelled, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.

Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.

  


[Standard Paragraph #1 -- For use with the regular grants made in February or March of each year.] If your employment or service terminates as a result of death or disability (as determined by the Committee based upon the definition set forth in the Company’s 

* * *

long-term disability plan), (1) if your termination occurs on or after December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, the Optioned Shares will become fully vested on your date of termination, or (2) if your termination occurs prior to December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, you will become partially vested on the date of termination, and the remaining Optioned Shares will be cancelled. Your partially vested interest will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of service that the you completed during the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Opt ioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.

[Alternate Paragraph #1 -- For use in mid-year special grants where proration based on the calendar year might result in substantial vesting shortly following the Grant Date. Under the alternate paragraph, proration is based on the number of months of employment completed during the one year period from the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date] If your employment or service terminates as a result of death or disability (as determined by the Committee based upon the definition set forth in the Company’s long-term disability plan), (1) if your termination occurs on or after the first day of the twelfth (12th) month following the month in which occurs the Gran t Date, the Optioned Shares will become fully vested on your date of termination, or (2) if your termination occurs prior to the first day of the twelfth (12th) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, you will become partially vested on the date of termination, and the remaining Optioned Shares will be cancelled. Your partially vested interest will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of service that you completed during the twelve (12) month period that begins on the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.

[Standard Paragraph #2 -- For use with the regular grants made in February or March of each year.] If your employment or service terminates as a result of retirement on or after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of service, or retirement on or after age sixty-two (62) (“Retirement”), (1) if your Retirement occurs on or after December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment, and (2) if your Retirement occurs prior to December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, a portion of the Optioned Shares will be immediately forfeited, and the remainder of the Optioned Shares will con tinue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment. The portion of the Optioned Shares that are immediately forfeited will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is twelve (12) minus the number of full months of service that you completed during the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares. The number of

* * *

Optioned Shares available for exercise on or after each vesting date will be reduced by a pro rata portion of the total number of forfeited Optioned Shares.

[Alternate Paragraph #2 -- For use in mid-year special grants where proration based on the calendar year might result in substantial vesting shortly following the Grant Date. Under the alternate paragraph, proration is based on the number of months of employment completed during the one year period from the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date] If your employment or service terminates as a result of retirement on or after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of service, or retirement on or after age sixty-two (62) (“Retirement”), (1) if your Retirement occurs on or after the first day of the twelfth (12th) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment, and (2) if your Retirement occurs prior to the first day of the twelfth (12th) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, a portion of the Optioned Shares will be immediately forfeited, and the remainder of the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment. The portion of the Optioned Shares that are immediately forfeited will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is twelve (12) minus the number of full months of service that you completed during the twelve (12) month period that begins on the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares. The number of Optioned Shares available for exercise on or after each vesting date will be reduced by a pro rata portion of the total number of forfeited Optioned Shares.

Notwithstanding the vesting schedule described above, the Committee may extend the date(s) of vesting to a later date to take into account any period of the Optionee’s leave of absence, unless prohibited by law.

3. Exercise of Option. The Option, to the extent vested in accordance with Paragraph 2, may be exercised during the period beginning on the vesting date and ending on the earlier of:

a. 

the first anniversary of the date the Optionee’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason other than Retirement, death or disability (as determined by the Committee based on the definition set forth in the Company’s long-term disability plan); or  
  
b. 

in any other case, February ____, 2021.  
  
During your life, the Option may be exercised only by you (or if you are incapacitated, by your legal representative). If you die before exercising all of the vested Option, the executor of the your estate (or by such person as the executor of the estate certifies as inheriting the Option as a result of the operation of your last will and testament or as a result of the laws of interstate succession) may exercise all or any portion of the vested Option that has not been exercised, during the exercise periods described above.

4. Change in Control.
