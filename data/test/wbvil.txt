OF 

PRIORITY HEALTHCARE CORPORATION 

(As Amended July 16, 2003) 

ARTICLE I 

Meetings of Shareholders

Section 1.1. Annual Meetings. Annual meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be held on the second Monday of May of each year commencing in May, 1998, at such hour and at such place within or without the State of Indiana as shall be designated by the Board of Directors. In the absence of designation, the meeting shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation at 11:00 a.m. (local time). The Board of Directors may, by resolution, change the date or time of such annual meeting. If the day fixed for any annual meeting of shareholders shall fall on a legal holiday, then such annual meeting shall be held on the first following day that is not a legal holiday. 

Section 1.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation may be called at any time by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board and shall be called by the Board of Directors if the Secretary receives written, dated and signed demands for a special meeting, describing in reasonable detail the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held, from the holders of shares representing at least twenty-five percent (25%) of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting; provided, however, that any such demand(s) delivered to the Secretary at any time at which the Corporation has more than 50 shareholders must be properly delivered by the holders of shares representing at least eighty percent (80%) of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting. If the Secretary receives one (1) or more proper written demands for a special meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may set a record date for determining shareholders entitled to make such demand. The Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board, as the case may be, calling a special meeting of shareholders shall set the date, time and place of such meeting, which may be held within or without the State of Indiana. 

Section 1.3. Notices. A written notice, stating the date, time, and place of any meeting of the shareholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, shall be delivered or mailed by the Secretary of the Corporation, to each shareholder of record of the Corporation entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting no fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. In the event of a special meeting of shareholders required to be called as the result of a demand therefor made by shareholders, such notice shall be given no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the Corporation’s receipt of the demand requiring the meeting to be called. Notice of shareholders’ meetings, if mailed, 

* * *

shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each shareholder at his address shown in the Corporation’s current record of shareholders. 

Notice of a meeting of shareholders shall be given to shareholders not entitled to vote, but only if a purpose for the meeting is to vote on any amendment to the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, merger, or share exchange to which the Corporation would be a party, sale of the Corporation’s assets, dissolution of the Corporation, or consideration of voting rights to be accorded to shares acquired or to be acquired in a “control share acquisition” (as such term is defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law). Except as required by the foregoing sentence or as otherwise required by the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, notice of a meeting of shareholders is required to be given only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. 

A shareholder or his proxy may at any time waive notice of a meeting if the waiver is in writing and is delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the Corporation’s records. A shareholder’s attendance at a meeting, whether in person or by proxy, (a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder or his proxy at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (b) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder or his proxy objects to considering the matter when it is presented. Each shareholder who has, in the manner above provided, waived notice or objection to notice of a shareholders’ meeting shall be conclusively presumed to have been given due notice of such meeting, including the purpose or purposes thereof. 

If an annual or special shareholders’ meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment, unless a new record date is or must be established for the adjourned meeting. 

Section 1.4. Business of Shareholder Meetings. At an annual meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have the legal right and authority to make the proposal for consideration at the meeting and the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than seventy (70) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders (which notice or public disclosure shall include the date of the annual meeting specified in these By-Laws, if such By-Laws have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and if the annual meeting is held on such date), notice by the shareholder to 

2 

* * *

be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. A shareholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of the Corporation’s shares which are beneficially owned by the shareholder, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4. The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.4, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. At any special meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. 

Section 1.5. Notice of Shareholder Nominees. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or persons appointed by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.5. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than seventy (70) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders (which notice or public disclosure shall include the date of the annual meeting specified in these By-Laws, if such By-Laws have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and if the annual meeting is held on such date), notice by the shareholders to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) the class and number of the Corporation’s shares which are beneficially owned by such person and (iv) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such shareholder and (ii) the class and number of the Corporation’s shares which are beneficially owned by such shareholder. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of 

3 

* * *

the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these By-Laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. 

Section 1.6. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, each share of any class, other than Class A Common Stock, of the common stock of the Corporation that is outstanding at the record date established for any annual or special meeting of shareholders and is outstanding at the time of and represented in person or by proxy at the annual or special meeting, shall entitle the record holder thereof, or his proxy, to one (1) vote, or in the case of Class A Common Stock, three (3) votes, on each matter voted on at the meeting. 

Section 1.7. Quorum. Unless the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or the Indiana Business Corporation Law provide otherwise, at all meetings of shareholders, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for action on the matter. Action may be taken at a shareholders’ meeting only on matters with respect to which a quorum exists; provided, however, that any meeting of shareholders, including annual and special meetings and any adjournments thereof, may be adjourned to a later date although less than a quorum is present. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. 

Section 1.8. Vote Required To Take Action. If a quorum exists as to a matter to be considered at a meeting of shareholders, action on such matter (other than the election of Directors) is approved if the votes properly cast favoring the action exceed the votes properly cast opposing the action, except as the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or the Indiana Business Corporation Law require a greater number of affirmative votes. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes properly cast. 

Section 1.9. Record Date. Only such persons shall be entitled to notice of or to vote, in person or by proxy, at any shareholders’ meeting as shall appear as shareholders upon the books of the Corporation as of such record date as the Board of Directors shall determine, which date may not be earlier than the date seventy (70) days immediately preceding the meeting. In the absence of such determination, the record date shall be the fiftieth (50th) day immediately preceding the date of such meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shareholders shall be determined as of the close of business on the record date. 

Section 1.10. Proxies. A shareholder may vote his shares either in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder (including authorizing the proxy to receive, or to waive, notice of any shareholders’ meeting within the effective period of such proxy) by signing an appointment form, either personally or by the shareholder’s attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other 

4 

* * *

officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes and is effective for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. The proxy’s authority may be limited to a particular meeting or may be general and authorize the proxy to represent the shareholder at any meeting of shareholders held within the time provided in the appointment form. Subject to the Indiana Business Corporation Law and to any express limitation on the proxy’s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment. 

Section 1.11. Removal of Directors. Any or all of the members of the Board of Directors may be removed, for good cause, only at a meeting of the shareholders called expressly for that purpose, by a vote of the holders of outstanding shares representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the votes then entitled to be cast at an election of Directors. Directors may not be removed in the absence of good cause. 

Section 1.12. Written Consents. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholders’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Action taken under this Section 1.12 is effective when the last shareholder signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in which case the action is effective on or as of the specified date. Such consent shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of all shareholders and may be described as such in any document. 

Section 1.13. Participation by Conference Telephone. The Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors may permit any or all shareholders to participate in an annual or special meeting of shareholders by, or through the use of, any means of communication, such as conference telephone, by which all shareholders participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A shareholder participating in a meeting by such means shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting. 

ARTICLE II 

Directors

Section 2.1. Number and Terms. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of nine (9) Directors. The Directors shall be divided into three (3) groups, with each group consisting of one-third (1/3) of the total directors, as near as may be, with the term of office for the first group to expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2002, the term of office for the second group to expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2003, and the term of office for the third group to expire at the annual shareholders meeting in 2004; and at each annual meeting of shareholders, the Directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as being the same group as the Directors they succeed and shall be elected for a 

5 

* * *

term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

Despite the expiration of a Director’s term, the Director shall continue to serve until his successor is elected and qualified, or until the earlier of his death, resignation, disqualification or removal, or until there is a decrease in the number of Directors. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, from whatever cause arising, shall be filled by selection of a successor by a majority vote of the remaining members of the Board of Directors (although less than a quorum); provided, however, that if any such vacancy or vacancies leave the Board of Directors with no members or if the remaining members of the Board are unable to agree upon a successor or determine not to elect a successor, such a vacancy may be filled by a vote of shareholders at a special meeting called for that purpose or at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The term of a Director elected or selected to fill a vacancy shall expire at the end of the term for which such Director’s predecessor was elected, or if the vacancy arises because of an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, at the end of the term specified at the time of election or selection. 

The Directors and each of them shall have no authority to bind the Corporation except when acting as a Board. 

Section 2.2. Quorum and Vote Required To Take Action. A majority of the whole Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, except the filling of vacancies. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by the Indiana Business Corporation Law, the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws. 

Section 2.3. Annual and Regular Meetings. The Board of Directors shall meet annually, without notice, immediately following the annual meeting of the shareholders, for the purpose of transacting such business as properly may come before the meeting. Other regular meetings of the Board of Directors, in addition to said annual meeting, shall be held on such dates, at such times and at such places as shall be fixed by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and specified in a notice of each such regular meeting, or otherwise communicated to the Directors. The Board of Directors may at any time alter the date for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors. 

Section 2.4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by any member of the Board of Directors upon not less than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice given to each Director of the date, time, and place of the meeting, which notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting. Such notice may be communicated in person (either in writing or orally), by telephone, telegraph, teletype, or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by mail, and shall be effective at the earlier of the time of its receipt or, if mailed, five (5) days after its mailing. Notice of any meeting of the Board may be waived in writing at any time if the waiver is signed by the Director entitled to the notice and is filed with the minutes or corporate records. A Director’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the Director of the meeting, unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon the 

6 

* * *

Director’s arrival) objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. 

Section 2.5. Written Consents. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board. The action must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each Director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 2.5 is effective when the last Director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in which case the action is effective on or as of the specified date. A consent signed under this Section 2.5 shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of all members of the Board and may be described as such in any document. 

Section 2.6. Participation by Conference Telephone. The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or through the use of, any means of communication, such as conference telephone, by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by such means shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting. 

Section 2.7. Executive Committee. The Board of Directors may appoint three (3) members to an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee shall, subject to the restrictions of Section 2.9, be authorized to exercise the authority of the full Board of Directors at any times other than during regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors. All actions taken by the Executive Committee shall be reported at the first regular meeting of the Board of Directors following such actions. Members of the Executive Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. 

Section 2.8. Other Committees. The Board of Directors may create one (1) or more committees in addition to any Executive Committee and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them, by resolution of the Board of Directors adopted by a majority of all the Directors in office when the resolution is adopted. The committee may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors to the extent specified in the resolution. Each committee may have one (1) or more members, and all the members of such committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. 

Section 2.9. Limitations on Committees; Notice, Quorum and Voting. 

(a) Neither the Executive Committee nor any other committee hereafter established may: 

(1) authorize dividends or other distributions, except a committee may authorize or approve a reacquisition of shares if done according to a formula or method prescribed by the Board of Directors;   
  
(2) approve or propose to shareholders action that is required to be approved by shareholders;   
  
7

(5) adopt, amend, repeal, or waive provisions of these By-Laws;   
  
(6) approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval; or   
  
(7) authorize or approve the issuance or sale or a contract for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights, preferences, and limitations of a class or series of shares, except the Board of Directors may authorize a committee (or an executive officer of the Corporation designated by the Board of Directors) to take the action described in this Section 2.9(a)(7) within limits prescribed by the Board of Directors.   
  
(b) Except to the extent inconsistent with the resolutions creating a committee, Sections 2.1 through 2.6 of these By-Laws, which govern meetings, action without meetings, notice and waiver of notice, quorum and voting requirements and telephone participation in meetings of the Board of Directors, apply to each committee and its members as well.
