Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.  
2. Exercise of Option. The exercise of the Option is subject to the following conditions and restrictions:  
(a) Expiration. Upon vesting of the underlying shares, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part until the earlier of (i) the above Expiration Date, or (ii) the expiration of the applicable period following your termination of employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries, as provided in Sections 2(c),(d) or (e) below.  
(b) Schedule of Exercisability. The Option shall become vested and exercisable to the extent of __% of the above number of shares of Common Stock on __________________.

(c) Death. Notwithstanding the schedule of exercisability set forth in Section 2(b) above, the Option shall become immediately exercisable in full upon your death, and may be exercised by your Successor (as defined below) at any time, or from time to time, within five years after the date of your death. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Successor” shall mean the legal representative of your estate or the person or persons who may, by bequest or inheritance, or valid beneficiary designation (as provided in Section 15 of the Plan), acquire the right to exercise the Option.  
(d) Disability or Retirement.

(g) Expiration of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs (a)-(f), in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date.  
3. Manner of Exercise. To exercise your Option, you must deliver notice of exercise (the “Notice”) to UBS Financial Services. The Notice must specify the number of shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) as to which the Option is being exercised and must be accompanied by payment of the purchase price for the Shares in cash, check, or by the delivery of Common Stock already owned by you, or by a combination thereof, pursuant to such forms and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed from time to time by the Committee.  
  
Exercise shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of the date the Notice and option cost payment are received by UBS Financial Services or the date you simultaneously exercise the Option and sell the shares, using the proceeds from such sale to pay the purchase price.  
4. Withholding Taxes. You are responsible for payment of any federal, state, local or other taxes which must be withheld upon the exercise of the Option, and you must promptly pay to the Company any such taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries are authorized to deduct from any payment owed to you any taxes required to be withheld with respect to the Shares, including social security and Medicare (FICA) taxes and federal, state and local income tax with respect to income arising from the exercise of the Option. The Company shall have the right to require the payment of any such taxes before issuing any Shares pursuant to an exercise of the Option. In lieu of all or any part of a cash payment, you may elect to have a portion of the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option withheld by the Company to satisfy all or part of the withholding tax requirements relating to the Option exercise with such Shares valued in the same manner as used in computing such withholding taxes. Any fractional share amount due relating to such tax withholding will be rounded up to the nearest whole share and the additional amount will be added to your federal withholding.  
5. Forfeitures. If you have received or been entitled to receive payment in cash, delivery of Common Stock or a combination thereof pursuant to this Option within the period beginning six months prior to termination of your employment with the Company or any Affiliate and ending when the Option expires in accordance with Section 2(a), the Company, in its sole discretion, may require you to return or forfeit the cash and/or Common Stock received or receivable with respect to this Option (or its economic value as of the date of the exercise of the Option), in the event you engage in any of the following activities:  
a. performing services for or on behalf of any competitor of, or competing with, the Company or any Affiliate within six months of the date of your termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate;  
b. unauthorized disclosure of material proprietary information of the Company or any Affiliate;  
c. a violation of applicable business ethics policies or business policies of the Company or any Affiliate; or  
d. any other occurrence determined by the Committee.  
  
The Company’s right to require forfeiture must be exercised not later than 90 days after the Company acquires actual knowledge of such an activity but in no event later than 12 months after your termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate. Such right shall be deemed to be exercised upon the Company’s mailing written notice of such exercise to your most recent home address as shown on the personnel records of the Company. In addition to requiring forfeiture as described herein, the Company may exercise its rights under this Section 4 by preventing or terminating the exercise of any rights under this Option or the acquisition of Shares or cash thereunder.

If you fail or refuse to forfeit the cash and/or Shares demanded by the Company (adjusted for any events described in Section 11(a) of the Plan), you shall be liable to the Company for damages equal to the number of Shares demanded times the highest closing price per share of the Common
