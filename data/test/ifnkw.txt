B. The Plan provides for the granting of restricted stock awards to eligible participants as determined by the Administrator; and

C. The Administrator has determined that Participant is a person eligible to receive a restricted stock award under the Plan and has determined that it would be in the best interest of the Corporation to grant the restricted stock award provided for herein.

AGREEMENT

1. Grant of Restricted Stock.

(a) Stock. Pursuant to the Plan, Executive is hereby awarded Fifty Thousand (50,000) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”), subject to the conditions of the Plan and this Agreement (the “Restricted Stock”).

(b) Plan Incorporated. Executive acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan, and agrees that, except as contemplated by Section 9 below, this award of Restricted Stock shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, including future amendments thereto, if any, pursuant to the terms thereof, which Plan is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. Except as defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them under the Plan.

2. Terms of Restricted Stock. Executive hereby accepts the Restricted Stock and agrees with respect thereto as follows:

(a) Vesting. The Restricted Stock shall vest in equal increments, and no longer be subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions (as defined below) on each of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 (the “Time Vesting Provisions”); provided that; the compensation committee of the Company’s Board certifies by June 1, 2010 that certain performance metrics for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been met (the “Performance Provisions”). In the event such certification is not obtained by June 1, 2010, the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the Time Vesting Provisions, the Restricted Stock shall immediately vest and no longer be subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions (as defined below) upon (i) the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, (ii) the date Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of death or Total Disability (as defined below), (iii) the termination of Executive’s employment by the Company without Cause (as defined in Executive’s Second Amended and Restated Employment 

* * *

  


Agreement dated March 10, 2008, as amended on August 15, 2008), or (iv) the termination of Executive’s employment in connection with a Transition Event (as defined in the Executive’s Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated as of the date hereof). In addition, upon a voluntary resignation by Executive, the Forfeiture Restrictions on a pro rata portion as defined below (the “Pro Rata Portion”) of the Restricted Stock shall lapse, and the Pro Rata Portion shall immediately vest. The Pro Rata Portion shall be equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock which the Executive would have been entitled to at the next vesting date had the Executive’s employment not terminated, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days elapsed from the beginning of the calendar year through and including the date of termination and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the applicable calendar year. All other shares of Restricted Stock under this Agreement will be forfeited. For example, were such a resignation to occur on June 30, 2011, 12,397 shares of the Restricted Stock will immediately vest (25,000 x 181/365) and the remaining 37,603 shares will be forfeited, or were such a resignation to occur on June 30, 2012, 25,000 shares of the Restricted Stock would have vested on December 31, 2011, an additional 12,432 shares shall immediately vest on the date of resignation (25,000 x 182/366) and the remaining 12,568 shares will be forfeited.

(b) Forfeiture of Restricted Stock. In addition to any possible forfeiture of Restricted Stock as contemplated by Paragraph 2(a) (Performance Provisions not met or voluntary resignation), in the event of a termination of Executive’s employment for Cause (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated March 10, 2008, as amended on August 15, 2008), Executive shall, for no consideration, forfeit all Restricted Stock to the extent such Restricted Stock is then subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions. The obligation to forfeit and surrender Restricted Stock to the Company upon termination of Executive’s employment or service and the prohibition against transfer in Paragraph 2(f) below are herein referred to as “Forfeiture Restrictions.”

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Event” shall have the following definition (and not the definition stated in the Plan):

(i) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (a “Person”)) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than 30% or more of either (1) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “Outstanding Company Common Stock”) or (2) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the “Outstanding Company Voting Securities”); provided, however, that, for purposes of this definition, the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control Event; (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or a successor, or (D) any acquisition by any entity pursuant to a transaction that complies with subsections (iii)(A), (B) and (C) below;

(b) In order to comply with all applicable federal or state income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal or state payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of Executive, are withheld or collected from Executive.

(c) In accordance with the terms of the Plan, and such rules as may be adopted by the Administrator under the Plan, Executive may elect to satisfy Executive’s federal and state tax withholding obligations arising from the receipt of, or the lapse of restrictions relating to, the Restricted Stock, by (i) delivering cash, check (bank check, certified check or personal check) or money order payable to the Company, (ii) having the Company withhold a portion of the Restricted Stock otherwise to be delivered having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes, or (iii) delivering to the Company shares of Common Stock already owned by Executive having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such tax withholding. The delivery of any shares under the preceding subsection (iii) must have been owned by Executive for no less than six months prior to the date delivered to the Company if such shares were acquired upon the exercise of an option or upon the vesting of restricted stock units or other restricted stock. The Company will not deliver any fractional shares of Common Stock but will pay, in lieu thereof, the Fair Market Value of such fractional shares of Common Stock. Executive’s election must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined, or else the Company shall be entitled to elect the method in which Executive’s federal and state withholding obligations shall be satisfied.

4. Status of Stock. Executive agrees that the Restricted Stock will not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws. Executive also agrees (i) that the certificates representing the Restricted Stock may bear such legend or legends as the Company deems appropriate in order to assure compliance with applicable securities laws, (ii) that the Company may refuse to register the transfer of the Restricted Stock on the stock transfer records of the Company if such proposed transfer would be in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company constitute a violation of any applicable securities law and (iii) that the Company may give related instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of the Restricted Stock.

9. Conflicts and Interpretation. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, this Agreement shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Administrator has the power, among others, to (i) interpret the Plan, (ii) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan and (iii) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

10. Amendment. The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall impair the rights of Executive without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, NASDAQ or stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. Prior to the effectiveness of any modification, amendment or waiver required by tax or accounting rules, the Company will provide notice to Executive and the opportunity for Executive to consult with the Company regarding such modification, amendment or waiver. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.

11. Tax Election. Executive agrees that he will not make an election described in Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Agreement.

12. Section 409A Savings Clause. It is the intention of the parties that compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. To the extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to such Section, the parties shall cooperate to amend this Agreement with the goal of giving Executive the economic benefits described herein in a manner that does not result in such tax being imposed.

13. Gross-Up Payments.

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Agreement) (a “Payment”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes but excluding any taxes or interest imposed by Section 409A of the Code), the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. This provision is intended to override the cut-back provisions of Section 7.7 of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, if it is determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed by $25,000 the greatest amount that could be paid 

6

* * *

  


to the Executive such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any excise tax (the “Reduced Amount”), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 13(c) below, all determinations required to be made under this Section 13, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made a certified public accounting firm designated by the Board (the “Accounting Firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive. If the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control Event, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

(c) If the Executive is, or could be, entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment, pursuant to Section 13(a) the Executive shall take any position requested by the Company (a “Requested Position”) on the Executive’s federal income tax returns with respect to the treatment of the Payment from the Company, any Gross-Up Payment, the payment of any Indemnified Amount (as defined below), and the receipt of any refund or interest paid by the government to the Executive as a result of a Contest (as defined below), provided that: (i) the Company shall provide the Executive with an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm that there is “substantial authority” for the Requested Position within the meaning of Code Section 6662; and (ii) the general long term or senior unsecured corporate credit rating of the Company or its successor is at least BBB- as rated by Standard & Poors and Baa3 as rated by Moody’s Investor Services at the time the Executive would be required to take a Requested Position or the Company places in an escrow account or otherwise provides security reasonably requested by Executive to ensure payment to the Executive of the indemnity amount that could become due to the Executive pursuant to the following sentence. The Company shall indemnify the Executive for any tax, penalty and interest incurred by him as a result of taking the Requested Position. The amount for which the Executive is indemnified under the preceding sentence (the “Indemnified Amount”) shall be computed on an after-tax basis, taking into account any income, Excise or other taxes, including interest and penalties. The Executive shall keep the Company informed of all developments in any audit with respect to a Requested Position. Upon payment of the Indemnified Amount, or (if the Indemnified Amount is not yet payable) upon the Company’s written affirmation, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, of the Company’s obligation to indemnify the Executive with respect to the Requested Position, and provided part (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 13(c) is satisfied at such time, the Company shall be entitled, at its sole expense, to control the contest of any disallowance or proposed disallowance of a Requested Position (a “Contest”), and the Executive agrees to cooperate in connection with a Contest, including, without limitation, executing powers of attorney and other documents at the reasonable request of the Company. The Indemnified Amount shall be payable whenever an amount is payable to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the disallowance of a Requested Position. Following payment by the Company of the Indemnified Amount, if the Requested Position is sustained by the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, the Company shall be entitled to any resulting receipt of interest or refund of taxes, interest and penalties that were properly attributable to the Indemnified Amount. If a Requested 

7

* * *

  


Position is sustained in whole or in part in a final resolution of a Contest, and if the Indemnified Amount therefore exceeds the amount of taxes, penalties and interest payable by the Executive as a result of the Requested Position (determined on an after-tax basis after taking into account payments made pursuant to the preceding sentence and this sentence), any such excess portion of the Indemnified Amount shall be treated as a loan by the Company to the Executive, which loan the Executive must repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Code Section 7872(f)(2).
