In the event of any change in the Common Stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any rights offering to purchase Common Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or of any similar change affecting the Common Stock, the number and kind of shares with respect to which the Award has been granted shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to Recipient hereunder. Any adjustment so made shall be final and binding upon Recipient.

(f) Recipient Has No Rights as a Stockholder. Recipient shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to Recipient.

(h) Compliance with Law and Regulations. This Award and the obligation of the Company to deliver shares hereunder, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Common Stock prior to (i) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed, and (ii) the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

(i) Cancellation of Award. The Committee may, with the consent of the Recipient, from time to time cancel all or any portion of this Award, and the Company's obligation in respect of such Award may be discharged either by (i) payment to the Recipient of an amount in cash equal to the fair market value at such time of the shares subject to the portion of the Award so cancelled, (ii) the issuance or transfer to the Recipient of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the number of shares subject to the portion of the Award so cancelled, or (iii) a combination of cash and shares as described above, all as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

(j) Designation of Beneficiary. Recipient may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries hereunder (the "Beneficiary" and may from time to time revoke or change any such designation. Any designation of Beneficiary shall be controlling over any other disposition, testamentary or otherwise; provided, however, that if the Committee shall be in doubt as to the entitlement of any such Beneficiary to any rights hereunder, the Committee may determine to recognize only the legal representative of Recipient, in which case the Company, the Committee and the members thereof shall not be under any further liability to anyone.

3\. Recipient Bound by Plan. Recipient hereby acknowledges that the Company has made a copy of the Plan available to him or her and Recipient agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.

4\. Withholding of Taxes. Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any social security tax obligation (the “Tax Withholding Obligation”), the Recipient must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. The Recipient's acceptance of this Award constitutes his or her instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on the Recipient's behalf a whole number of Shares from those Shares issuable to the Recipient as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Such Shares wil l be sold on the day the Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., the Vesting Date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. The Recipient will be responsible for all broker’s fees and other costs of sale, and he or she agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Recipient's Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to the Recipient through payroll or otherwise as soon as practicable. The Recipient acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Recipient's Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligati on that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above. 

6\. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company shall be addressed to it at its offices, P.O. Box 300, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-0300, Attention: Stock Plan Administrator, and any notice hereunder to the Recipient shall be addressed to him or her at his or her address as shown on the Company's records, subject to the right of either party to designate at any time hereafter in writing some other address.
