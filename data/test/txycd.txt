Exhibit 10.1 



This AGREEMENT, dated April 25, 2006, is between ZymoGenetics, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Company”) and Vaughn B. Himes (“Executive”). 

1\. Employment. Company will employ Executive and Executive will accept employment as Senior Vice President, Technical Operations, of the Company. Executive accepts employment upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and for the period (hereinafter called the “Term of Employment”) specified in Section 3 below. 

2\. Duties. Executive shall, during the Term of Employment, serve the Company under the direction of the President of the Company. Executive shall perform the duties of his position faithfully, diligently and competently and to the best of his ability, and shall devote his full business time to his employment. Executive shall perform such other duties as are assigned to him by the President or the Board of Directors of the Company. Executive may devote reasonable periods of time to (a) engaging in personal investment activities, (b) serving on the Board of Directors of other corporations with the consent of the Compensation Committee of the Board, if such service would not otherwise be prohibited by Section 7 hereof, and (c) engaging in charitable or community service activities, so long as none of the foregoing additional activities materially interfere with Executive’s duties under this Agreement. 

3\. Term of Employment; Termination. 

Executive’s Term of Employment shall be two years from the date of this Agreement, unless extended or earlier terminated as provided below. 

(a) Termination or Extension of Term of Employment By Company 

The Company shall employ Executive, for a period commencing on the date hereof and terminating as follows: 

(i) Two years from the date hereof, if at least thirty (30) days prior to such date either the Company or Executive has, at its election, notified the other in writing that this Agreement shall terminate on such date. If notice of termination is not given, this Agreement shall be deemed to extend from year to year. It can then be terminated by written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the annual renewal date. 

(ii) With or without “Cause” (as defined below), Company may terminate the employment of Executive at any time upon giving “Notice of Termination” (as defined below). 

* * *

(b) By Executive 

Executive may terminate his employment at any time, for any reason, upon giving Notice of Termination. 

(c) Automatic Termination 

This Agreement and Executive’s employment hereunder shall terminate automatically upon the death or total disability of Executive. The term “total disability” as used herein shall mean Executive’s inability to perform the duties set forth in paragraph 1 hereof for a period or periods aggregating ninety (90) calendar days in any 12-month period as a result of physical or mental illness, loss of legal capacity or any other cause beyond Executive’s control, unless Executive is granted a leave of absence by the Board of Directors of Company. Executive and Company hereby acknowledge that Executive’s ability to perform the duties specified in paragraph 2 hereof is of the essence of this Agreement. Termination hereunder shall be deemed to be effective (a) at the end of the calendar month in which Executive’s death occurs or (b) immediately upon a determination by the Board of Directors of Company of Executive’s total disability, as defined herein. 

(d) Notice 

The term “Notice of Termination” shall mean at least thirty (30) days’ written notice of termination, by either party, of Executive’s employment, during which period Executive’s employment and performance of services will continue; provided, however, that Company may, upon notice to Executive and without reducing Executive’s compensation during such period, excuse Executive from any or all of his duties during such period. Such a reduction in duties shall not constitute “good reason” for voluntary termination so as to trigger termination payments in accordance with subparagraph 4.2. The effective date of the termination (the “Termination Date”) of Executive’s employment hereunder shall be the date on which such 30-day period expires. 

4\. Termination Payments 

In the event of termination of the employment of Executive, all compensation and benefits set forth in this Agreement shall terminate except as specifically provided in this paragraph 4: 

4.1 Termination by Company 

(a) Upon termination by Company, Company shall pay Executive any unpaid annual base salary which has accrued for services already performed as of the Termination Date.

* * *

(b) If Company terminates Executive’s employment without Cause, as defined below, Executive shall be entitled to receive termination payments equal to twelve (12) months annual base salary. The termination payments shall be calculated according to Executive’s base salary as of the date of Notice of Termination and the termination payments will be paid semi-monthly in equal parts in accordance with the same time schedule that Company or a “Successor Company” (as defined in the Stock Option Agreement and incorporated by reference herein) makes its customary payroll. Company or a Successor Company may deduct customary withholdings including social security, federal and state income taxes, and state disability insurance from these severance payments; however, any and all such obligations shall be Executive’s responsibility. Company will issue and file appropriate Form 1099 or similar tax documents in connection with any termination payments. The termination payments described in this paragraph are expressly contingent upon Executive’s full compliance with the terms of his Employee Inventions and Proprietary Information Agreement with Company (the “Inventions Agreement”), a copy of which is attached hereto. In the event Executive were to materially breach this Inventions Agreement, his right to any termination payments under this paragraph shall be extinguished, Company (and any Successor Company) shall cease payments, and Executive shall immediately return to Company or to any Successor Company any severance payments already made. If Executive is terminated by either Company or any Successor Company for Cause, Executive shall not be entitled to receive any of the foregoing benefits, other than those set forth in clause (a) above. 

4.2 Termination by Executive 

In the case of the termination of Executive’s employment by Executive for “good reason,” as defined below, Executive shall be entitled to the termination payments as set forth in clauses 4.1(a) and (b). In the case of termination of Executive’s employment by Executive for any other reason, Executive shall not be entitled to any termination payments or accelerated vesting benefit, other than as set forth in clause 4.1(a), above. 

4.3 Termination as a Result of Death or Total Disability 

In the event of termination of Executive’s employment pursuant to subparagraph 3(c), Executive or his estate shall be paid the compensation set forth in clause 4.1(a) and shall not be entitled to any of the benefits under clauses 4.1(b). 

4.4 “Good Reason” 

“Good reason” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events, without the consent of the Executive: 

a)

a demotion or other material reduction in the nature or status of Executive’s responsibilities; provided, however, that a change in the person or office to   
  
-3- 

* * *

which Executive reports, without a corresponding reduction in duties, status and responsibilities, shall not constitute “good reason;”   
  
b) a non-voluntary reduction in the Executive’s annual base salary;   
  
c) requirement by a Successor Company that the Executive relocate his principal place of employment to a location that is more than 50 miles from the principal place of employment where Executive was employed; or

e) following a Change in Control (as defined in subsection 4.6 hereof), the Executive ceases to hold the position of Senior Vice President, Technical Operations of the parent or combined entity resulting from such Change in Control; or   
  
f) even if there is no Change in Control, but the Company enters into a merger, partnership or similar transaction, which results in a person other than the Executive becoming Senior Vice President, Technical Operations of the new combined entity.   
  
4.5 Cause

a) willful misconduct, insubordination, or dishonesty in the performance of Executive’s duties or other knowing and material violation of Company’s or a Successor Company’s policies and procedures in effect from time to time which results in a material adverse effect on Company or a Successor Company;   
  
b) willful actions (or intentional failures to act) in bad faith by Executive with respect to Company or a Successor Company that materially impair Company’s or a Successor Company’s business, goodwill or reputation;   
  
c) conviction of Executive of a felony involving an act of dishonesty, moral turpitude, deceit or fraud, or the commission of acts that could reasonably be expected to result in such a conviction; or   
  
d) any material violation by Executive of Executive’s Inventions Agreement with Company.
