5\. Exercise. The Optionee shall not be entitled to exercise the Option until it is vested. Subject to the provisions of Section 3, the Option may be exercised only while the Optionee is employed by the Company or an Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Company.

accompanied by payment in full of the Option price for such shares of Common Stock, such payment to be made in (i) cash, as described in Section 8(c) of the Plan; (ii) subject to Section 8(c) of the Plan, that number of Mature Shares of unrestricted Common Stock, or vested Restricted Stock, which has an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price for all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such exercise; (iii) a combination of methods (i) and (ii); or (iv) other means authorized by the Committee in accordance with Section 8(c) of the Plan. If the tender of shares of Common Stock as payment of the Option price would result in the issuance of fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company shall instead return the balance in cash or by check to the Optionee. If the Option is exercised by any person or persons other than the Optionee, the notice described in this Section 7(a) shall be accompanied by appropriate proof (as determined by the Committee) of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option under the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. The Company shall issue and deliver, in the name of the person or persons exercising the Option, a certificate or certificates representing such shares as soon as practicable after notice and payment are received and the exercise is approved. 

(b) The Option may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement with respect to any whole number of shares subject to the Option, but in no event may an Option be exercised as to fewer than one hundred (100) shares at any one time, or the remaining shares covered by the Option if less than two hundred (200).  
(c) The Optionee shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock to be acquired by the exercise of the Option until the date of issuance of a certificate or certificates representing such shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued. All shares of Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.  
(d) The Optionee agrees that no later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in his gross income for federal income tax purposes with respect to the Option, the Optionee shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Withholding obligations may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is acquired upon exercise of the Option. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement and the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Employee.  
  
8\. Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company and the terms of the Plan, if, during the terms of this Agreement, there shall be any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or
