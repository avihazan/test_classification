Within 30 days after the date of Closing (the “Filing Date”), the Company shall cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 or, to the extent that Form S-3 is not available, Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”), which Registration Statement shall provide for the resale of the Registrable Securities. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as possible after the filing thereof and shall continuously maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until the earlier of (a) the date on which all Registrable Securities that could be issuable or issued upon conversion or exercise of the Warrants have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement or (b) five years from the date hereof. Such Registration Statement will permit the Holders to resell the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. 

1.3 Obligations of the Company. In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be required to: 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement (and the applicable 1934 Act reports incorporated therein by reference, so filed on a timely basis) as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement current, effective and free from any material misstatement or omission to state a material fact for the period commencing on the Filing Date and ending on the date that is the earlier of (a) the date on which all Registrable Securities that could be issuable or issued upon conversion or exercise of the Warrants have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement or (b) five years from the date hereof; 

(b) furnish to any Holder with respect to the Registrable Securities registered under the Registration Statement such number of copies of the Registration Statement, prospectuses and preliminary prospectuses in conformity with the requirements of the Act and such other documents as the Holder may reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of all or any of the Registrable Securities by the Holder; 

(c) use its best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be requested by the Holders, provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any state or jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or has not consented; 

2 

* * *

(d) in the event of any underwritten public offering (only if applicable), enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering; 

(e) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and at the request of any such Holder, prepare and furnish to such Holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such shares, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete in the light of the circumstances then existing; 

(f) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section 1 to be listed on each securities exchange and trading system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed; 

(g) promptly notify each Holder after it receives notice of the time when the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, or when a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed with the SEC; 

(h) promptly notify each Holder after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC delaying or suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for that purpose, and it will promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order should be issued; 

(i) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC under the Act and the 1934 Act, including without limitation, Rule 172 under the Act, file any final prospectus, including any supplement or amendment thereof, with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, promptly inform the Holders in writing if, at any time during the period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172 and, as a result thereof, the Holders are required to make available a prospectus in connection with any disposition of the Registrable Securities and take such other actions as may be necessary to facilitate the registration of the Registrable Securities hereunder; 

(j) refrain from, during the period from the date hereof until the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, publicly announcing or preparing and filing with the SEC any other registration statement, other than registrations on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms thereof;

* * *

(l) cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and under law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holders may reasonably request. 

1.4 Information from Holder. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 1 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder’s Registrable Securities. 

1.5 Expenses of Registration. All expenses incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections 1.2 and 1.3, including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers’ and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the selling Holders shall be borne by the Company. 

1.6 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in the Registration Statement under this Section 1: 

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the partners, officers, directors and stockholders of each Holder, legal counsel and accountants for each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a “Violation”): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in such Registration Statement a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, underwriter, controlling person or other aforementioned person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection l.6(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information 

4 

* * *

furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such Holder, underwriter, controlling person or other aforementioned person; provided further, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter, or any person controlling such underwriter, from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased shares in the offering, if a copy of the most current prospectus was not sent or given by or on behalf of such underwriter to such person, if required by law to have been so delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the shares to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. 

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the Registration Statement, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such Registration Statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection l.6(b) for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection l.6(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and provided that in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection l.6(b) exceed the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of such Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 1.6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 1.6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party 

5 

* * *

under this Section 1.6 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission to so deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 1.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action without the full and complete release of all the indemnified parties. 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 1.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no contribution by any Holder, when combined with any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 1.6(b), shall exceed the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of such Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 

(e) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 1.6 shall survive the completion of any resales or dispositions of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement under this Section 1 and otherwise. 

1.7 Reports Under the 1934 Act. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company agrees to: 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times on and after the date hereof; 

(b) take such action as is necessary to enable the Holders to utilize Form S-3 for the sale of their Registrable Securities; 

(c) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Act and the 1934 Act; and 

(d) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Act and the 1934 Act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the 

6 

* * *

Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to avail any Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form. 

1.8 Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 1 may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such securities that is a subsidiary, parent, partner, limited partner, retired partner or stockholder or affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) of a Holder (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or the like) provided: (a) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (b) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

1.9 Termination of Registration Rights.
