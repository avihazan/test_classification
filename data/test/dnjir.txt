NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Buyer hereby agree as follows:

e. “Registration Statement” means any registration statement of the Company, as amended when it became effective, including all documents filed as part thereof or incorporated by reference therein, and including any information contained in a Prospectus subsequently filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act or deemed to be a part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B or 462(b) of the 1933 Act, covering the sale of the Registrable Securities.

f. “Shelf Registration Statement” means the Company’s existing registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-162609).

2\. REGISTRATION.

a. Mandatory Registration. The Company shall within two (2) Business Days from the date hereof file with the SEC a prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement specifically relating to the Registrable Securities (the “Prospectus Supplement”). The Buyer and its counsel have had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such Prospectus Supplement prior to its filing with the SEC. Buyer shall furnish all information reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion therein. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the 1933 Act and available for sales of all of the Registrable Securities at all times until the earlier of (i) the date as of which the Buyer may sell all of the Registrable Securities without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act (or successor thereto), (ii) the date on which (A) the Company shall have sold all the Registrable Securities and no Available Amount remains under the Purchase Agreement, or (iii) the date on which the Purchase Agreement is terminated (the “Registration Period”). The Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

b. Rule 424 Prospectus. The Company shall, as required by applicable securities regulations, from time to time file with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 Act, a prospectus, including any amendments or supplements thereto, to be used in connection with sales of the Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement. The Buyer and its counsel shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such prospectus prior to its filing with the SEC. The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to comment upon such prospectus within one (1) Business Day from the date the Buyer receives the final version of such prospectus.

2  
  
c. Sufficient Number of Shares Registered. In the event the number of shares available under the Shelf Registration Statement is insufficient to cover the Registrable Securities, the Company shall, to the extent necessary and permissible, amend the Registration Statement or file a new registration statement (a “New Registration Statement”), so as to cover all of such Registrable Securities as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than twenty (20) Business Days after the necessity therefor arises. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment and/or New Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof.

3\. RELATED OBLIGATIONS.

With respect to the Registration Statement and whenever any Registrable Securities are to be registered pursuant to Sections 2(a) and (c), including on the Shelf Registration Statement or on any New Registration Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, the Company shall have the following obligations:

a. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement and any New Registration Statement and any Prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement, as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement or any New Registration Statement effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by the Shelf Registration Statement or any New Registration Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement.

b. The Company shall submit to the Buyer for review and comment any disclosure in the Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto containing information provided by the Buyer for inclusion in such document and any descriptions or disclosure regarding the Buyer, the Purchase Agreement, including the transaction contemplated thereby, or this Agreement at least two (2) Business Days prior to their filing with the SEC, and not file any document in a form to which Buyer reasonably and timely objects. Upon request of the Buyer, the Company shall provide to the Buyer all disclosure in the Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (other than prospectus supplements that consist only of a copy of a filed Form 10-Q) at least two (2) Business Days prior to their filing with the SEC, and not file any document in a form to which Buyer reasonably and timely objects. The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to comment upon the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto within two (2) Business Days from the date the Buyer receives the final version thereof. The Company shall furnish to the Buyer, without charge, any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives relating to the Shelf Registration Statement or any New Registration Statement.

c. Upon request of the Buyer, the Company shall furnish to the Buyer, (i) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, at least one copy of the Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including all financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits, (ii) upon the effectiveness of any amendment(s) to a Registration Statement, a copy of the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (or such other number of copies as the Buyer may reasonably request) and (iii) such other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final prospectus, as the Buyer may reasonably request from time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by the Buyer.

3  
  
d. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) register and qualify, unless an exemption from registration and qualification is available, the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under such other securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Buyer reasonably requests, (ii) prepare and file in those jurisdictions, such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (y) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (z) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company shall promptly notify the Buyer who holds Registrable Securities of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

e. As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event or facts, the Company shall notify the Buyer in writing if the Company has determined that the Prospectus included in any Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and, upon the Buyer’s request, deliver a copy of such supplement or amendment to the Buyer. In providing this notice to the Buyer, the Company shall not include any other information about the facts underlying the Company’s determination and shall not in any way communicate any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock to the Buyer. The Company shall also promptly notify the Buyer in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to the Buyer by facsimile or e-mail on the same day of such effectiveness), (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to any Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information, and (iii) of the Company’s reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.

f. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest practicable time and to notify the Buyer of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

4  
  
g. The Company shall (i) cause all the Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (ii) secure designation and quotation of all the Registrable Securities on the Principal Market (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement). The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section.

h. The Company shall cooperate with the Buyer to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legend) representing the Registrable Securities to be offered pursuant to any Registration Statement and enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts as the Buyer may reasonably request and registered in such names as the Buyer may request.

i. The Company shall at all times provide a transfer agent and registrar with respect to its Common Stock.

j. If reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Company shall (i) promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the Buyer believes should be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities; (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement.

k. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

l. If reasonably requested by the Buyer at any time, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a written confirmation of whether or not the effectiveness of a Registration Statement has lapsed at any time for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) and whether or not the Registration Statement is current and available to the Company for sale of all of the Registrable Securities.

m. The Company agrees to take all other reasonable actions as necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by the Buyer of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement.

5  
  
4\. OBLIGATIONS OF THE BUYER.

a. The Buyer has furnished to the Company in Exhibit A hereto such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it as required to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. The Company shall notify the Buyer in writing of any other information the Company reasonably requires from the Buyer in connection with any Registration Statement hereunder. The Buyer will promptly notify the Company of any material change in the information set forth in Exhibit A, other than changes in its ownership of the Common Stock.

b. The Buyer agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any amendments and supplements to any Registration Statement hereunder.

All reasonable expenses, other than sales or brokerage commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, shall be paid by the Company.

6\. INDEMNIFICATION.

a. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Buyer, each Person, if any, who controls the Buyer, the members, the directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives of the Buyer and each Person, if any, who controls the Buyer within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”) (each, an “Indemnified Person”), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, attorneys’ fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, (collectively, “Claims”) incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto (“Indemnified Damages”), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in the Registration Statement, any New Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered (“Blue Sky Filing”), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the final Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or any New Registration Statement, or (iv) any material violation by the Company of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being, collectively, “Violations”). The Company shall reimburse each Indemnified Person promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim by an Indemnified Person arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, any New Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company; (ii) with respect to any superceded prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any such person from whom the person asserting any such Claim purchased the Registrable Securities that are the subject thereof (or to the benefit of any person controlling such person) if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the superceded prospectus was corrected in the revised prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, if such revised prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(c) or Section 3(e), and the Indemnified Person was promptly advised in writing not to use the incorrect prospectus prior to the use giving rise to a violation and such Indemnified Person, notwithstanding such advice, used it; (iii) shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Buyer to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by the Company, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(c) or Section 3(e); and (iv) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Buyer pursuant to Section 9.

6  
  
b. In connection with the Registration Statement, any New Registration Statement or Prospectus, the Buyer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement or signs any New Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (collectively and together with an Indemnified Person, an “Indemnified Party”), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information about the Buyer set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto or updated from time to time in writing by the Buyer and furnished to the Company by the Buyer expressly for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any New Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 6(d), the Buyer will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Buyer pursuant to Section 9.

7  
  
c. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

d. The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred.

e. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.

7\. CONTRIBUTION.

To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.

8  
  
8\. ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

The Company shall not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Buyer. The Buyer may not assign its rights under this Agreement without the written consent of the Company.

9\. AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the Company and the Buyer.

10\. MISCELLANEOUS.

a. Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of transmission is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party); or (iii) one (1) Business Day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the same.
