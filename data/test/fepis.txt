If Executive fails to cure within such period, Executive shall be terminated, effective the date written notice of failure to cure is given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such acts involve fraudulent conduct or moral turpitude, no opportunity to cure shall exist and the date of termination of employment by the Company under this subsection 4.1 shall be the date set forth in the written notice of termination delivered by the Company to Executive, unless no such date is specified in such notice, in which case the date of termination shall be the date of receipt by Executive of written notice of termination and such notice shall provide specific details of the fraudulent conduct and/or moral turpitude. 

4.2. Death.

4.3. Disability. If Executive becomes Permanently Disabled (as defined below) prior to the expiration of the Term, this Agreement may be terminated by agreement of the majority of the Board as of the date of such disability. In the event of such termination, Executive shall be entitled to receive such hourly fees, and other compensation and disbursement of benefits as would have been payable to Executive under a termination for Cause under subsection 4.1 as of the date on which Executive became Permanently Disabled as defined below.
