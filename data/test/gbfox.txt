Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason by either party as described in this Section 4, Executive shall be entitled to receive payment of (a) any unpaid Base Salary through the Completion Date payable on such date; (b) any unused vacation and paid time off accrued through the Completion Date payable on such date; and (c) applicable employee benefits to which Executive is entitled upon the cessation of employment with the Company, in accordance with the terms of the plans or programs of the Company then in effect (a-c referred to together herein as “Accrued Benefits”). In addition to the Accrued Benefits, and subject to Executive’s execution of a customary and reasonable release of liabilities in favor of the Company, the following shall apply: 

4.4.1 Involuntary Termination. In the event of termination of Executive’s employment by the Company without cause pursuant to Section 4.2.3 or by Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4.3.1, then, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4.2 below, in addition to the Accrued Benefits described in Section 4.4, Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum severance payment on the Completion Date, equal to three (3) times the average of Executive’s highest two (2) years out of the prior (5) years of total annual compensation, including the following: (a) Base Salary, (b) bonuses and incentive compensation, (c) the fair value of any stock, options or other equity grants whether or not vested, and (d) the annualized value of all benefits and perquisites, including without limitation those provided under Sections 3.4 and 3.5 (the “Severance Payment”).

4.4.2 Change in Control. Within ninety (90) days prior to, or twelve (12) months after, a Change of Control, if there is either (A) a termination of this Agreement by the Company without cause pursuant to Section 4.2.3, or (B) a termination of this Agreement by Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4.3.1, then the Severance Payment shall be subject to mitigation as provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 Q&A; 42(c)(5), or, in lieu of the Severance Payment provided under Section 4.4.1, the Executive, in his complete and sole discretion, may elect to receive an alternative severance payment (the “Alternative Payment”), not subject to mitigation, payable at the same time the Severance Payment would otherwise have been paid. Executive must give written notice to Company of such election: (i) within fifteen (15) days prior to the end of the Executive Notice Period after resignation with Good Reason; or (ii) within fifteen (15) days prior to the end of the Notice Period after termination by Company without cause (each, an “Alternative Payment Notice”). For purposes of this Agreement, the “Alternative Payment” shall be a lump sum payment made by Company to Executive in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the product of 2.99 (or, if Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) is amended providing for a safe harbor multiple other than 3, then the multiple as amended, less 0.01) multiplied by Executive’s “base amount” (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)); provided, however, that the amount of the Alternative Payment shall be reduced by the value of acceleration (as determined under Code Section 280G and the 

4 

* * *

regulations thereunder) of any equity, stock options or deferred compensation accelerated by reason of termination to the extent required to be included in the Executive’s “base amount” pursuant to Code Section 280G. The value (as determined under Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) of acceleration of vesting of equity, stock options or deferred compensation shall be taken into account to the minimum extent necessary so as not to violate Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 Q&A; 42(c). 

4.4.3 Definition of Change in Control. “Change in Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events during the Term of the Agreement: (i) any sale, lease, license, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation of the Company and the Company is not the surviving entity; (iii) a reorganization or liquidation of the Company; (iv) a merger, consolidation, tender offer or any other transaction involving the Company if the equity holders of the Company immediately before such merger, consolidation, tender offer or other transaction do not own, directly or indirectly, immediately following such merger, consolidation, tender offer or other transaction, more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the entity resulting from such merger, consolidation, tender offer or other transaction; (v) a change in the composition of the Company’s Board as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors; or (vi) the consummation of any other transaction involving a significant issuance of the Company’s securities, or other material event, that the Company’s Board determines to be a Change in Control. The term “Incumbent Directors” shall mean directors who either: (A) are directors of the Company as of the Effective Date hereof; or (B) are nominated for election to the Board of the Company with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the directors of the Company who are Incumbent Directors (“Approved Successors”) described in (A) above at the time of such nomination; or (C) are nominated for election to the Board of the Company with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the directors of the Company who are Incumbent Directors or their Approved Successors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Incumbent Directors” shall not include an individual whose election or nomination is in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors to the Company. 

4.4.4 Timing of Payments. Subject to Section 8.12, payments upon termination under this Section 4.4 shall be made in a single lump-sum cash payment, less appropriate deductions and withholding, on the Completion Date or the Executive’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A (as such term is defined in Section 8.12) if such separation from service occurs after the Completion Date. The Company’s liability for wages and benefits upon termination of this Agreement is limited to the obligations set forth herein. 

5\. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; NON-SOLICIT. 

5.1 Executive acknowledges that his work for the Company will bring him into close contact with many confidential affairs of the Company not readily available to the public, and hereby agrees that he will not at any time (both during the Term and thereafter) disclose to any person, including any legal entity (except the Company and its Affiliates), any Confidential Information, and will only use Confidential Information for the Company’s benefit; provided, however, that Executive may use and disclose Confidential Information to the extent necessary to assert any right or defend against any claim arising under this Agreement or pertaining to Confidential Information or its use, to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable statute, constitution, treaty, rule, regulation, ordinance or order, or if Executive receives a request to disclose all or any part of the information contained in the Confidential Information

Nothing herein shall prevent Executive from, at some point in the future, working for an entity which may also employ former employees of the Company. 

6\. GRANT OF RIGHTS. 

6.1 Executive hereby grants, transfers, conveys and assigns to the Company, its successors and assigns, all right, title, and interest in and to all work, materials and intellectual property of any and all forms constituting or otherwise relating to his performance of his duties hereunder, including the copyright, patent, trade secret rights, and all other right, title, and interest therein, and consisting of all source code, object code, documentation, flow charts, design documents, and record and file layouts relating thereto, and all trademarks, service marks, logos and trade dress associated therewith, and any discovery, concept or idea, whether or not patentable, made during such performance including, but not limited to, processes, methods, formulae and techniques, improvements thereof and know-how relating thereto (collectively, the “Property”).

6.2 In furtherance of, and not in contravention, limitation and/or in place of, the provisions of Section 6.1 above, Company hereby notifies Executive of California Labor Code Section 2870, which provides: 

6.2.1 “(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. 

6.2.2 (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.” 

6.3 Executive acknowledges that he has been notified by the Company of this law, and understands that this Agreement does not apply to Property which is otherwise fully protected under the provisions of said Labor Code Section 2870. Therefore, Executive agrees to promptly disclose in writing to the Company all Property, whether or not Executive personally considers it patentable, which Executive alone, or with others, conceives or makes during his employment with Company or as is otherwise required and set forth under this Section 6.2. Company shall hold said information in strict confidence to determine the applicability of California Labor Code Section 2870 to said Property and, to the extent said Section 2870 does not apply, Executive hereby assigns and agrees to assign all his right, title and interest in and to the Property which relates to business of the Company and Executive agrees not to disclose any of such Property to others without the prior written express consent of Company. Executive agrees to notify Company in writing prior to making any disclosure or performing any work during the term of his employment with Company which may conflict with any proprietary rights or technical know-how claimed by Executive as his property. In the event Executive fails to give Company notice of such conflict, Executive agrees that Executive shall have no further right or claim with respect to any such conflicting proprietary rights or technical know-how. 

7\. EQUITABLE REMEDIES. The parties hereto intend that the covenants contained in Sections 5 and 6 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws of the State of California. Executive acknowledges and agrees that his breach of any provision of Sections 5 and 6 will result in irreparable harm and injury to the Company, and further acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any such breach it would be extremely difficult to fix or assess actual damages resulting therefrom. In addition to any other remedy that may be available to the Company at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to a decree of specific performance and to a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining and restricting the breach, or a threatened breach, by Executive of any such provision of this Agreement.

8.12.2 All expense reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement to the extent required under Code Section 409A shall be subject to the following Company policy: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, allowances or in-kind benefits provided during one calendar year may not affect the benefits provided during any other year; (ii) reimbursements shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the Executive incurs such expenses, and the Executive shall take all actions necessary to claim all such reimbursements on a timely basis to permit the Company to make all such reimbursement payments prior to the end of said period, and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
