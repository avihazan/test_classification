STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

  


General Terms and Conditions

  


Section 1\. Option Size and Type. The number of shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (“Shares”) that have been optioned to you is specified in this Stock Option Agreement. If the “Option Type” shown for your Options is “ISO”, then your Options have been designed with the intent that they qualify to the maximum permissible extent for the special tax benefits applicable to incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the “Option Type” shown for your Options is “NQSO” or is blank, incentive stock option tax treatment is not applicable.

  


Section 2\. Exercise Price. The Exercise Price for your Options is the price per Share at which you may acquire the Shares that have been optioned to you and is specified in this Stock Option Agreement. As a general rule, the Exercise Price for your Option will not change unless there is a stock split, stock dividend, merger or other major corporate event that justifies an adjustment under section 9.3 of the Plan.

  


Section 3\. Vesting.

  


(a) Earliest Exercise Date. You may not exercise your Options until they are vested. The date on which your Options become vested is specified in this Stock Option Agreement as the Earliest Exercise Date. As a general rule, you must be in the service of the Company on an Earliest Exercise Date in order to be vested in the Options that vest on that date. You may acquire the Shares that have been optioned to you by exercising your Options at any time during the period beginning on the Earliest Exercise Date and continuing throughout the Exercise Period. You may exercise vested Options by completing and filing the Notice of Exercise of Stock Option that is attached to this Stock Option Agreement as Appendix A and by following the procedures outlined therein or by following procedures specified by the Company.

  


(b) Forfeitures. If you terminate service with the Company prior to an Earliest Exercise Date, you will forfeit any Options that are scheduled to vest on that date. When you forfeit Options, you relinquish any and all rights that you have to acquire the Options.

(c) Accelerated Vesting. All of your outstanding Options that have not previously vested and that are scheduled to vest during the six-month period beginning on the date of your termination of service due to your death or Disability, will become fully and immediately vested on the date of your termination due to your death or Disability, without any further action on your part. In addition, an outstanding option that has not been forfeited on the date on which a Change in Control occurs shall, on such date, be 100% vested. In addition, in the event of your termination that is not a Termination for Cause or in the event of your resignation with “Good Reason” (as defined below), an outstanding Option that has not been forfeited will be 100% vested on the date your service with your Employer terminates. If vesting accelerates, the accelerated vesting date will be the applicable Earliest Exercise Date. You may designate a beneficiary to inherit your rights to any vested, unexercised Options that are outstanding to you at your death using the Beneficiary Designation attached as Appendix B. You will be considered to have “Good Reason” for a voluntary resignation if: the effective date of resignation occurs within ninety (90) days after any of the following: (a) the failure of the Board of Directors to appoint or re-appoint or elect or re-elect you to your position(s) with your Employer; (b) the failure of the stockholders of your Employer to elect or re-elect you or the failure of the Board of Directors (or the nominating committee thereof) to nominate you for such election or re-election; (c) a material failure by your Employer, whether by amendment of its charter, or by-laws, action of the Board of Directors or the Employer’s stockholders or otherwise, to vest you in the functions, duties, or responsibilities prescribed in an employment or retention agreement; provided that you shall have given notice of such material adverse effect to your Employer, and your Employer has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; (d) any reduction of your rate of base salary in effect from time to time; provided that you shall have given notice of such material adverse effect to your Employer, and your Employer has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; (e) any change in the terms and conditions of any compensation or benefit program in which you participate which, either individually or together with other changes, has a material adverse effect on the aggregate value of your total compensation package; provided that you shall have given notice of such material adverse effect to the your Employer, and your Employer has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; (f) any material breach by your Employer of any term, condition or covenant contained in an employment or retention agreement; provided that you shall have given notice of such material breach to your Employer, and your Employer has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given.

(d) Definition of Service. For purposes of determining the vesting of your Options, you will be deemed to be in the service of the Company for so long as you serve in any capacity as a common-law employee, non-employee director or consultant of the Company or the Bank.

  


Section 4\. Exercise Period.

  


(a) General. You will have the right to purchase all or any portion of your Option at any time during the period (“Exercise Period”) beginning on the applicable Earliest Exercise Date and ending on the earliest to occur of the following dates:

  


(i) the Option Expiration Date specified in this Stock Option Agreement;

  


(ii) the date and time of your termination of service with the Company due to (A) a voluntary resignation that is in anticipation of a Termination for Cause or (B) a discharge that is a Termination for Cause;

  


(iii) the last day of the ten-year period commencing on the date on which the Option was granted.  


  


(b)  ISOs. To qualify for the favorable tax treatment accorded to incentive stock options, you must exercise any Options that are designated as ISOs within three months after you terminate service as a common-law employee of the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason other than death or Disability, within one year after you terminate service as a common-law employee due to your Disability or death. If they are exercised later, they will be subject to tax as if they were designated as NQSOs.

  


Section 5\. No Right to Continued Service. Nothing in this Stock Option Agreement or any action of the Board or Committee with respect to this Stock Option Agreement shall be held or construed to confer upon you any right to a continuation of service by the Company. You may be dismissed or otherwise dealt with as though this Stock Option Agreement had not been entered into.

  


Section 6\. Taxes. Where any person is entitled to receive Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option granted hereunder, the Company shall have the right to require such person to pay to the Company the amount of any tax which the Company is required to withhold with respect to such shares, or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or to sell without notice, a sufficient number of Shares to cover the amount required to be withheld.
