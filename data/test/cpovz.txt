TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RSU AWARD: 

1\. Grant. Effective on the Grant Date, you have been granted the number of shares indicated above of RSUs providing you the right to receive Common Stock of ViaSat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), as the RSU vests, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan. 

2\. Forfeiture Upon Termination. Until vested, the RSU shall be subject to forfeiture in the event of the termination of your employment or service (as applicable) with the Company and all of its Subsidiaries for any reason, whether such termination is occasioned by you, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without cause or by mutual agreement (“Termination of Employment”). Termination of Employment means the Company has determined that you have stopped providing services to the Company Group (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., active services would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing services for purposes of your RSU grant (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on an approved leave of absence). 

3\. Transferability. Until vested, the RSU or any right or interest therein is not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Until Common Stock is issued upon settlement of the RSU, you will not be deemed for any purpose to be, or have rights as, a Company shareholder by virtue of this award. You are not entitled to vote any shares of Common Stock by virtue of this award. 

4\. Vesting. The RSU will vest and no longer be subject to the restrictions of and forfeiture under this Agreement in one-fourth (1/4th or 25%) increments on each anniversary of the Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the RSU shall be fully vested upon your Termination of Employment by reason of death or permanent disability. “Permanent disability” means that you are unable to perform your duties by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months, as reasonably determined by the Committee, in its discretion. 

5\. Payment After Vesting. Within ten days following the vesting of the RSU, you will be issued shares of Common Stock equal to the number of vested shares, in settlement of the RSU (subject to the withholding requirements described in Section 6 below, as applicable). 

6\. Withholding; Indemnity. 

(a) You understand that you (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any Tax Liability (as defined below) arising as a result of this Agreement or the transactions relating to the RSU. You agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company, any Subsidiary and your employing company (the “Employer”), if different (collectively, the “Company Group”), from and against any such Tax Liability. 

(b) The Company has the authority to deduct or withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any Tax Liability. At any time not less than five business days before any such Tax Liability arises, you may satisfy your Tax Liability, in whole or in part, by either: (i) electing to have the Company withhold from your salary or other cash compensation payable to you or shares otherwise to be delivered upon settlement of the RSU with a Fair Market Value equal to the 

2 

* * *

minimum amount of the tax withholding obligation, or (ii) paying the amount of the Tax Liability directly to the Company in cash. Unless you choose to satisfy your Tax Liability in accordance with subsection (ii) above, your Tax Liability will be automatically satisfied in accordance with subsection (i) above. The Committee or the Board will have the right to disapprove an election to pay your Tax Liability under subsection (ii) in its sole discretion. In the event your Tax Liability will be satisfied under subsection (i) above, then the Company, upon approval of the Committee or the Board, may elect (in lieu of withholding shares) to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on your behalf (pursuant to this authorization) a whole number of shares from those shares of Common Stock issuable to you upon settlement of the RSU as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy your Tax Liability. Your acceptance of this RSU constitutes your instruction and authorization to the Company and such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in the previous sentence, as applicable. Such shares will be sold on the day the Tax Liability arises or as soon thereafter as practicable. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the Plan in which all participants receive an average price. You will be responsible for all broker’s fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed your Tax Liability, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to you as soon as practicable. You acknowledge that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy your tax withholding obligation. The Company may refuse to issue any Common Stock in settlement of your RSU to you until your Tax Liability is satisfied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares issuable under the RSU or from salary payable to you, shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy your tax withholding obligation. 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, your “Tax Liability” shall mean (i) all federal, state, local and foreign withholding or other taxes applicable to your taxable income, plus (ii) if permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside, any liability of the Company Group for income tax, withholding tax and any social security contributions, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account obligation or other employment related taxes in any jurisdiction, in each case that may arise as a result of (w) the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSU, (x) the issuance to you of shares of Common Stock on the vesting or settlement of the RSU, (y) the disposition of any shares of Common Stock that were the subject of the RSU, or (z) any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold for the Tax Liability by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. 

7\. Not a Contract of Employment. In accepting the grant, you acknowledge, understand and agree that: 

(a) this agreement, the RSU grant and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment, shall not be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company Group, and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company Group to terminate your employment or service relationship (if any); 

(b) you have no right or entitlement to be granted an award of RSU or shares of Common Stock; the grant of the RSU is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of RSUs, or benefits in lieu of RSUs, even if RSUs have been granted in the past; 

(c) the RSU and the shares of Common Stock subject to the RSU are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

(h) the future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 

(i) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU resulting from your Termination of Employment, and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company Group, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company Group from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; 

(j) unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the RSU and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSU or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Common Stock; and 

(l) the following provisions apply only if you are providing services outside the United States: 

(A) the RSU and the shares of Common Stock subject to the RSU, and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose; and 

(B) the Company Group shall not be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSU or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the RSU or the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired upon settlement.

UNITED KINGDOM

Terms and Conditions 

In the United Kingdom, only Employees are eligible to be granted RSUs pursuant to the following additional terms: 

Responsibility for Taxes. This section supplements Section 6 of the Agreement: 

You agree that if you do not pay or the Employer or the Company does not withhold from you the full amount of income tax that you owe due to the vesting of the RSUs, or the release or assignment of the RSUs for consideration, or the receipt of any other benefit in connection with the RSUs (the “Taxable Event”) within 90 days after the end of the tax year in which the Taxable Event occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), then the amount that should have been withheld shall constitute a loan owed by you to the Employer, effective as of the Due Date. You agree that the loan will bear interest at the then current rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) and will be immediately due and repayable by you, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by withholding the funds from salary, bonus or any other funds due to you by the Employer, by withholding in shares of Common Stock issued upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs or from the cash proceeds from the sale of shares or by demanding cash or a cheque from the Participant. You also authorize the Company to delay the issuance of any shares of Common Stock to you unless and until the loan is repaid in full. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable. You acknowledge that the Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and national insurance contributions at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 6 of the Agreement. However, you are primarily responsible for reporting and paying any income tax and national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime. 

RSUs Payable in Shares. Notwithstanding any discretion in the Plan or anything to the contrary in the Agreement, RSUs do not provide any right for you to receive a cash payment; the RSUs are payable in shares of Common Stock only.
