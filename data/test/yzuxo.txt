• Upon termination of employment for any reason, other than (i) death, (ii) Disability or (iii) as provided in the SLM Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan for Senior Officers, any unvested Options will not vest and will be forfeited and canceled.  
  
• Upon termination of employment for death or Disability or as provided for under the SLM Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan for Senior Officers, all unvested Options will vest and vested Options (taking into account any vesting acceleration provided for, if any) are exercisable until the earlier of: (1) the Expiration Date; or (2) one year from the date of termination.

• Upon termination of employment for Misconduct, any Options, vested or unvested, are forfeited.  
  
E. Expiration. These Options expire ten years from the Grant Date (the “Expiration Date”), subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, which may provide for earlier expiration in certain instances, including Optionee’s termination of employment.  
  
F. Non-Transferable; Binding Effect. These Options may not be transferred except as provided for herein. All or any part of these Options may be transferred by the Optionee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition, Optionee may transfer all or any part of any Option to “Immediate Family Members.” “Immediate Family Members” means children, grandchildren, spouse or common law spouse, siblings or parents of the Optionee or bona fide trusts, partnerships or other entities controlled by and of which all beneficiaries are Immediate Family Members of the Optionee. Any Options that are transferred are further conditioned on the Optionee’s transferees and Immediate Family Members agreeing to abide by the Corporation’s then current stock option transfer guidelines. The terms of these Options shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, and successors of the Optionee.  
  
G. Net-Settlement upon Option Exercise; Taxes. These Options shall be exercised only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each exercise must be for no fewer than fifty (50) Options, other than an exercise for all remaining Options. Upon exercise of all or part of the Options, the Optionee shall receive from the Corporation the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from the following formula: the total number of Options exercised less the sum of “Shares for the Option Cost” and “Shares for Taxes”, rounded up to the nearest whole share. “Shares for the Option Cost” equals the Option Price multiplied by the number of Options exercised divided by the fair market value of SLM common stock at the time of exercise. “Shares for Taxes” equals the tax liability (the statutory withholding maximum) divided by the fair market value of SLM common stock at the time of exercise. Optionee shall receive cash for any resulting fractional share amount. As a condition to the issuance of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation pursuant to these Options, the Optionee agrees to remit to the Corporation (through the procedure described in this paragraph) at the time of any exercise of these Options any taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation under federal, state, or local law as a result of the exercise of these Options.  
  
H. Vesting Upon Change In Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section (D): 

(I) In the event of a Change of Control Transaction or a Change of Control in which the acquiring or surviving company in the transaction does not assume or continue outstanding Awards upon the Change of Control or Change of Control Transaction, immediately prior to such transactions, then if these Options are not assumed or continued as described above, then any portion of these Options that were not vested shall become 100 percent vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control or Change of Control Transaction; and  
  
(II) If Optionee’s employment shall terminate within twenty-four months of a Change of Control or a Change of Control Transaction other than for Misconduct, any Options not previously vested shall immediately become vested and exercisable upon such employment termination and such Options shall be excercisable until the earlier of: (1) the Expiration Date; or (2) three months from the date of termination.  
  
I. Clawback Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or an appropriate committee thereof, determines that, any material misstatement of financial results or a performance metric criteria has occurred as a result of the conduct of any officer at the Senior Vice President level or above (“Senior Officer”), or such Senior Officer has committed a material violation of corporate policy or has committed fraud or misconduct, then the Board or committee shall consider all factors, with particular scrutiny when one the top 20 members of management are involved, and the Board or such Committee, may in its sole discretion require reimbursement of any compensation resulting from the vesting and exercise of Options and the cancellation of any outstanding Options from such Senior Officer (whether or not such individual is currently employed by the Corporation) during the three-year period following the date the Board first learns of the violation, fraud or misconduct.
