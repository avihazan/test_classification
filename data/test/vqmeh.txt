APPENDIX A 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

1\. Grant. 

(a) The Company hereby grants to the Grantee under the Plan an award of the Number of Restricted Stock Units set forth on the Notice of Grant, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. For each Restricted Stock Unit that vests, the Grantee will be entitled to receive one (1) Share (subject to automatic adjustment for stock splits, combinations and other adjustments contemplated in the Plan). 

(b) When Shares are paid to the Grantee in payment for the Restricted Stock Units, par value ($.001 per share) will be deemed paid by the Grantee for each Restricted Stock Unit by services rendered by the Grantee, and will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings. 

2\. Company’s Obligation to Pay. Each Restricted Stock Unit has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date that the Restricted Stock Unit is granted. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units have vested in the manner set forth in Sections 3 through 5, the Grantee will have no right to payment of such Restricted Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of Shares upon the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation. Payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units shall be made in whole Shares only and any fractional Shares will be forfeited at the time of payment. 

3\. Vesting Schedule/Period of Restriction. Except as provided in Sections 4 and 5, and subject to Section 7, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Agreement shall vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth on the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units shall not vest in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement unless the Grantee shall have been continuously employed by the Company or by its Parent or other successor or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date through the dates the Restricted Stock Units are otherwise scheduled to vest. 

4\. Modifications to Vesting Schedule. 

(a) Vesting upon Leave of Absence. In the event that the Grantee takes an authorized leave of absence (“LOA”), the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Agreement that are eligible to be earned shall either: (i) not be affected, or (ii) shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of such LOA, based on the Company’s LOA policy in effect at such time as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 

* * *

(b) Death or Disability of Grantee. In the event that the Grantee’s relationship with the Company or its Parent or other successor or a Subsidiary as a Service Provider is terminated prior to full vesting of the Restricted Stock Units due to his or her death or Disability, the unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be forfeited on the date of the Grantee’s death or Disability. 

5\. Administrator Discretion. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. Such acceleration may result in tax or other consequences to the Grantee. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. If the Administrator, in its discretion, accelerates the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units nevertheless shall be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the Notice of Grant and Section 1 of this Agreement or as otherwise provided herein (whether or not the Grantee remains employed by the Company or by one of its Subsidiaries as of such date(s)). The Grantee is hereby advised to consult with the Grantee’s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Grantee’s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 

6\. Payment after Vesting. Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 through 4 of this Agreement will be paid to the Grantee (or in the event of the Grantee’s death, to his or her estate) as soon as practicable following the applicable vesting date, subject to Sections 9 and 21, but no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the applicable vesting date. 

7\. Forfeiture. The balance of the Restricted Stock Units that have not vested pursuant to Sections 3 through 5 at the time of the termination of the Grantee’s relationship with the Company as a Service Provider for any or no reason will be forfeited. 

8\. [Reserved.] 

9\. Withholding of Taxes. 

(a) General. Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Grantee’s employer (the “Employer”) take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholdings (“Tax-Related Items”), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Grantee is and remains the Grantee’s responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no guarantees or undertakings regarding the treatment of any 

* * *

Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the award, including the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares received at vesting and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the award to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax-Related Items. 

(b) Payment of Tax-Related Items. The Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, at its discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding a portion of the Shares issued as payment for vested Restricted Stock Units that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay all Tax-Related Items required to be withheld by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and issuance of the Shares, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, either requires or otherwise permits the Grantee to make alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Company for such withholdings in advance of the arising of any withholding obligations. The number of Shares withheld pursuant to the prior sentence will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, with no refund for any value of the Shares withheld in excess of the tax obligation as a result of such rounding. 

If the obligation of Tax-Related Items is satisfied by reducing the number of Shares delivered as described herein, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the award of Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the award. 

If the foregoing method of withholding is prohibited or insufficient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items required to be withheld by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and issuance of the Shares or if the Company, in its discretion, determines not to apply the foregoing method of withholding, then the Grantee hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy such obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Grantee’s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and/or the Employer, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (ii) selling the applicable number of Shares or arranging for the sale of the applicable number of Shares (in either case on the Grantee’s behalf and at the Grantee’s discretion pursuant to this authorization) issued in settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units and retaining the requisite proceeds from such sale. 

Finally, the Grantee shall pay to the Company and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company and/or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver to the Grantee any Shares pursuant to the award if the Grantee fails to comply with the Grantee’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items, as described in this Section 9. 

10\. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming under or through the Grantee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates 

* * *

representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Grantee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Grantee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 

11\. No Effect on Employment. Subject to any employment contract with the Grantee, the terms of such employment will be determined from time to time by the Company, or the Subsidiary employing the Grantee, as the case may be, and the Company, or the Subsidiary employing the Grantee, as the case may be, will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Grantee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time. A leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Grantee, as the case may be, shall not be deemed a termination of the Grantee’s relationship with the Company or its Subsidiary as a Service Provider for the purposes of this Agreement. 

12\. Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of Stock Administrator, at 1745 Technology Drive, San Jose, California, 95110, USA, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing, with a copy to the Company, C/O General Counsel, 1745 Technology Drive, San Jose, California, 95110, USA. 

13\. Grant is Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in this Agreement or the Plan, this grant of Restricted Stock Units and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process, until the Grantee has been issued Shares in payment of the Restricted Stock Units. Upon any attempt to sell, pledge, assign, hypothecate, transfer or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantee may, in a manner and in accordance with terms specified by the Administrator, transfer these Restricted Stock Units to Grantee’s spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-approved domestic relations order which relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights. 

14\. Restrictions on Sale of Securities. The Shares issued as payment for vested Restricted Stock Units under this Agreement will be registered under U.S. federal securities laws and will be freely tradable upon receipt. However, a Grantee’s subsequent sale of the Shares may be subject to any market blackout-period that may be imposed by the Company and must comply with the Company’s insider trading policies, and any other U.S. securities laws or other Applicable Laws. 

* * *

15\. Binding Agreement. Subject to the limitation on the transferability of this grant contained herein, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

16\. Additional Conditions to Issuance of Certificates for Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to fulfillment of all the following conditions: (a) the admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed; (b) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any U.S. state or federal or non-U.S. law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, which the Administrator shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable; (c) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any U.S. state or federal or non-U.S. governmental agency, which the Administrator shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the Vesting Date of the Restricted Stock Units as the Administrator may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience. 

17\. Plan Governs. This Agreement is subject to all the terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. 

18\. Administrator Authority. The Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Restricted Stock Units have vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon the Grantee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Administrator will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement. 

19\. Captions. Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement. 

20\. Agreement Severable. In the event that any provision in this Agreement will be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 

21\. Modifications to the Agreement. This Agreement, including Appendix A, together with the Plan, constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered, subject to any applicable pre-existing agreement or agreement entered into after the date hereof relating to full or partial acceleration of vesting in the event of a change of 

* * *

control of the Company (or similar event). The Grantee expressly warrants that he or she is not accepting this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein or expressly contemplated above. Modifications to this Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or this Agreement, the Company reserves the right to revise this Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Grantee, to comply with Section 409A of the Code or to otherwise avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A of the Code prior to the actual payment of Shares pursuant to this award of Restricted Stock Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by Section 409A of the Code, no Restricted Stock Units will be paid to the Grantee (or in the event of the Grantee’s death, to his or her estate) earlier than six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the termination of the Grantee’s relationship with the Company as a Service Provider, subject to Section 9. 

22\. Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan. By accepting this Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Grantee expressly warrants that he or she has received a right to receive stock under the Plan, and has received, read and understood a description of the Plan. The Grantee understands that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, except as otherwise provided in the Plan and/or the Agreement. 

23\. Labor Law and Nature of Grant. In accepting the award of Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee acknowledges that: 

(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company;

(d) the Grantee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; 

(e) the award is an extraordinary item that is outside the scope of the Grantee’s employment or service contract, if any;

(g) in the event that the Grantee is not an employee of the Company, the award will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or 

* * *

relationship with the Company; and, furthermore, the award will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Employer or any Parent or other successor or a Subsidiary of the Company; 

(h) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; 

(i) the Company is not providing any tax, legal, or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Grantee’s participation in the Plan or the acquisition or sale of Shares; and

The Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Grantee’s personal data as described in the Notice of Grant and this Agreement and any other Restricted Stock Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Grantee’s participation in the Plan.
