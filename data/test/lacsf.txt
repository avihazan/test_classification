WHEREAS, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Tasty Baking Company 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”) on ___________, 1997, and the Plan was approved by shareholders of the Company on ___________, 1997; and 

  


WHEREAS, as additional compensation for Grantee’s past and future services to the Employer, and to induce the Grantee to continue his or her efforts to enhance the value of the Company for shareholders, generally, and pursuant to the actions of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Board’s Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) on the Grant Date, the Company wishes to transfer shares of Common Stock of the Company to Grantee pursuant to the terms of the Plan, subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  


NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and Grantee hereby agree as follows:

  


1. As of the Grant Date, the Company shall transfer to Grantee __________________ (________) shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.50 per share (“Award Shares”), at which time Grantee shall become the beneficial owner of the Award Shares so transferred, with the right to vote the Award Shares and receive dividends with respect to the Award Shares, subject to the risk of forfeiture conditions and transfer restrictions set forth herein. 

  


2. (a) The Grantee’s right to beneficial ownership of the Award Shares shall become permanently vested and nonforfeitable, and they shall be released from the transfer restrictions set forth herein on the earlier of (i) fifth anniversary of the Grant Date, provided that Grantee remains in the continuous employment of the Employer as of such date; or (ii) upon the retirement of the Grantee with the approval of the Company. 

  


(b) Prior to the vesting of the Award Shares pursuant to Paragraph 2(a), above, no Award Share (including any shares received by Grantee with respect to the Award Shares as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization or a similar transaction affecting the Company’s securities without receipt of consideration) may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered. 

  


(c) If the Grantee’s employment with the Employer is terminated for any reason (excluding death) before he or she has become vested in the Award Shares pursuant to Paragraph 2(a), above, the Grantee shall forfeit the Award Shares, whether or not the Grantee is reemployed by the Employer. 

  


(d) If a Grantee dies while in the employ of the Employer prior to the vesting of the Award Shares pursuant to Paragraph 2(a), above, all of the Award Shares shall become nonforfeitable and shall be delivered to the beneficiary designated by the Grantee pursuant to such rules and procedures established by the Committee.

3. Unless the Grantee and the Company make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company with respect to the payment of withholding taxes, upon vesting of the Award Shares pursuant to Paragraph 2(a) above, the Award Shares shall be reduced by that number of Award Shares having a value, as of the date they become vested, equal to the minimum amount of Federal, state and local taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Award Shares.

  


4\.  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Grantee any right to continue in the employ of the Employer or any affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of such person to terminate Grantee’s employment at any time, subject to the terms of any employment agreement by and between the Employer and Grantee.
