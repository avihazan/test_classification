(b) The Registration Statement (and any further documents to be filed with the SEC) contains all exhibits and schedules as required by the Securities Act. Each of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time it became effective, complied in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations and did not and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, each as of its respective date, comply or will comply in all material r espects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations.

The Incorporated Documents, when they were filed with the SEC, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations and none of such Incorporated Documents, when they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Base Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement, when such documents are filed with the SEC, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations, as applicable and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations or warranties as to information, if any, contained in or omitted from the Prospectus Supplement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Purchaser specifically for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement. No post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement reflecting any facts or events arising after the date thereof which represent, individually or in the aggregate, a fundamental change in the information set forth therein is required t o be filed with the SEC.
