(a) Employee has breached a material term hereof, which remains uncured for thirty (30) days after a written notice of breach (which notice shall describe the particulars of Employee’s breach in sufficient detail to allow Employee the reasonable opportunity to cure the breach, if susceptible of being cured within such thirty (30) day period) and written demand for performance are delivered to Employee by the CEO or Board;

(f) Employee’s breach of the Proprietary Information Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A, and described in paragraph 6 herein.

  


3.1.2 Termination for Good Reason. 

  


(a) Employee may terminate this Agreement for “Good Reason.” As used herein, “Good Reason” means (i) any material breach by NutraCea of this Agreement; (ii) the assignment of duties to Employee by NutraCea that are not consistent or commensurate with and her position as Chief Financial Officer of NutraCea (other than any duties that are consistent and commensurate with a higher position, and not including any reduction in Employee’s duties during any investigation or proceedings initiated by NutraCea in good faith pursuant to Section 3.1.1 with regard to a possible termination of Employee for Cause); (iii) the relocation of Employee’s primary office location to outside of the Phoenix metropolitan area without Employee’s prior consent; (iv) the reduction of Employee’s Base Salary; (v) the failure of NutraCea to obtain at least forty-five (45) days in advance of an event described in Section 4.3.1(x) or (y) an agreement from a successor or purchaser to assume and perform the terms of this Agreement; or (vi) NutraCea’s termination of Employee’s status as Chief Financial Officer of NutraCea.

  


(b) In order to terminate this Agreement for Good Reason, Employee shall provide NutraCea with (i) written notice of the Good Reason (which notice shall describe the particulars of NutraCea’s breach in sufficient detail to allow NutraCea the reasonable opportunity to remedy or eliminate the Good Reason(s) if susceptible of being remedied or eliminated); and (ii) shall allow NutraCea thirty (30) days within which to remedy or eliminate the Good Reason(s). In the event that Employee provides such notice and NutraCea fails to remedy or eliminate the Good Reason(s) within such thirty-day period, Employee shall be entitled to provide NutraCea with written notice (of not less that thirty (30) days) that Employee is terminating this Agreement as a result of such Good Reason(s). 

  


3.2 Payments upon Termination. 

3.2.1 For Cause or Voluntary Termination. Following a termination of this Agreement by NutraCea for Cause, or a Voluntary Termination by Employee, or any other termination by Employee other than for Good Reason or due to her death, Employee shall be entitled to receive in cash payment (less normal and customary deductions and withholdings) an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid compensation (including accrued but unused vacation leave) as of the date of such termination. By way of example, if NutraCea were to terminate this Agreement for Cause on June 30, 2009, Employee would be entitled to receive any compensation she had earned through June 30, 2009, but which had not been paid to her as of June 30, 2009. 

  


3.2.2 Without Cause. Following any termination of this Agreement by NutraCea other than for Cause, or a termination by Employee for Good Reason or due to Employee’s death, Employee (or Employee’s estate) shall be entitled to receive in cash payment an amount equal to all previously accrued but unpaid compensation (including accrued but unused vacation leave) as of the date of such termination, and a lump sum payment (less normal and customary deductions and withholdings) equal to the amount of Base Salary that Employee would have earned if she had remained employed with NutraCea during the remaining portion of the then-current Term of this Agreement. By way of example, if NutraCea were to terminate this Agreement for no Cause on June 30, 2009, Employee would be entitled to receive any compensation she had earned through June 30, 2009, but which had not been paid to her as of June 30, 2009, and an amount equal to the Base Salary that Employee would have earned under this Agreement if she had worked until November 6, 2011\.

On the first anniversary of the CFO Effective Date and each anniversary date thereafter , Employee’s Base Salary shall be increased annually by a minimum of a cost of living factor determined as follows: (i) Employee’s Base Salary as of the last day of the prior Contract Year shall be multiplied by a fraction equal to (A) the published Consumer Price Index selected by NutraCea (“CPI”) for the first day of the new Contract Year (“New Year”), divided by (B) the CPI for the first day of the Contract Year immediately preceding such New Year, and (ii) the resulting product shall be added to Employee’s Base Salary, and shall be the Base Salary for the New Year.
