To that end, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Employee may dedicate some of his business time to other ventures that do not compete directly with the business of the Company and that doing so shall not be a violation of Employee’s obligations under this Agreement.

  


1.4 Base Salary. The Company shall pay Employee a base salary (the “Base Salary”) at the annual rate of $216,000 (U.S.), payable at such times as the Company customarily pays its other senior level executives.

1.5 Discretionary Bonus. From time to time during the Term, the Company may pay to the Employee additional compensation in an amount determined by the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

Employee covenants that he will not, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Board of Directors, at any time during the course of Employee’s employment use any Confidential Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation except in connection with the performance of Employee’s duties for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company’s policies regarding Confidential Information.

Employee also covenants that at any time after the termination of such employment, directly or indirectly, he will not use any Confidential Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation, unless such information is in the public domain through no fault of Employee or except when required to do so by a court of law, by any governmental agency having supervisory authority over the business of the Company or by any administrative or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with apparent jurisdiction to order Employee to divulge, disclose or make accessible such information.

  


All written Confidential Information (including, without limitation, in any computer or other electronic format) which comes into Employee’s possession during the course of Employee’s employment shall remain the property of the Company. Upon termination of Employee’s employment, the Employee agrees to return immediately to the Company all written Confidential Information (including, without limitation, in any computer or other electronic format) in Employee’s possession.

4\. Termination.

  


4.1 By Company.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Termination for Cause" means, a termination by reason of any of the following:

  


(i) Employee’s conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony; or

(ii) Employee is engaging or has engaged in material fraud, material dishonesty, or other acts of willful and continued misconduct in connection with the business affairs of the Company;

(iv) any other material breach by the Company of this Agreement.

(d) If all, or any portion, of the payments provided under this Agreement, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which Employee receives or is entitled to receive from the Company, would constitute an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (whether or not under an existing plan, arrangement or other agreement) (each such parachute payment, a “Parachute Payment”), and would result in the imposition on the Employee of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then, in addition to any other benefits to which the Employee is entitled under this Agreement, the Employee shall be paid by the Company an amount in cash equal to the sum of the excise taxes payable by the Employee by reason of receiving Parachute Payments plus the amount necessary to put the Employee in the same after-tax position (taking into account any and all applicable federal, state and local excise, income or other taxes at the highest possible applicable rates on such Parachute Payments (including without limitation any payments under this Section 4.1(d)) as if no excise taxes had been imposed with respect to Parachute Payments.

  


4.2 By Employee’s Death or Disability. This Agreement shall also be terminated upon the Employee’s death and/or a finding of permanent physical or mental disability, such disability expected to result in death or to be of a continuous duration of no less than twelve (12) months, and the Employee is unable to perform his usual and essential duties for the Company. In the event of termination by reason of Employee’s death and/or permanent disability, Employee or his executors, legal representatives or administrators, as applicable, shall be entitled to an amount equal to Employee’s Base Salary accrued through the date of termination, plus a pro rata share of any annual bonus to which Employee would otherwise be entitled for the year which death or permanent disability occurs.

  


4.4 Voluntary Termination. Employee may voluntarily terminate the Employment Term upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice for any reason; provided, however, that no further payments shall be due under this Agreement in that event except that Employee shall be entitled to any benefits due under any compensation or benefit plan provided by the Company for executives or otherwise outside of this Agreement.
