* * *

(ii)

Performance Option. If the Company, on a consolidated basis, achieves its annual EBITDA targets as set forth in Schedule A attached hereto (each an “EBITDA Target” or “Annual Performance Target”) for the applicable given Fiscal Year, then the Performance Option shall be eligible to become vested and exercisable as to a percentage of the Shares subject to such Option at the end of each of the six Fiscal Years as follows:

(e)

Notwithstanding the foregoing but except as provided in Section 3.1(b), no Option shall become exercisable as to any additional shares of Common Stock following the termination of employment of the Optionee for any reason and any Option, which is unexercisable as of the Optionee’s termination of employment, shall immediately expire without payment therefor.
