2015 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 



(Employment Agreements and Restrictive Covenants) 

C&J; Energy Services Ltd. (the “Company”), a Bermuda exempted company, hereby awards to you (the “Grantee”), as of the date set forth on your Bank of America Merrill Lynch online equity award account (the “Date of Grant”), an award of restricted shares (the “Award”), consisting of the number of Shares set forth on your Bank of America Merrill Lynch online equity award account for that date (the “Restricted Shares”), pursuant to the C&J; Energy Services 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the “Plan”). The Award is subject to the terms of this Restricted Share Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. The Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall be issued in the name of the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable after the Date of Grant, pursuant to the terms herein, and shall be subject to the execution and return of this Agreement by the Grantee through the electronic signature and/or web-based approval and notice process authorized by the Company. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning attributed to such terms under the Plan, unless the context requires otherwise. By executing this Agreement, the Grantee acknowledges that his or her agreement to the covenants set forth in Section 7 is a material inducement to the Company in granting this Award to the Grantee. 

The terms and conditions of the Restricted Shares granted hereby, to the extent not controlled by the terms and conditions contained in the Plan, are as follows: 

1\. No Right to Continued Employee Status or Consultant Service 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Grantee the right to the continuation of his or her Employee status, or, in the case of a Consultant, to the continuation of his or her service arrangement, or in either case to interfere with the right of the Company or, as applicable, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to terminate the Grantee’s Business Relationship (as defined in Section 7) at any time. 

2\. Coordination with Employment Agreement 

The parties hereby acknowledge that the Grantee is a party to an employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company (the “Employment Agreement”), which may include provisions governing the treatment of share options, restricted shares or other equity-based awards granted to the Grantee prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that, to the extent that the Employment Agreement includes provisions in respect of the treatment of share options, restricted shares or other equity-based awards in the event of termination of employment, a change in control, or other similar event, (i) notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, such provisions in the Employment Agreement shall govern the treatment of the Restricted Shares covered by the Award granted under this Agreement; and (ii) if, and to the extent, such provisions in the Employment Agreement conflict with the provisions in this Agreement, the terms of the Employment Agreement shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Employment Agreement is silent regarding matters concerning 

* * *

the treatment of share options, restricted shares or other equity-based awards in the event of termination of employment, a change in control, or other similar event, then the terms of this Agreement shall govern the treatment of the Restricted Shares granted hereunder. Nothing herein (including nothing contained in Section 7 herein) will replace any of the Grantee’s obligations to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure, return of property, non-competition or non-solicitation as all provisions of Section 7 herein are in addition to all commitments and obligations the Grantee has to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including all commitments and obligations created by contract, statute and common law.

(c)

Right to Cancellation and Recovery. The Grantee understands and agrees that the Company has granted this Award to the Grantee to reward the Grantee for the Grantee’s future efforts and loyalty to the Company, its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates by giving the Grantee the opportunity to participate in the potential future appreciation of the Company.

* * *

which the Grantee is a party, or (y) the Grantee is Terminated for Cause, or (z) the Grantee violates Section 7 hereof, (collectively items (t) – (z), “Prohibited Actions”) then, subject to Section 7(c)(iii) below, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to the Company, the Company shall be entitled, at its option, exercisable by written notice (the date of such notice, the “Forfeiture Notice Date”) to take any the following actions:   
  
(i) The Company may terminate this Award and immediately cancel the Restricted Shares for which the Transfer Restrictions have not yet lapsed; and   
  
(ii) If such Prohibited Action occurs during the period of the Grantee’s Business Relationship or within two (2) years following the Grantee’s Termination, the Company may recover from the Grantee, and the Grantee shall pay over to the Company, with respect to any Restricted Shares on which the Transfer Restrictions lapsed during the period of two (2) years prior to the earlier of the occurrence of the Prohibited Action or the Grantee’s Termination (A) with respect to any such Shares that the Grantee continues to own as of the Forfeiture Notice Date, an amount equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Shares on the Forfeiture Notice Date; and (B) with respect to any such Shares that the Grantee no longer owns as of the Forfeiture Notice Date, an amount equal to either (x) if such Shares were disposed of in an open market transaction, the proceeds received from the disposition of the Restricted Shares, or (y) if such Shares were disposed of other than in an open market transaction, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Restricted Shares as of the Forfeiture Notice Date. If the Grantee does not pay such amount over to the Company within twenty (20) days of demand, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at the maximum rate permitted by law and the Grantee shall be liable for all of the Company’s costs of collection, including but not limited to, reasonable legal fees.   
  
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that a Change in Control has occurred and the Grantee is Terminated without Cause within the twelve (12) months following the Change in Control, the Company may take the actions set forth in Sections 7(c)(i) and (ii) only if the Grantee engages in any Prohibited Disclosure or Use or breaches or violates the Grantee’s obligations relating to the non-disclosure or non-use of confidential or proprietary information under any Restrictive Agreement to which the Grantee is a party.   
  
(d) Other Remedies. The Grantee specifically acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach of this Section 7 will be inadequate and that the Company, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled at the discretion of the Board to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. In the event that the provisions of this Section 7 should ever be deemed to exceed the limitation provided by applicable law, then the Grantee and the Company agree that such provisions shall be reformed to set forth the maximum limitations permitted.

The Grantee understands that, unless a timely election is made pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), when the Restricted Shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (i.e., generally when the Restricted Shares vest), the Grantee will be obligated to recognize income, for Federal, state and local income tax purposes, as applicable, in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares, determined as of the date the Restricted Shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The acceptance of the Shares by the Grantee shall constitute an agreement by the Grantee to report such income in accordance with then applicable law and to cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries in establishing the amount of such income and corresponding deduction to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries for its income tax purposes. 

The Grantee is responsible for all tax obligations that arise in connection with the Restricted Shares. The Company may withhold from any amount payable to the Grantee an amount sufficient to cover any Federal, state or local withholding taxes which may become required with respect to the vesting of the Restricted Shares or take any other action it deems necessary to satisfy any income or other tax withholding requirements as a result of the vesting of the Award. The Company shall have the right to require the payment of any such taxes and require that the Grantee furnish information deemed necessary by the Company to meet any tax reporting obligation as a condition to issuing and releasing any Shares pursuant to the Award. The Committee, in its discretion (which such discretion, if the Grantee is a “statutory insider” within the meaning of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, may not be delegated to management), may allow the Grantee to pay his or her withholding tax obligation in connection with the 

8 

* * *

vesting of the Restricted Shares by (x) making a cash payment to the Company, (y) permitting the purchase (subject to the requirements of Bermuda law) of a portion of the Shares that have become vested, or (z) surrendering Shares owned by the Participant prior to vesting of the Award, in each case having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the withholding taxes. 

The Grantee hereby acknowledges that, with respect to the grant of Restricted Shares pursuant to this Award, he or she may file an election with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days of the Date of Grant, under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed on the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Shares as of the Date of Grant. The Grantee will seek the advice of his own tax advisors as to the advisability of making such a Section 83(b) election, the potential consequences of making such an election, the requirements for making such an election, and the other tax consequences of his Award under Federal, state, and any other laws that may be applicable. The Company and its agents have not and are not providing any tax advice to the Grantee. 

9\. Securities Laws 

Upon the acquisition of the Restricted Shares, the Grantee will make such written representations, warranties, and agreements as the Committee may reasonably request in order to comply with securities laws or with this Agreement. The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and such approvals by governmental agencies as may be required. The Grantee hereby agrees not to offer, sell or otherwise attempt to dispose of any Shares issued to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement in any way which would: (x) require the Company to file any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any similar filing under state law or the laws of any other county) or to amend or supplement any such filing or (y) violate or cause the Company to violate the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other Federal, state or local law, or the laws of any other country.

9

void and replaced with the applicable provision of the Plan.

The Committee shall have authority to make constructions of this Agreement, and to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Agreement, and to prescribe rules and regulations relating to the administration of this Award and other Awards granted under the Plan. 

This Award shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof. Delaware has a substantial relationship to the parties and transaction reflected herein and, in signing below, the Grantee acknowledges and agrees that there is a reasonable basis for the choice of Delaware law, as Delaware law is known to the parties and well-developed with respect to the subject matters of this Agreement. The designation of Delaware law and the interpretation and application of this Agreement consistent with principles of Delaware law assures uniformity, certainty and predictability in the application of the Agreement and the Plan through which the Award is granted.

12\. Headings and Capitalized Terms

13\. Severability and Reformation 

If any provision of this Agreement (or part thereof) shall be determined by a court of law to be unenforceable for any reason, such unenforceability shall not affect the enforceability of any of the remaining provisions hereof (or parts thereof), as such unenforceable provision (or part thereof) shall be severable and this Agreement, to the fullest extent lawful, shall be reformed and construed as if such unenforceable provision, or part thereof, had never been contained herein, and such provision or part thereof shall be reformed or construed so that it would be enforceable to the maximum extent legally possible. 

14\. Binding Effect 

This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, together with their personal executors, administrator, successors, personal representatives, heirs and permitted assigns. 

15\. Entire Agreement 

This Agreement supersedes all prior written and oral agreements and understandings among the parties as to its subject matter and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except to the extent that the Plan may be considered to address the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be in addition to, and shall not supersede or replace, any other Restrictive Agreements. If there is any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, then the applicable terms of the Plan shall govern. 

10 

* * *

16\. Waiver 

Waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement or failure to exercise any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or right whether or not of the same or a similar nature. The failure of any party to take action by reason of such breach or to exercise any such right shall not deprive the party of the right to take action at any time while or after such breach or condition giving rise to such rights continues.
