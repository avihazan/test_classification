15\. Effect of Section 409A. It is expressly contemplated by the parties that this Agreement will conform to, and be interpreted to comply with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Mr. Edwards is a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code at the time of his separation from service, then the payment of any amount this Agreement which is considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be deferred for six (6) months after his “separation from service” or, if earlier, his death as required by Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (the “409A Deferral Period”). In the event payments are otherwise due to be made in installments or periodically during the 409A Deferral Period, the payments which would otherwise have been made in the 409A Deferral Period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum as soon as the 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance of the payments shall be made as otherwise scheduled. For purposes of this Agreement, Mr. Edwards shall not be deemed to have terminated employment unless he has a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code where it is reasonably anticipated that no further services will be performed after such date or that the level of bona fide services he will perform after that date (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed by him over the immediately preceding 36-month period. All rights to payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be treated as rights to receive a series of separate payments and benefits to the fullest extent allowed by Section 409A of the Code.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Cosi has caused this Agreement to be duly executed on its behalf and Mr. Edwards has hereunder set his hand, all as of the date first above written.
