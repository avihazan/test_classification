1. This Comp Plan shall be in effect for Company’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2003. It is the present intention of the parties to enter into successive written US sales incentive compensation plans in future years including the targets set forth in paragraph 3.b. below, but Company shall have no obligation to do so.   
  
2. The terms and conditions of this Comp Plan shall be interpreted by the President of Company, whose judgment regarding any determination shall be final and binding on all parties.   
  
3. Company shall pay an amount not to exceed $200,000 (hereinafter the “Target Bonus”) not later than May 15, 2003 based on the following events:   
  
a. U.S. Sales Bonus. 35% of the Target Bonus (hereinafter the “US Sales Bonus”) shall be based on net sales of Company for FY 2003 being 30% greater than net sales of Company for FY 2002. The U.S. Sales Bonus shall be prorated in the event net sales for the period are greater in FY 2003 than in FY 2002. In computing net sales, no credit for extraordinary items nor for sales made in other jurisdictions shall be given.   
  
b. New Business Bonus. 65% of the Target Bonus (hereinafter the “New Business Bonus”) in FY 2003 shall be based on New Business (as hereinafter defined) reaching 15% of net sales of PEAK on a consolidated basis.

Page 10 

FY 2005 the New Business Bonus target is expected to be 50% of net sales of PEAK. The New Business Bonus shall be prorated in the event New Business in FY 2003 is greater than New Business in FY 2002. In computing net sales, no credit for extraordinary items nor for sales made in other jurisdictions shall be given.   
  
i. “New Business” means revenues, obtained primarily as a result of the effort and skill of Company employees, recognized by a PEAK subsidiary from a customer that has not purchased products from a PEAK subsidiary on or before April 1, 2002, nor was previously affiliated with any such customer.   
  
ii. Extraordinary items shall be excluded from the computation of net sales.   
  
c. Profitability Factor. The Target Bonus shall be factored based on PEAK’s profitability determined by dividing PEAK’s operating income (excluding extraordinary gains) for the fiscal year by PEAK’s net sales for the fiscal year. The resulting percent profitability shall be multiplied by 5 to determine the factor. The Target Bonus shall then be multiplied by the factor to determine the amount payable. If PEAK is not profitable, then no amount shall be payable hereunder. In no event shall the factor exceed 100 percent.
