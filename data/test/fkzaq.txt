(v) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the consummation of the Agreement and Plan of Merger among KHI Parent Inc., KHI Merger Sub Inc. and Harman International Industries, Incorporated, dated as of April 26, 2007, shall not constitute a Change in Control for purposes of this Agreement.
