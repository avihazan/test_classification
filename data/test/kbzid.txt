2\. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors.

  


Written notice of the annual meeting shall be given not less than ten (or, if sent by third-class mail, thirty) nor more than sixty days prior to the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat. The notice shall state the place, day, and hour of such meeting, and those matters which the Board, at the time of mailing, intends to present for action by the shareholders.

  


Notice of any meeting of the shareholders shall be given by mail or telegraphic or other written communication, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the stock entitled to vote thereat, at his address, as it appears on the books of the Corporation.

  


At an annual meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, including the nomination of any person (other than a person nominated by or at the direction of the Board) for election to the Board, the shareholder must have given timely and proper written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, the shareholder’s written notice must be received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than forty-five days before the date corresponding to the mailing date of the notice and proxy materials for the prior year’s annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that if the annual meeting to which the shareholder’s written notice relates is to be held on a date that differs by more than thirty days from the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder’s written notice to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day

following the date on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is made or given to shareholders. Any shareholder’s written notice that is delivered after the close of business (5:00 p.m. local time) will be considered received on the following business day. To be proper, the shareholder’s written notice must set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (b) the name and address of the shareholder as they appear on the Corporation’s books, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. In addition, if the shareholder’s written notice relates to the nomination at the annual meeting of any person for election to the Board, such notice to be proper must also set forth (a) the name, age, business address, and residence address of each person to be so nominated, (b) the principal occupation or employment of each such person, (c) the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by each such person, and (d) such other information concerning each such person as would be required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such person as a Director, and must be accompanied by a consent, signed by each such person, to serve as a Director of the Corporation if elected.
