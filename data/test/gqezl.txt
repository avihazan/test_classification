(a) After demand for arbitration has been made by serving written notice under the terms of Section 12.3 of this Agreement, the party demanding arbitration shall file a demand for arbitration with the office of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) located in Los Angeles, California. The arbitrator shall be selected from the JAMS panel and the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to JAMS policies and procedures.

(c) Either party may file a motion for summary judgment with the arbitrator. The arbitrator is entitled to resolve some or all of the asserted claims through such a motion. The standards to be applied by the arbitrator in ruling on a motion for summary judgment shall be the applicable laws as specified in Section 12.4(b) of this Agreement.

(d) Discovery shall be allowed and conducted pursuant to the then-applicable arbitration rules of JAMS, provided that the parties shall be entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their claims and defenses.
