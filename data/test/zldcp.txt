EQUITABLE FINANCIAL CORP.

The undersigned, Robert J. Routh, whose address is 233 South 13th Street, 1900 U.S. Bank Building Lincoln, Nebraska, 68508, being at least eighteen years of age, acting as incorporator, does hereby form a corporation under the general laws of the State of Maryland, having the following Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”):

ARTICLE 1. Name. The name of the corporation is Equitable Financial Corp. (the “Corporation”).

ARTICLE 2. Principal Office. The address of the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Maryland is c/o CSC-Lawyers Incorporating Service Company, 7 St. Paul Street, Suite 820, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.

ARTICLE 3. Purpose. The purpose for which the Corporation is formed is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the general laws of the State of Maryland as now or hereafter in force.

ARTICLE 4. Resident Agent. The name and address of the resident agent of the Corporation in the State of Maryland is CSC-Lawyers Incorporating Service Company, 7 St. Paul Street, Suite 820, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. Said resident agent is a Maryland corporation.

ARTICLE 5. Capital Stock.

A. Authorized Stock. The total number of shares of capital stock of all classes that the Corporation has authority to issue is thirty-five million (35,000,000) shares, consisting of:

1. Ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share (the “Preferred Stock”); and

2. Twenty five million (25,000,000) shares of common stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share (the “Common Stock”).

The aggregate par value of all the authorized shares of capital stock is three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($350,000). Except to the extent required by governing law, rule or regulation, the shares of capital stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors without further approval of the stockholders of the Corporation. The Corporation shall have the authority to purchase its capital stock out of funds lawfully available therefor, which funds shall include, without limitation, the Corporation’s unreserved and unrestricted capital surplus. The Board of Directors, pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the

* * *

  


Whole Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and without action by the stockholders, may amend these Articles to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue. For the purposes of these Articles, the term “Whole Board” shall mean the total number of directors that the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies on the Board of Directors at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption.

B. Common Stock. Except as provided under the terms of any series of Preferred Stock and as limited by Section D of this Article 5, the exclusive voting power shall be vested in the Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, each holder of the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock standing in the holder’s name on the books of the Corporation. Subject to any rights and preferences of any series of Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds lawfully available therefor. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them, respectively, after: (i) payment or provision for payment of the Corporation’s debts and liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for distributions in settlement of the Liquidation Account established by the Corporation as described in Section G of this Article 5; and (iii) distributions or provisions for distributions to holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock in the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

C. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of the shares of Preferred Stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the shares of each such series. The number of authorized shares of the Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock, without a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required by law or pursuant to the terms of such Preferred Stock. The power of the stockholders to increase or decrease the authorized shares of the Preferred Stock shall not limit any of the powers of the Board of Directors provided under these Articles.

D. Restrictions on Voting Rights of the Corporation’s Equity Securities.

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, in no event shall the record owner (or if more than one record owner, all such record owners taken as a group) of any outstanding Common Stock that is beneficially owned,

2

* * *

  


directly or indirectly, by a Person who, as of any record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on any matter, beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “Limit”), be entitled, or permitted to any vote in respect of the shares held in excess of the Limit. The number of votes that may be cast by any particular record owner by virtue of the provisions hereof in respect of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Person owning shares in excess of the Limit (a “Holder in Excess”) shall be a number equal to the total number of votes that a single record owner of all Common Stock owned by such Holder in Excess would be entitled to cast after giving effect to the provisions hereof, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of such class or series that are both (i) beneficially owned by such Holder in Excess and (ii) owned of record by such particular record owner and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder in Excess. The provisions of this Section D of this Article 5 shall not be applicable if, before the Holder in Excess acquired beneficial ownership of such shares in excess of the Limit, such acquisition was approved by a majority of the “Unaffiliated Directors.” For this purpose, the term “Unaffiliated Director” means any member of the Board of Directors who is unaffiliated with the Holder in Excess and was a member of the Board of Directors prior to the time that the Holder in Excess became such, and any director who is thereafter chosen to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors and who is elected and who, in either event, is unaffiliated with the Holder in Excess and in connection with his or her initial assumption of office is recommended for appointment or election by a majority of the Unaffiliated Directors then serving on the Board of Directors.

2. The following definitions shall apply to this Section D of this Article 5.

a. An “affiliate” of a specified Person shall mean a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Person specified.

b. “Beneficial ownership” shall be determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or any successor rule or statutory provision), or, if said Rule 13d-3 shall be rescinded and there shall be no successor rule or statutory provision thereto, pursuant to said Rule 13d-3 in effect as of the date which these Articles are filed with the Secretary of State of Maryland; provided, however, that a Person shall, in any event, also be deemed the “beneficial owner” of any Common Stock:

i. That such Person or any of its affiliates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly; or

ii. That such Person or any of its affiliates has (i) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), pursuant to any agreement,

3

* * *

  


arrangement or understanding (but shall not be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any voting shares solely by reason of an agreement, contract, or other arrangement with the Corporation to effect any transaction of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of Article 9 hereof) or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants, or options or otherwise, or (ii) sole or shared voting or investment power with respect thereto pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise (but shall not be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any voting shares solely by reason of a revocable proxy granted for a particular meeting of stockholders, pursuant to a public solicitation of proxies for such meeting, with respect to shares of which neither such Person nor any such affiliate is otherwise deemed the beneficial owner); or

iii. That are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person with which such first mentioned Person or any of its affiliates acts as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation; and provided further, however, that (i) no director or officer of the Corporation (or any affiliate of any such director or officer) shall, solely by reason of any or all of such directors or officers acting in their capacities as such, be deemed, for any purposes hereof, to beneficially own any Common Stock beneficially owned by any other such director or officer (or any affiliate thereof), and (ii) neither any employee stock ownership or similar plan of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation nor any trustee with respect thereto (or any affiliate of such trustee) shall, solely by reason of such capacity of such trustee, be deemed, for any purposes hereof, to beneficially own any Common Stock held under any such plan. For purposes of computing the percentage of beneficial ownership of Common Stock of a Person, the outstanding Common Stock shall include shares deemed owned by such Person through application of this subsection but shall not include any other shares of Common Stock that may be issuable by the Corporation pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise. For all other purposes, the outstanding Common Stock shall include only Common Stock then outstanding and shall not include any Common Stock that may be issuable by the Corporation pursuant to any agreement, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

* * *

  


c. A “Person” shall mean any individual, firm, corporation, or other entity.

d. The Board of Directors shall have the power to construe and apply the provisions of this Section D and to make all determinations necessary or desirable to implement such provisions including, but not limited to, matters with respect to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any Person, (ii) whether a Person is an affiliate of another, (iii) whether a Person has an agreement, arrangement, or understanding with another as to the matters referred to in the definition of beneficial ownership, (iv) the application of any other definition or operative provision of this Section D to the given facts, or (v) any other matter relating to the applicability or effect of this Section D.

3. The Board of Directors shall have the right to demand that any Person reasonably believed by the Board of Directors to be a Holder in Excess (or holder of record of Common Stock beneficially owned by any Holder in Excess) supply the Corporation with complete information as to (i) the record owner(s) of all shares beneficially owned by such Holder in Excess, and (ii) any other factual matter relating to the applicability or effect of this section as may reasonably be requested of such Holder in Excess. The Board of Directors shall further have the right to receive from any Holder in Excess reimbursement for all expenses incurred by the Board in connection with its investigation of any matters relating to the applicability or effect of this section on such Holder in Excess, to the extent such investigation is deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors as a result of the Holder in Excess refusing to supply the Corporation with the information described in the previous sentence.

4. Any constructions, applications, or determinations made by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section D in good faith and on the basis of such information and assistance as was then reasonably available for such purpose, shall be conclusive and binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders.

5. In the event any provision (or portion thereof) of this Section D shall be found to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions (or portions thereof) of this Section D shall remain in full force and effect, and shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision had been stricken herefrom or otherwise rendered inapplicable, it being the intent of the Corporation and its stockholders that each such remaining provision (or portion thereof) of this Section D remain, to the fullest extent permitted by law, applicable and enforceable as to all stockholders, including Holders in Excess, notwithstanding any such finding.

E. Majority Vote. Pursuant to Section 2-104(b)(5) of the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), notwithstanding any provision of the MGCL requiring stockholder authorization of an action by a greater proportion than a

5

* * *

  


majority of the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock or of the total number of shares of any class of capital stock, such action shall be valid and effective if authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of all classes outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, except as otherwise specified in these Articles.

F. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or expressly provided in these Articles, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitling the holders thereof to cast a majority of the votes (after giving effect, if required, to the provisions of Article 5, Section D) entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders, and every reference in these Articles to a majority or other proportion of capital stock (or the holders thereof) for purposes of determining any quorum requirement or any requirement for stockholder consent or approval shall be deemed to refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes (or the holders thereof) then entitled to be cast in respect of such capital stock.

G. Liquidation Account. Under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Corporation must establish and maintain a liquidation account (the “Liquidation Account”) for the benefit of certain Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders as defined in the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization of Equitable Financial Corp., as may be amended from time to time (the “Plan of Conversion”). In the event of a complete liquidation involving (i) the Corporation or (ii) Equitable Bank, a federally chartered savings association that will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, the Corporation must comply with the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the provisions of the Plan of Conversion with respect to the amount and priorities of each Eligible Account Holder’s and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder’s interests in the Liquidation Account. The interest of an Eligible Account Holder or Supplemental Eligible Account Holder in the Liquidation Account does not entitle such account holder to voting rights.

ARTICLE 6. Preemptive Rights and Appraisal Rights.

A. Preemptive Rights. Except for preemptive rights approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the directors then in office, no holder of the capital stock of the Corporation or series of stock or of options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of any class or series of stock or of other securities of the Corporation shall have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any unissued capital stock of any class or series, or any unissued bonds, certificates of indebtedness, debentures or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of any class or series or carrying any right to purchase stock of any class or series.

B. Appraisal Rights. Holders of shares of stock shall not be entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL or any successor statute unless the Board of Directors, pursuant to

6

* * *

  


a resolution approved by a majority of the directors then in office, shall determine that such rights apply with respect to all or any classes or series of stock, to one or more transactions occurring after the date of such determination in connection with which holders of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights.

ARTICLE 7. Directors. The following provisions are made a part of these Articles for the management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:

A. Management of the Corporation. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. All powers of the Corporation may be exercised by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, except as conferred on or as reserved to the stockholders by law or by these Articles or the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that any limitations on the Board of Director’s management or direction of the affairs of the Corporation shall reserve the directors’ full power to discharge their fiduciary duties.

B. Number, Class and Terms of Directors; No Cumulative Voting. The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall initially be nine (9), which number may be increased or decreased in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that such number shall never be less than the minimum number of directors required by the MGCL now or hereafter in force. The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, shall be divided into three classes, with the term of office of the first class (“Class I”) to expire at the conclusion of the first annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the second class (“Class II”) to expire at the conclusion of the annual meeting of stockholders one year thereafter and the term of office of the third class (“Class III”) to expire at the conclusion of the annual meeting of stockholders two years thereafter, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election or for such shorter period of time as the Board of Directors may determine, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (after giving effect to the provisions of Article 5 hereof) voting together as a single class.

E. Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors.

ARTICLE 8. Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by these Articles, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (after giving effect to the provisions of Article 5 hereof), voting together as a single class, shall be required for the adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders.

ARTICLE 9. Evaluation of Certain Offers. The Board of Directors, when evaluating (i) any offer of another Person (as defined below) to (A) make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security of the Corporation, (B) merge or consolidate

8

* * *

  


the Corporation with another corporation or entity, or (C) purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation or (ii) any other actual or proposed transaction that would or may involve a change in control of the Corporation (whether by purchases of shares of stock or any other securities of the Corporation in the open market or otherwise, tender offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, proxy solicitation or otherwise), may, in connection with the exercise of its business judgment in determining what is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders and in making any recommendation to the Corporation’s stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, but not limited to: (A) the economic effect, both immediate and long-term, upon the Corporation’s stockholders, including stockholders, if any, who do not participate in the transaction; (B) the social and economic effect on the present and future employees, creditors and customers of, and others dealing with, the Corporation and its subsidiaries and on the communities in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries operate or are located; (C) whether the proposal is acceptable based on the historical, current or projected future operating results or financial condition of the Corporation; (D) whether a more favorable price could be obtained for the Corporation’s stock or other securities in the future; (E) the reputation and business practices of the other entity to be involved in the transaction and its management and affiliates as they would affect the employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries; (F) the future value of the stock or any other securities of the Corporation or the other entity to be involved in the proposed transaction; (G) any antitrust or other legal and regulatory issues that are raised by the proposal; (H) the business and historical, current or expected future financial condition or operating results of the other entity to be involved in the transaction, including, but not limited to, debt service and other existing financial obligations, financial obligations to be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, and other likely financial obligations of the other entity to be involved in the proposed transaction; and (I) the ability of the Corporation to fulfill its objectives as a financial institution holding company and on the ability of its subsidiary financial institution(s) to fulfill the objectives of a federally insured financial institution under applicable statutes and regulations. If the Board of Directors determines that any proposed transaction of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence should be rejected, it may take any lawful action to defeat such transaction, including, but not limited to, any or all of the following: advising stockholders not to accept the proposal; instituting litigation against the party making the proposal; filing complaints with governmental and regulatory authorities; acquiring the stock or any of the securities of the Corporation; selling or otherwise issuing authorized but unissued stock or other securities or granting options or rights with respect thereto; and obtaining a more favorable offer from another individual or entity. This Article 9 sets forth certain factors that may be considered by the Board of Directors, but does not create any implication concerning the factors that must be considered, or any other factors that may or may not be considered, by the Board of Directors regarding any proposed transaction of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this Article 9.

For purposes of this Article 9, a “Person” shall include an individual, a group acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint venture, a pool, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a syndicate or any other group or entity formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities.

ARTICLE 10. Indemnification, etc. of Directors and Officers.

A. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify (1) its current and former directors and officers, whether serving the Corporation or at its request any other entity, to the fullest extent required or permitted by the MGCL now or hereafter in force, and (2) other employees and agents to such extent as shall be authorized by the Board of Directors and permitted by law; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section B of this Article 10 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred herein shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

B. Procedure. If a claim under Section A of this Article 10 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall also be entitled to be reimbursed the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. It shall be a defense to any action for advancement of expenses that the Corporation has not received both (i) an undertaking as required by law to repay such advances in the event it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met and (ii) a written affirmation by the indemnitee of his good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation has been met. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the MGCL. Further, in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the MGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of

10

* * *

conduct set forth in the MGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article 10 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

C. Non-Exclusivity. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, these Articles, the Corporation’s Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or the Board of Directors, or otherwise.

D. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to insure itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such Person against such expense, liability or loss under the MGCL.

E. Miscellaneous. The Corporation shall not be liable for any payment under this Article 10 in connection with a claim made by any indemnitee to the extent such indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment under any insurance policy, agreement, or otherwise, of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections A and B of this Article 10 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators.

F. Limitations Imposed by Federal Law. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Article 10, in no event shall any payments made by the Corporation pursuant to this Article 10 exceed the amount permissible under applicable federal law, including, without limitation, Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Any repeal or modification of this Article 10 shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to events occurring, or claims made, while this Article 10 is in force.

ARTICLE 11. Limitation of Liability. An officer or director of the Corporation, as such, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for money damages, except (A) to the extent that it is proved that the Person actually

11

* * *

  


received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, for the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually received; or (B) to the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the Person is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding that the Person’s action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding; or (C) to the extent otherwise provided by the MGCL. If the MGCL is amended to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of officers and directors, then the liability of officers and directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL, as so amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE 12. Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in these Articles in the manner prescribed by the MGCL, including any amendment altering the terms or contract rights, as expressly set forth in these Articles, of any of the Corporation’s outstanding stock by classification, reclassification or otherwise, and no stockholder approval shall be required if the approval of stockholders is not required for the proposed amendment or repeal by the MGCL, and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation.

The Board of Directors, pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the Whole Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and without action by the stockholders, may amend these Articles to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue.

No proposed amendment or repeal of any provision of these Articles shall be submitted to a stockholder vote unless the Board of Directors shall have (1) approved the proposed amendment or repeal, (2) determined that it is advisable, and (3) directed that it be submitted for consideration at either an annual or special meeting of the stockholders pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors. Any proposed amendment or repeal of any provision of these Articles may be abandoned by the Board of Directors at any time before its effective time upon the adoption of a resolution approved by a majority of the Whole Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The amendment or repeal of any provision of these Articles shall be approved by at least two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter (after giving due effect to the provisions of Article 5 of these Articles), except that the proposed amendment or repeal of any provision of these Articles need only be approved by the vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter (after giving due effect to the provisions of Article 5 of these Articles) if the amendment or

12

* * *

  


repeal of such provision is approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by at least two-thirds of the Whole Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by these Articles, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (after giving effect to the provisions of Article 5), voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal this Article 12, Section C, D, E or F of Article 5, Article 7 (other than the removal of the list of the original directors), Article 8, Article 9, Article 10 or Article 11.

ARTICLE 13. Name and Address of Incorporator. The name and mailing address of the sole incorporator are as follows:
