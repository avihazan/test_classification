2.4 Expense Reimbursement. Reach Messaging will pay directly or advance funds to or reimburse Executive for reasonable travel and other business expenses incurred by him in connection with the performance of services under this Agreement in accordance with Reach Messaging’ general policies applicable to its other senior executives, as those policies may be amended from time to time, upon presentation of expense statements or vouchers or such other supporting information as Reach Messaging may reasonably request.

  


3\. Term and Termination of Employment

  


3.1 Term. The initial term of Executive’s employment will be for one year from the Effective Date. Unless Reach Messaging gives written notice to Executive not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the employment term, commencing on the date six months prior to such scheduled expiration, the duration of the employment term shall be extended an additional day for each day that passes, so that at any time, unless Reach Messaging has given written notice of termination, there will be not less than six months remaining in the employment term.

  


3.2 Early Termination Without Cause. Notwithstanding Section 3.1, Reach Messaging may terminate employment under this Agreement at any time, without Cause, provided that it continues nonetheless to compensate Executive for a period of six months following such termination, with salary and benefits under Sections 2.1 and 2.3. Executive shall also be entitled to reimbursement of otherwise allowable expenses incurred or committed prior to the date of termination.

  


3.3 Early Termination With Cause. Notwithstanding Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, Reach Messaging may terminate employment under this Agreement at any time, for Cause, in which case Executive shall be entitled to no additional cash compensation other than salary and vacation pay accrued through the date of termination, and reimbursement of otherwise allowable expenses incurred or committed prior to the date of termination.

  


3.4 Death. The term of employment created by this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the death of Executive. Upon termination due to death, Reach Messaging shall pay to Executive’s devisee, legatee, or if there is no such designee, to his estate, the salary, vacation pay and expense reimbursement accrued prior to death and the base pay and (to the extent eligible) benefits under Sections 2.1 and 2.3 that would have been payable for a period of six months following death. The devisee, legatee, or estate shall also be entitled to reimbursement of otherwise allowable expenses incurred or committed prior to the date of death.
