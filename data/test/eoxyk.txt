Section 10. Termination. (a) Notwithstanding the termination of Employee’s employment pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the parties shall be required to carry out any provisions of this Agreement which contemplate performance by them subsequent to such termination. In addition, no termination shall affect any liability or other obligation of either party which shall have accrued prior to such termination, including, but not limited to, any liability, loss or damage on account of breach. No termination of employment shall terminate the obligation of the Corporation to make payments of any vested benefits provided hereunder or the obligations of Employee under Sections 11,12 and 13. 

(b) Employee’s employment hereunder may be terminated by Employee upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Corporation or at any time by mutual agreement in writing. 

(c) This Agreement shall terminate upon death of Employee; provided, however, that in such event the Corporation shall pay to the estate of Employee the compensation including salary and accrued bonus, if any, which otherwise would be payable to Employee through the end of the month in which his death occurs. 

(d)(1) The Corporation may terminate Employee’s employment other than for “Cause”, as defined in Section 10(e), at any time upon written notice to Employee, which termination shall be effective immediately. Employee may resign thirty (30) days after notice to the Corporation for “Good Reason”, as hereafter defined. In the event the Employee’s employment terminates pursuant to this Section 10(d), Employee shall receive a monthly amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) his rate of annual base salary in effect immediately preceding such termination (“Termination Compensation”) in each month for the remainder of the term of this Agreement. Payments of the Termination Compensation shall be made at the times such payments would have been made in accordance with Section 4(a). 

(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

(i) If Employee breaches Section 11 or 12, Employee will not thereafter be entitled to receive any further compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 10(d); and 

(ii) If, while he is receiving payments under this Section 10(d), Employee engages in a Competitive Business within the area described in Section 12(i), such payments will cease and he will not thereafter be entitled to receive any compensation or benefits pursuant to this Section 10(d) even though such conduct occurs after the covenants contained in Section 12 have expired. 

(3) The Corporation shall not be required to make payment of the Termination Compensation or any portion thereof to the extent such payment is prohibited by the terms of the regulations presently found at 12 C.F.R. part 359 or to the extent that any other governmental approval of the payment required by law is not received.

* * *

(4) Except as set forth in Sections 10(d)(2) and 10(d)(3), the Corporation’s obligation to pay the Employee the compensation provided in Section 10(d)(l) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Corporation may have against him or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Corporation hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand. Each and every payment made hereunder by the Corporation shall be final and the Corporation will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Employee or from whosoever may be entitled thereto, for any reason whatsoever. The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. 

(5) For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean: 

(i) The assignment of duties to the Employee by the Corporation which result in the Employee having materially less authority or responsibility than he has on the date hereof, without his express written consent; 

(ii) Requiring the Employee to maintain his principal office outside of Essex County, Virginia unless the Corporation moves its operations center to a place to which the Employee is required to move; 

(iii) A material reduction by the Corporation of the Employee’s base salary, as the same may have been increased from time to time; or 

(iv) The Corporation’s failure to comply with any material term of this Agreement. 

The Employee is required to provide notice to the Company of the existing of a condition above within a 90 day period of the initial existence of the condition, upon the notice of which the Company shall have 30 days to remedy the condition without having to pay the amounts described in this section. 

(e) The Corporation shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement at any time for Cause, which termination shall be effective immediately. Termination for “Cause” shall include termination for Employee’s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of a fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, conviction of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, misappropriation of the Corporation’s assets (determined on a reasonable basis) or those of its Affiliates, or material breach of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event Employee’s employment under this Agreement is terminated for Cause, Employee shall thereafter have no right to receive compensation or other benefits under this Agreement.

(f) The Corporation may terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement, after having established the Employee’s disability by giving to Employee written notice of its intention to terminate his employment for disability and his employment with the Corporation shall terminate effective on the 90th day after receipt of such notice if within 90 days after such receipt Employee shall fail to return to the full-time performance of the essential functions of his position (and if Employee’s disability has been established pursuant to the definition of “disability” set forth below). For purposes of this Agreement, “disability” means either (i) disability which after the expiration of more than 13 consecutive weeks after its commencement is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected and paid for by the Corporation or its insurers, and acceptable to Employee or his legal representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or (ii) disability as defined in the policy of disability insurance maintained by the Corporation or its Affiliates for the benefit of Employee, whichever shall be more favorable to Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation shall comply with all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq. 

(g) If Employee is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Corporation’s affairs by a notice served pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Corporation’s obligations under this Employment Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Corporation may in its discretion (i) pay Employee all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended, and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were suspended. 

(h) If Employee is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Corporation’s affairs by an order issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the Code of Virginia, all obligations of the Corporation under this Employment Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the parties shall not be affected. 

(i)(l) If Employee’s employment is terminated without Cause or if he resigns for Good Reason within one year after a Change of Control shall have occurred, then on or before Employee’s last day of employment with the Corporation, the Corporation shall pay to Employee as compensation for services rendered to the Corporation and its Affiliates a cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld) equal to the excess, if any, of 299% of Employee’s “annualized includable compensation for the base period”, as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), over the total amount payable to Employee under Section 10(d), provided, however, if Employee is a Specified Employee (as defined below) on his Separation from Service (as defined below), payments under this section shall be delayed for six months. Such payments shall be accumulated and paid with interest on the first day of the seventh month following such Employee’s Separation from Service. The amount of interest paid shall be based on the prime rate of interest in effect on the first day of the month following his Separation from Service as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Specified Employee means an Employee who on the date of his Separation from Service is a Key Employee of the Corporation provided that the Corporation is publicly traded on an established securities market. The Corporation shall determine the Employees who are Key Employees on the Specified Employee Identification Date. Any Employee who is a Key 

5 

* * *

Employee on the Specified Employee Identification Date shall be treated as a Key Employee for the entire 12 month period beginning on the Specified Employee Effective Date. Separation from Service means either: (i) the complete cessation of the performance of services by the Employee for the Corporation for whatever reason, or (ii) a diminished level of services where the Employee is expected to perform services at a level equal to 20% or less of the average level of service provided during the immediately preceding 36 months. Key Employee means an Employee who meets the requirements of Code section 416(i)(l)(A)(i), (ii), or (iii) applied in accordance with the regulations thereunder and disregarding Code section 416(i)(5). Compensation for purposes of identifying the Key Employee defined according to Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2)(a) applied without regard to the safe harbor provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(d), and the special timing rules provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(e), and the special rules provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(g). 

(2) For purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control occurs if, after the date of this Agreement, (i) any person, including a “group” as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, becomes the owner or beneficial owner of Corporation securities having 50% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding Corporation securities that may be cast for the election of the Corporation’s directors other than a result of an issuance of securities initiated by the Corporation, or open market purchases approved by the Board of Directors, as long as the majority of the Board of Directors approving the purchases is a majority at the time the purchases are made; or (ii) as the direct or indirect result of, or in connection with, a tender or exchange offer, a merger or other business combination, a sale of assets, a contested election of directors, or any combination of these events, the persons who were directors of the Corporation before such events cease to constitute a majority of the Corporation’s Board, or any successor’s board, within two years of the last of such transactions. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control occurs on the date on which an event described in (i) or (ii) occurs. If a Change of Control occurs on account of a series of transactions or events, the Change of Control occurs on the date of the last of such transactions or events. 

(3) It is the intention of the parties that no payment be made or benefit provided to Employee pursuant to this Agreement that would constitute an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and any regulations thereunder, thereby resulting in a loss of an income tax deduction by the Corporation or the imposition of an excise tax on Employee under Section 4999 of the Code. If the independent accountants serving as auditors for the Corporation on the date of a Change of Control (or any other accounting firm designated by the Corporation) determine that some or all of the payments or benefits scheduled under this Agreement, as well as any other payments or benefits on a Change of Control, would be nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G of the Code, then the payments scheduled under this Agreement will be reduced to one dollar less than the maximum amount which may be paid without causing any such payment or benefit to be nondeductible. The determination made as to the reduction of benefits or payments required hereunder by the independent accountants shall be binding on the parties. Employee shall have the right to designate within a reasonable period, which payments or benefits will be reduced; provided, however, that if no direction is received from Employee, the Corporation shall implement the reductions in its discretion.

Section 11. Confidentiality/Nondisclosure. Employee covenants and agrees that any and all information concerning the customers, businesses and services of the Corporation of which he has knowledge or access as a result of his association with the Corporation in any capacity, shall be deemed confidential in nature and shall not, without the proper written consent of the Corporation, be directly or indirectly used, disseminated, disclosed or published by Employee to third parties other than in connection with the usual conduct of the business of the Corporation. Such information shall expressly include, but shall not be limited to, information concerning the Corporation’s trade secrets, business operations, business records, customer lists or other customer information. Upon termination of employment Employee shall deliver to the Corporation all originals and copies of documents, forms, records or other information, in whatever form ,it may exist, concerning the Corporation or its business, customers, products or services. In construing this provision it is agreed that it shall be interpreted broadly so as to provide the Corporation with the maximum protection. This Section 11 shall not be applicable to any information which, through no misconduct or negligence of Employee, has previously been disclosed to the public by anyone other than Employee. 

Section 12. Covenant Not to Compete. During the term of this Agreement and throughout any further period that he is an officer or employee of the Corporation, and for a period of twelve (12) months from and after the date that Employee is (for any reason) no longer employed by the Corporation or for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of a final judgment enforcing this covenant in the event of a breach by Employee, whichever is later, Employee covenants and agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, either as a principal, agent, employee, employer, stockholder, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever: (i) engage in a Competitive Business anywhere within a ten (10) mile radius of the location of the Corporation’s principal executive offices on the date Employee’s employment terminates; or (ii) solicit, or assist any other person or business entity in soliciting, any depositors or other customers of the Corporation to make deposits in or to become customers of any other financial institution conducting a Competitive Business; or (iii) induce any individuals to terminate their employment with the Corporation or its Affiliates. As used in this Agreement, the term “Competitive Business” means all banking and financial products and services that are substantially similar to those offered by the Corporation on the date that Employee’s employment terminates. Employee’s obligations under this Section 12 shall terminate on the date a Change of Control occurs. 

Section 13. Injunctive Relief Damages, Etc. Employee agrees that given the nature of the positions held by Employee with the Corporation, that each and every one of the covenants and restrictions set forth in Sections 11 and 12 above are reasonable in scope, length of time and geographic area and are necessary for the protection of the significant investment of the Corporation in developing, maintaining and expanding its business. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that in the event of any breach by Employee of any of the provisions of Sections 11 or 12 that monetary damages alone will not adequately compensate the Corporation for its losses and, therefore, that it may seek any and all legal or equitable relief available to it, specifically including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and Employee shall be liable for all damages, including actual and 

7 

* * *

consequential damages, costs and expenses, including legal costs and actual attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Corporation as a result of taking action to enforce, or recover for any breach of, Section 11 or Section 12. The covenants contained in Sections 11 and 12 shall be construed and interpreted in any judicial proceeding to permit their enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that any provision of the covenants and restrictions set forth in Section 12 above is unenforceable as being overbroad as to time, area or scope, the court may strike the offending provision or reform such provision to substitute such other terms as are reasonable to protect the Corporation’s legitimate business interests. 

Section 14. Binding Effect/Assignability. This Employment Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Corporation and Employee and their respective heirs, legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, but neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights hereunder, shall be assignable by Employee or any beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by Employee. The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of the Corporation, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in its entirety. Failure of the Corporation to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, “Corporation” shall include any successor to its business, stock or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 14 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. 

Section 15. Governing Law. This Employment Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of Virginia. 

Section 16. Invalid Provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Employment Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions hereof, and this Employment Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provisions were omitted. 

Section 17. Notices. Any and all notices, designations, consents, offers, acceptance or any other communications provided for herein shall be given in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered if delivered in person or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed in the case of the Corporation to its registered office or in the case of Employee to his last known address. 

Section 18. Entire Agreement.

(a) This Employment Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all other agreements, either oral or in writing, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

(b) This Employment Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original copy of this Agreement, but all of which together shall evidence only one agreement.
