Exhibit A



WHEREAS, this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, which is attached to the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (the “Grant Notice” and this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall be referred to collectively as the “Agreement”), has been entered into, effective on the Grant Date specified in the Grant Notice, by and between GrubHub Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the Participant specified in the Grant Notice, pursuant to the GrubHub Inc. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in effect and as amended from time to time (the “Plan”); and

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company to grant the Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) provided herein to the Participant, subject to the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and all other terms and conditions set forth under the Plan and this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:

1.Incorporation By Reference; Plan Document Receipt. This Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly intended not to apply to the Award provided hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part of and incorporated into this Agreement as if they were each expressly set forth herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as is ascribed thereto in the Plan. The Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a true copy of the Plan and also acknowledges that the Participant has read the Plan carefully and fully understands its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.

2.Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award. The Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of the Grant Date specified in the Grant Notice, the number of RSUs specified in the Grant Notice. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan, the Participant agrees and understands that nothing contained in this Agreement provides, or is intended to provide, the Participant with any protection against potential future dilution of the Participant’s interest in the Company for any reason, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement.

3.Vesting.

(a)Subject to the provisions of Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof, the RSUs subject to this Award shall become vested as set forth in the Grant Notice, provided that the Participant has not incurred a Termination prior to each such vesting date. There shall be no proportionate or partial vesting in the periods prior to each vesting date and all vesting shall

Exhibit A

occur only on the appropriate vesting date, subject to the Participant’s continued service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on each applicable vesting date.

(b)Committee Discretion to Accelerate Vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for accelerated vesting of the RSUs at any time and for any reason. 

(c)Change in Control. If within the period beginning 45 days prior to and ending 12 months after the occurrence of a Change in Control, Participant’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or Participant terminates his/her employment for Good Reason, then 100% of any then-unvested RSUs granted hereunder shall immediately accelerate and become fully vested and the Participant shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that correspond to the number of RSUs that vested or, at the option of the Committee, cash of equivalent value. “Good Reason” shall mean that the Participant has complied with the Good Reason Process (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any one or more of the following events without the consent of the Participant: (i) a diminution in the Participant’s base salary of greater than ten percent (10%) (in all cases, other than in connection with a diminution in base salary that is proportionately applied to all senior executives of the Company); (ii) a change in the geographic location at which the Participant provides services to the Company by more than fifty (50) miles (provided that moving the Company’s corporate headquarters shall not constitute a change in geographic location, so long as the Participant continues to be able to provide services to the Company from a location not more than fifty (50) miles from Chicago or New York, as applicable); or (iii) a material diminution of the Participant’s title or reporting relationship. “Good Reason Process” shall mean that (1) the Participant reasonably determines in good faith that a “Good Reason” condition has occurred; (2) the Participant notifies the Company in writing of the first occurrence of the Good Reason condition within thirty (30) days after the first occurrence of such condition; (3) the Participant cooperates in good faith with the Company’s efforts, for a period of thirty (30) days following such notice (the “Cure Period”) to remedy the condition; (4) the Good Reason condition continues to exist following the Cure Period; and (5) the Participant terminates employment with the Company within thirty (30) days after the end of the Cure Period. If the Company cures the Good Reason condition during the Cure Period, Good Reason will be deemed not to have occurred.

(d)Forfeiture. Subject to the Committee’s discretion to accelerate vesting hereunder and except as set forth in Section 3(c) hereof, all unvested RSUs shall be immediately forfeited upon the Participant’s Termination for any reason.

4.Delivery of Shares.

(a)General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 4(b) and 4(c) hereof, within thirty (30) days following the vesting of the RSUs, the Participant shall receive the number of shares of Common Stock that correspond to the number of RSUs that have become vested on the applicable vesting date.

(b)Blackout Periods. If the Participant is subject to any Company “blackout” policy or other trading restriction imposed by the Company on the date such distribution would

* * *

Exhibit A

otherwise be made pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof, such distribution shall be instead made on the earlier of (i) the date that the Participant is not subject to any such policy or restriction and (ii) the later of (A) the end of the calendar year in which such distribution would otherwise have been made and (B) a date that is immediately prior to the expiration of two and one-half months following the date such distribution would otherwise have been made hereunder.

(c)Deferrals. If permitted by the Company, the Participant may elect, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and any other applicable written plan or procedure adopted by the Company from time to time for purposes of such election, to defer the distribution of all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be distributed to the Participant hereunder (the “Deferred Shares”), consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Upon the vesting of RSUs that have been so deferred, the applicable number of Deferred Shares shall be credited to a bookkeeping account established on the Participant’s behalf (the “Account”). Subject to Section 5 hereof, the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Deferred Shares credited to the Participant’s Account shall be distributed to the Participant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and the other applicable written plans or procedures of the Company, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

5.Dividends; Rights as Stockholder. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder, and shall not receive payment of, or credit for, dividends or dividend equivalents, with respect to any shares of Common Stock covered by any RSU unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares.

6.Non-Transferability. The RSUs granted under this Agreement and the Plan, and any rights and interests with respect thereto, shall not be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant (or any beneficiary of the Participant), other than by testamentary disposition by the Participant or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit the RSUs to be Transferred to a Family Member for no value, provided that such Transfer shall only be valid upon execution of a written instrument in form and substance acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion evidencing such Transfer and the transferee’s acceptance thereof, signed by the Participant and the transferee, and provided further that the RSUs may not be subsequently Transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or to another Family Member (as permitted by the Committee in its sole discretion) in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, and shall in any event at all times remain subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. Any attempt to sell, exchange, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate in any way the RSUs, or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar legal process upon the RSUs, contrary to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and/or the Plan shall be null and void and without legal force or effect.

7.Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law principles thereof.

8.Withholding of Tax. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require the Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, local and foreign taxes of any kind (including, but not limited to, the Participant’s FICA and SDI obligations) which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to be withheld or remitted to comply with the Code and/or any other applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to the RSUs and, if the Participant fails to do so, the Company may otherwise refuse to issue or transfer any shares of Common Stock otherwise required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement. Any minimum statutorily required withholding obligation with regard to the Participant may be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash or shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant hereunder.

9.Securities Representations. This Agreement is being entered into by the Company in reliance upon the following express representations and warranties of the Participant. The Participant hereby acknowledges, represents and warrants that:

(a)The Participant has been advised that the Participant may be an “affiliate” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and in this connection, the Company is relying in part on the Participant’s representations set forth in this Section 9.

(b)If the Participant is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder must be held indefinitely unless an exemption from any applicable resale restrictions is available or the Company files an additional registration statement (or a “re-offer prospectus”) with regard to such shares of Common Stock. For clarity, the Company is under no obligation to register such shares of Common Stock (or to file a “re-offer prospectus”).

(c)If the Participant is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the Participant understands that: (i) the exemption from registration under Rule 144 will not be available unless (A) a public trading market then exists for the Common Stock of the Company, (B) adequate information concerning the Company is then available to the public, and (C) other terms and conditions of Rule 144 or any exemption therefrom are complied with; and (ii) any sale of the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder may be made only in limited amounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of Rule 144 or any exemption therefrom.

10.Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement, together with the Plan, contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements or prior understandings, whether written or oral, between the parties relating to such subject matter. The Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or amend this Agreement from time to time in accordance with and as provided in the Plan. This Agreement may also be modified or amended by a writing signed by both the Company and the Participant. The Company shall give written notice to the Participant of any such modification or amendment of this Agreement as soon as practicable after the adoption thereof.

Exhibit A

thereof by the General Counsel of the Company. Any notice hereunder by the Company shall be given to the Participant in writing or electronically and such notice shall be deemed duly given only upon receipt thereof at such address/email address as the Participant may have on file with the Company.

12.No Right to Employment. Any questions as to whether and when there has been a Termination and the cause of such Termination shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates to terminate the Participant’s employment or service at any time, for any reason and with or without Cause.

13.Transfer of Personal Data. The Participant authorizes, agrees and unambiguously consents to the transmission by the Company (or any Subsidiary) of any personal data information related to the RSUs awarded under this Agreement for legitimate business purposes (including, without limitation, the administration of the Plan). This authorization and consent is freely given by the Participant.

14.Compliance with Laws. The grant of RSUs (and the issuance of shares of Common Stock) pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to, and shall comply with, any applicable requirements of any foreign and U.S. federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and in each case any respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation or exchange requirement applicable thereto. The Company shall not be obligated to issue the RSUs or any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement if any such issuance would violate any such requirements. As a condition to the settlement of the RSUs, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation.

15.Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Plan to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements for avoiding additional taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

16.Binding Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be binding upon, and be enforceable by the Company and its successors and assigns.
