RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT  
  
Restricted Stock/ Nontransferability

This grant is an award of Stock in the number of shares set forth on the cover sheet, at the purchase price set forth on the cover sheet, and subject to the vesting conditions described below (“Restricted Stock”). The purchase price is deemed paid by your prior services to the Company. To the extent not yet vested, your Restricted Stock may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor may the Restricted Stock be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  
  
Vesting

The Company will issue your Restricted Stock in your name as of the Grant Date.  
  
[Your right to the Stock under this Restricted Stock Agreement vests as to one-fourth (1/4th) of the total number of shares of Stock covered by this grant, as shown on the cover sheet, on each of the first four one-year anniversaries of the Grant Date (each an “Anniversary Date”), provided you then continue in Service.] If, however, such Anniversary Date occurs during a period in which you are (i) subject to a lock-up agreement restricting your ability to sell shares of Stock in the open market or (ii) restricted from selling shares of Stock in the open market because you are not then eligible to sell under the Company’s insider trading or similar plan as then in effect (whether because a trading window is not open or you are otherwise restricted from trading), vesting in such shares of Stock will be delayed until the earlier of (A) first date on which you are no longer prohibited from selling shares of Stock due to a lock-up agreement or insider trading plan restriction (the “Vesting Date”), and (B) the date of your death or Disability, but in no event beyond 2 1/2 months after the end of the year in which the shares would have otherwise been vested, and provided, further, that you have been continuously in Service to the Company or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date until the Vesting Date. The resulting aggregate number of vested shares of Stock will be rounded to the nearest whole number, and you cannot vest in more than the number of shares covered by this grant.  
  
No additional shares of Stock will vest after your Service has terminated for any reason.

#####   
  
Forfeiture of Unvested Stock

In the event that your Service terminates for any reason, you will forfeit to the Company all of the shares of Stock subject to this grant that have not yet vested or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed.  
  
Death

If your Service terminates because of your death, then you will forfeit to the Company all of the shares of Stock subject to this grant that have not yet vested or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed.  
  
Disability

If your Service terminates because of your Disability, then you will forfeit to the Company all of the shares of Stock subject to this grant that have not yet vested or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed.  
  
Issuance

The issuance of the Stock under this grant shall be evidenced in such a manner as the Company, in its discretion, will deem appropriate, including, without limitation, book-entry, registration or issuance of one or more Stock certificates, with any unvested Restricted Stock bearing a legend with the appropriate restrictions imposed by this Agreement. As your interest in the Stock vests as described above, the recordation of the number of shares of Restricted Stock attributable to you will be appropriately modified.  
  
Section 83(b) Election

If you are U.S. Grantee, under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the difference between the purchase price paid for the shares of Stock and their fair market value on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such shares lapse will be reportable as ordinary income at that time. For this purpose, “forfeiture restrictions” include the forfeiture as to unvested Stock described above. You may elect to be taxed at the time the shares are acquired, rather than when such shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date. You will have to make a tax payment to the extent the purchase price is less than the fair market value of the shares on the Grant Date. No tax payment will have to be made to the extent the purchase price is at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the Grant Date. The form for making this election is attached as Exhibit A hereto. Failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by you (in the event the fair market value of the shares as of the vesting date exceeds the purchase price) as the forfeiture restrictions lapse.

#####   
  
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY’S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF YOU REQUEST THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON YOUR BEHALF. YOU ARE RELYING SOLELY ON YOUR OWN ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE ANY 83(b) ELECTION.  
  
Corporate Transaction

Notwithstanding the vesting schedule set forth above, upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, this award will become 100% vested if it is not assumed, or equivalent awards are not substituted for the award, by the Company or its successor. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if assumed or substituted for, the option will expire one year after the date of termination.  
  
Retention Rights

This Agreement does not give you the right to be retained by the Company (or any parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates) in any capacity. The Company (and any parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates) reserve the right to terminate your Service at any time and for any reason.  
  
Shareholder Rights

You have the right to vote the Restricted Stock and to receive any dividends declared or paid on such stock. Any distributions you receive as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares or other similar transaction shall be deemed to be a part of the Restricted Stock and subject to the same conditions and restrictions applicable thereto. The Company may in its sole discretion require any dividends paid on the Restricted Stock to be reinvested in shares of Stock, which the Company may in its sole discretion deem to be a part of the shares of Restricted Stock and subject to the same conditions and restrictions applicable thereto. Except as described in the Plan, no adjustments are made for dividends or other rights if the applicable record date occurs before your stock certificate is issued.  
  
Forfeiture of Rights

If you should take actions in competition with the Company, the Company shall have the right to cause a forfeiture of your unvested Restricted Stock, and with respect to those shares of Restricted Stock vesting during the period commencing twelve (12) months prior to your termination of Service with the Company due to taking actions in competition with the Company, the right to cause a forfeiture of those vested shares of Stock.

If it is ever determined by the Board that your actions have constituted wrongdoing that contributed to any material misstatement or omission from any report or statement filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, gross misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty to the Company, or fraud, then the Restricted Stock shall be immediately forfeited; provided, however, that if the Restricted Stock has vested within two years prior to the Board of Directors determination, you shall be required to pay to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate value of the shares acquired upon such vesting at the date of the Board determination.  
  
Adjustments

In the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in the Stock, the number of shares covered by this grant may be adjusted (and rounded down to the nearest whole number) pursuant to the Plan. Your Restricted Stock shall be subject to the terms of the agreement of merger, liquidation or reorganization in the event the Company is subject to such corporate activity in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
