3.2. Purchase Entirely for Own Account. This Agreement is made with Purchaser in reliance upon Purchaser’s representation to the Company, which by Purchaser’s execution of this Agreement, Purchaser hereby confirms, that the Shares to be acquired by Purchaser will be acquired for investment for Purchaser’s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and that Purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. By executing this Agreement, Purchaser further represents that Purchaser does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to any of the Shares.

3.4. Restricted Securities. Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Purchaser’s representations as expressed herein. Purchaser understands that the Shares are “restricted securities” under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, Purchaser must hold the Shares indefinitely unless they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Shares for resale. Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Shares, and on requirements relating to the Company which are outside of Purchaser’s control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy.

3.5. No Public Market. Purchaser understands that no public market now exists for the Shares, and that the Company has made no assurances that a public market will ever exist for the Shares.

3.6. Legends. Purchaser understands that the Shares and any securities issued in respect of or in exchange for the Shares, may bear one or all of the following legends:

(a) “THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.”
