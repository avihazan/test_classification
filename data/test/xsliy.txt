(c) Notwithstanding paragraph 1(b), the Employers, by action of their Boards of Directors (the “Boards”) and effective as specified in a written notice thereof to the Executive in accordance with the terms hereof, shall have the right to terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder at any time during the Term hereof for Cause (as defined herein) or other than for Cause or on account of the Executive’s death or Permanent Disability (as defined herein), subject to the provisions of this paragraph 1.

In the event of a termination of the Executive’s employment pursuant to this paragraph 1(e)(iv) that is within a Change in Control Period, the Employers shall pay the Executive, provided the Executive concurrently signs and delivers to the Employers a general release in a form mutually acceptable to the Employers and the Executive, an amount equal to the sum of (y) the Accrued Obligations and (z) a severance payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of (1) the Executive’s annual Base Salary as of the effective date of termination of the Executive’s employment hereunder and (2) the Incentive Bonus payable to the Executive pursuant to paragraph 3(b)(i) for 2004.
