II. AGREEMENT

1\.  Grant of Option. The Administrator grants to the Optionee named in the Notice of Stock Option Grant in Part I of this Option Agreement, an Option to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Stock Option Grant, at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Stock Option Grant (the “Exercise Price”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan prevail. 

If designated in the Notice of Stock Option Grant as an Incentive Stock Option, this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option as defined in Code section 422. Nevertheless, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code section 422(d), this Option will be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 

2\.  Exercise of Option. 

(a)  Right to Exercise. This Option is exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Stock Option Grant and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. 

(b)  Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable by (i) delivery of an exercise notice in the form attached as Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”) or in a manner and pursuant to procedures as the Administrator may determine, which will state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, and other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company and (ii) paying the Company in full the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Shares being acquired, together with any applicable tax withholding.

-2-

* * *

This Option will be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of a fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by the aggregate Exercise Price, together with any applicable tax withholding.

No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the issuance and exercise of Shares complies with Applicable Laws. Assuming compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares will be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to the Shares.

3\.  Method of Payment. The aggregate Exercise Price may be paid by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee: 

(a)  cash; 

(b)  check;

(c)  promissory note; 

(d)  other Shares, provided Shares have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option will be exercised;

(e)  by asking the Company to withhold Shares from the total Shares to be delivered upon exercise equal to the number of Shares having a value equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares being acquired; 

(f)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

(g)  such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.  


4\.  Restrictions on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised (a) until such time as the Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company, or (b) if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws. The Company will be relieved of any liability with respect to any delayed issuance of shares or its failure to issue shares if such delay or failure is necessary to comply with Applicable Laws. 

5\.  Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement are binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.

* * *

6\.  Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Stock Option Grant, and may be exercised during the term only in accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option. 

7\.  Tax Obligations. 

(a) Withholding Taxes. Optionee agrees to arrange for the satisfaction of all Federal, state, local and foreign income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the Option exercise. Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if withholding amounts are not delivered at the time of exercise. 

(b) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. If the Option granted to Optionee is an ISO, and if Optionee sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to the ISO on or before the later of (i) the date two (2) years after the Grant Date, or (ii) the date one (1) year after the date of exercise, the Optionee must immediately notify the Company of the disposition in writing. Optionee agrees that Optionee may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income recognized by the Optionee.

(c) Code Section 409A. Under Code section 409A, an Option that vests after December 31, 2004 that was granted with a per Share exercise price that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) to be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date (a “discount option”) may be considered deferred compensation. An Option that is a discount option may result in (i) income recognition by the Optionee prior to the exercise of the Option, (ii) an additional twenty percent (20%) tax, and (iii) potential penalty and interest charges. Optionee acknowledges that the Company cannot and has not guaranteed that the IRS will agree that the per Share Exercise Price of this Option equals or exceeds Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date in a later examination. Optionee agrees that if the IRS determines that the Option was granted with a per Share exercise price that was less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, Optionee will be solely responsible for any and all resulting tax consequences.

8\.  No Guarantee of Continued Service. OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING OPTIONEE) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS OPTION OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS OPTION AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH OPTIONEE’S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING OPTIONEE) TO TERMINATE OPTIONEE’S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
