The shares of the capital stock of the corporation are transferable only on the books of the corporation and, if such shares are certificated, upon surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for transfer, and the presentation of such evidences of ownership and validity of the assignment as the corporation may require.

  


3.04 REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS. The corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of stock is registered as the owner thereof for purposes of dividends and other distributions in the course of business, or in the course of recapitalization, consolidation, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, liquidation or otherwise and for the purpose of votes, approvals and consents by shareholders, and for the purpose of notices to shareholders, and for all other purposes whatever, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the corporation shall have notice thereof, save as expressly required by the laws of the State of Michigan.

SHAREHOLDERS AND MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

  


4.01 PLACE OF MEETINGS. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place as shall be determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of meeting.

  


4.02 ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the shareholders of the corporation shall be held on the third Monday of the fourth calendar month after the end of the corporation’s fiscal year at 2 o’clock in the afternoon. Directors shall be elected at each annual meeting and such other business transacted as may come before the meeting.

* * *

  


  


4.03 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board (if such office is filled) or the President and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the written request of shareholders holding a majority of the shares of stock of the corporation outstanding and entitled to vote. The request shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is to be called.

  


4.04. NOTICE OF MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these bylaws (including Article VI, Section 6.01), written notice of each meeting of shareholders, stating the time, place, if any, and purposes thereof, shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date fixed for the meeting, either personally, by mail, or, if authorized by the Board of Directors, by a form of electronic transmission to which the shareholder has consented. For the purposes of these Bylaws, “electronic transmission” means any form of communication that does not directly involve the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained and retrieved by the recipient and that may be reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process. Notice of a meeting need not be given to any shareholder who signs a waiver of notice before or after the meeting. Attendance of a shareholder at a meeting shall constitute both: (a) a waiver of notice or defective notice except when the shareholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to holding the meeting or transacting any business because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened, and (b) a waiver of objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, except when the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

  


4.05 RECORD DATES. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board (if such office is filled) or the President may fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders or an adjournment thereof, or to express consent or to dissent from a proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or allotment of a right, or for the purpose of any other action. The date fixed shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of the meeting, nor more than 60 days before any other action. In such case only such shareholder as shall be shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or adjournment therefor, or to express consent or to dissent from such proposal, or to receive payment of such dividend or to receive such allotment of rights, or to participate in any other action, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation, or otherwise, after any such record date. Nothing in this Bylaw shall affect the rights of a shareholder and his or her transferee or transferor as between themselves.

  


4.06 LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS. The Secretary of the corporation or the agent of the corporation having charge of the stock transfer records for shares of the corporation shall make and certify a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at a shareholders’ meeting or any adjournment thereof. The list shall be arranged alphabetically within each class and series, with the address of, and the number of shares held by, each shareholder; be produced at the time and place of the meeting; be subject to inspection by any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting; and be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine the list or vote at the meeting.

4.07 QUORUM. Unless a greater or lesser quorum is required in the Articles of Incorporation or by the laws of the State of Michigan, the shareholders present at a meeting in person or by proxy who, as of the record date for such meeting, were holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum at the meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of shareholders may be adjourned by a vote of the shares present in person or by proxy. When the holders of a class or series of shares are entitled to vote separately on an item of business, this Bylaw applies in determining the presence of a quorum of such class or series for transaction of such item of business.

  


4.08. PROXIES. A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize one or more other persons to act for him or her by proxy. The following methods constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant authority to another person to act as proxy: (a) The execution of a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the shareholder or by an authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature; and (b) Transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will hold the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or similar agent fully authorized by the person who will hold the proxy to receive that transmission. Any telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder. If a telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is determined to be valid, the inspectors, or, if there are no inspectors, the persons making the determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.

  


4.09 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The Board of Directors, in advance of a shareholders’ meeting, may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at the shareholders’ meeting may, and on request of a shareholder entitled to vote thereat shall, appoint one or more inspectors. In case a person appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat. If appointed, the inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting or a shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make and execute a written report to the person presiding at the meeting of any of the facts found by them and matters determined by them. The report shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as certified by the inspectors.

  


4.10 VOTING. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation. Votes shall be cast in writing, signed by the shareholder or his or her proxy. When an action, other than the election of directors, is to be taken by a vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by 

  


  


  


4

* * *

  


  


the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon, unless a greater plurality is required by the Articles of Incorporation or by the laws of the State of Michigan. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any election.

  


4.11 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws:

The notice by the shareholder must set forth: (i) a brief description of the matter the shareholder desires to present for shareholder action; (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing the matter for shareholder action; (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder; and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in the matter proposed for shareholder action. For purposes of this Section, “public disclosure” means disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or other comparable national financial news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
  
  
  
  
(c)

Except to the extent that a shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to this Section is not made available at the time of mailing, the notice of the purposes of the meeting shall include the name and address of and the number of shares of the voting security held by the proponent of each shareholder proposal.

(d)

Notwithstanding the above, if the shareholder desires to require the corporation to include the shareholder’s proposal in the corporation’s proxy materials, matters and proposals submitted for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials shall be governed by the solicitation rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including without limitation Rule 14a-8.
