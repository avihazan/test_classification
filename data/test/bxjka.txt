RECITALS: 

A. The Bank and the Employee wish to confirm the employment of the Employee by the Bank on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth; and   
  
B. The Bank recognizes the valuable services that the Employee has rendered and desires to be assured that the Employee will continue his active participation in the business of the Bank, subject to the terms of this Agreement, and desires to assure Employee that his employment will continue subject to the terms of this Agreement.   
  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements contained in this Agreement, it is agreed as follows: 

1\. DEFINITIONS. 

As used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires a different meaning, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to the singular and plural forms thereof and words in the masculine gender being deemed to be feminine as may be applicable): 

Board shall mean the Board of Directors of the Bank. 

Cause shall mean any of the following activities by the Employee: (i) the conviction of the Employee for a felony, or a crime involving moral turpitude; (ii) the commission of any act involving dishonesty, disloyalty or fraud with respect to the Bank or any of its members; (iii) willful and continued failure to perform material duties which are reasonably directed by the Board of Directors and/or the President which are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the position specified in Section 2; (iv) gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to the Bank or any of its members; or (v) any violation of Bank policies regarding sexual harassment, discrimination, substance abuse or the Bank’s Code of Ethics to the extent such acts would provide grounds for a termination for cause with respect to other employees; or (vi) a material breach by the Employee of a material provision of this Agreement. 

Change of Control of the Bank shall mean the occurrence at any time of any of the following events:

Form of Employment Agreement  
  
* * *

of the equity securities of the Bank, the acquisition of additional equity securities by the same person or group will not be considered a Change of Control under this Agreement. An increase in the percentage of equity securities of the Bank owned by any person or group as a result of a transaction in which the Bank acquires its own equity securities in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of equity securities of the Bank for purposes of this paragraph; or 

(b) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board (together with (a) any new or replacement directors whose election by the Board, or (b) whose nomination for election by the Bank’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors then in office; or 

(c) The Bank sells or transfers 95% or more of its business and/or assets to another bank or other entity. 

Change in Control Bonus Payment has the meaning given to such term in Section 8(c). 

Disability shall mean that the Employee (a) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months as determined under the Bank’s short- or long-term disability program; or (b) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months as determined under the Bank’s short- or long-term disability program, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering the Bank’s employees. 

Good Reason shall mean any of the following:

(b) the relocation of the Employee’s principal office assignment to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its location on the date hereof; or 

(c) any material breach of this Agreement by the Bank.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason will not exist if the Employee voluntarily agrees in writing to any of the changes listed above giving rise to Good Reason 

Retirement shall mean the planned and voluntary termination by the Employee of his employment on or after reaching the earliest retirement age permitted by the Financial Institutions Retirement Fund. 

FOR SANJAY K. BHASIN AND CHAD A. BRANDT: Term of the Agreement means (2) two years. 

FOR JOHN STOCCHETTI: Term of the Agreement means two (2) years; provided, however, that if at any time during the Term of the Agreement any then-current member of the Bank’s Management Committee is offered an employment agreement having a three-year term, then the Bank agrees that it will enter into an amendment to this Agreement to amend the original Term of the Agreement of this Agreement to be three (3) years. For purposes of clarity, in the event of such an amendment, the entire Term of the Agreement will not exceed three (3) years, regardless of when such amendment is entered into. 

2\. DUTIES OF EMPLOYEE. 

The Employee has been retained by the Bank as a [EMPLOYEE JOB TITLE] or in such other or further capacities as may be assigned by the Bank. The Employee shall devote his best efforts to the performance of his duties of his position with the Bank and shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention to the performance of his duties under this Agreement.

The Bank will review the performance of the Employee and the compensation paid to the Employee according to its existing policies. If the Employee’s base salary is increased as a result of a merit increase or promotion at any time during the term of this Agreement, then such increased amount shall thereafter constitute the Employee’s “base salary” for all purposes under this Agreement. The Bank reserves the right to reduce the compensation of its Employees when such reduction is associated with a “General Reduction” in compensation among employees in the same job grade or employees who are similarly situated and such reduction is in response to adverse or declining economic conditions. Any such reduction shall not exceed 5% of the Employee’s base salary amount in effect at the time of the reduction. The Employee will also be eligible for such incentive compensation plans as are adopted by the Board of Directors. 

5\. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. 

The Employee shall be eligible to participate in or receive benefits that are provided to employees under the Bank’s various employee benefit plans, including applicable bonus plans, if any.

6\. TERMINATION. 

The Employee’s employment under this Agreement may be terminated under the following circumstances: 

(a) Death. Upon the Employee’s death, in which case Employee’s employment will terminate on the date of death;   
  
(b) Disability. Upon the Employee’s Disability, in which case the Employee may be eligible for leave under one or more of the Bank’s medical leave and/or disability plans. If the Employee’s Disability results in the Employee’s inability to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation (as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act), the Employee’s duties under this Agreement, after the initial ninety- (90-) day period of Disability, the Bank may give the Employee thirty (30) days’ written notice of termination of this Agreement. If the Employee does not return to the performance of the Employee’s duties hereunder on a full-time basis by the end of the thirty day notice period, then the Bank may terminate the Employee’s employment hereunder effective on the thirty-first (31st) day following the giving by the Bank of such written notice of termination. Although employment under the terms of this Agreement will end, the termination of this Agreement will not affect the Employee’s employment and benefits under the Bank’s medical leave and/or disability plans, if applicable;   
  
(c)

Termination by the Bank for Cause. The Bank may terminate the Employee’s employment at any time for Cause, such termination to be effective as of the date stated in a written notice of termination delivered to the Employee. Before   
  
Form of Employment Agreement 4

If the Employee fails or is unable to cure, the Employee’s employment will terminate immediately;   
  
(d) Resignation by the Employee Other Than for Good Reason. The Employee may voluntarily resign his position with the Bank at any time for any reason or for no reason, other than under circumstances constituting Good Reason, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Bank.

(e) Termination by the Bank Other Than for Cause. The Bank may terminate Employee’s employment for any reason or for no reason upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to Employee. Such termination will be effective as of the date stated in a written notice of termination; or   
  
(f) Termination by Employee With Good Reason. The Employee may terminate the Employee’s employment hereunder at any time for Good Reason. The Employee must give the Bank written notice explaining the reasoning for the Employee’s determination that an event giving rise to Good Reason for termination has occurred and allow the Bank thirty (30) days to cure. If the Bank fails to cure, the Employee’s employment under this Agreement will end on the date stated in the notice by the Employee (or such earlier date after the delivery of such notice as the Bank may elect).   
  
In no event will the termination of the Employee’s employment affect the rights and obligations of the parties set forth in this Agreement, except as expressly set forth herein. Any termination of the Employee’s employment pursuant to this Section 6 will be deemed to be a termination of all of the Employee’s positions with the Bank.

(b) Minimum Bonus – Employment Continues. In the event of the occurrence of (i) a Change in Control under Section 8(a) and (ii) the continued employment of the Employee with the Bank, the Employee may be entitled to receive the minimum incentive compensation pursuant to this Section 8(b). During the term of this Agreement, if the Employee is otherwise eligible to receive an annual incentive award pursuant to the Bank’s Incentive Compensation Plan or Management Incentive Compensation Plan, as applicable, or a similar or successor plan following a Change in Control, then as an incentive to remain in the employ of the Bank the Employee shall be entitled to receive an incentive award that is at least equal to the amount calculated by multiplying 0.50 times the single highest incentive bonus payment paid to the Employee during the three-year period immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurred. The benefits under this Section 8(b) shall apply to each annual incentive period that occurs during the Term of the Agreement.   
  
Any conditions that are otherwise applicable to the Employee’s eligibility for an annual incentive award under the then-current incentive bonus plan, such as receiving a performance rating of “Meets Expectations” or higher and/or employment on the date of payment or similar conditions, shall be applicable to the Employee’s receipt of the minimum guaranteed amount hereunder. 

(c) Change in Control – Employment Terminates.

Any Change in Control Bonus payable hereunder shall be payable by the Bank on the same day that the annual incentive award is payable to the Employee, but no later than March 15th of the year following the year of termination. Any conditions that are otherwise applicable to the Employee’s eligibility for the   
  
Form of Employment Agreement 7

(d) Applicability of Both Sections 8(b) and 8(c) to the Employee. If Section 8(b) is applicable to the Employee in one year and then Section 8(c) becomes applicable, then the Change in Control Bonus Payment that the Employee would be entitled to receive shall be calculated by substituting the number of years remaining under the Agreement for the number in clause (iii) of the formula set forth in the preceding paragraph.
