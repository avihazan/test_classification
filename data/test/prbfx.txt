The Award is subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions set forth below and in the Plan. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

1\. Award Subject to Acceptance of Agreement. The Award shall be null and void unless the Holder shall accept this Agreement by executing it in the space provided below and returning such original execution copy to the Company.

2\. Rights as a Shareholder. 

(a) The Holder shall not be entitled to any privileges of ownership with respect to the Shares subject to the Award unless and until, and only to the extent, such shares are earned pursuant to Exhibit A attached hereto and become vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof and the Holder becomes a shareholder of record with respect to such shares.

(b) As of each date on which the Company pays a cash dividend to record owners of Shares (a “Dividend Date”), then the number of Shares subject to the Award shall increase by (i) the product of the total number of Shares subject to the Award immediately prior to such Dividend Date multiplied by the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per Share by the Company on such Dividend Date, divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share on such Dividend Date. Any such additional Shares shall be subject to the same vesting conditions and payment terms set forth herein as the shares to which they relate.

3\. Vesting. 

(a) Performance-Based Vesting Conditions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, the Holder shall be eligible to receive the number of Shares determined pursuant to Exhibit A only if the Holder is employed on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and remains continuously employed by the Company from such second anniversary through the date on which the Shares subject to the Award are distributed pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, the number of Shares to which the Holder is entitled shall be distributed no later than the March 15th occurring immediately after the last day of the year in which the applicable Performance Period ends (as defined in Exhibit A); provided, however, any Shares payable upon the satisfaction of any or all of the Performance Measures set forth on Exhibit A on or prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date, shall be distributed to the Holder no earlier than the second anniversary of the Grant Date and no later than the March 15th of the year following the second anniversary of the Grant Date. 

(b) Termination by Reason of Death or Disability.

regardless of whether such Performance Measures were satisfied before or after the Holder’s termination by reason of death or Disability . In such case, the Holder shall be entitled to the number of Shares that vest based on actual performance during each applicable Performance Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the number of days such Holder was employed during the applicable Performance Period and the denominator of which shall equal the total number of days in the applicable Performance Period. The number of Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 3(b) shall be distributed to the Holder (or the Holder’s beneficiary, if applicable) in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement and no later than the March 15th occurring immediately after the year in which the applicable Performance Period ends; provided, however, that undistributed Shares that vested prior to the Holder’s death or termination by reason of Disability shall be distributed no later than the March 15th immediately following the calendar year in which the Holder dies or terminates due to Disability, if earlier. 

(c) Termination by Reason of Involuntary Termination of Employment by the Company without Cause. In the event the employment of the Holder is terminated by reason of involuntary termination of employment by the Company without Cause (as defined below) on or prior to the two-year anniversary of the Grant Date, then the Holder shall be entitled to the number of Shares calculated based on actual performance through the date of termination. The number of Shares that vest pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be distributed in accordance with Section 4 no later than the March 15th occurring immediately after the year in which the Holder’s employment terminates due to an involuntary termination of employment by the Company without Cause.

The number of Shares that vest pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be distributed to the Holder in accordance with Section 4 and no later than the March 15th occurring immediately after the year in which the applicable Performance Period ends. The Holder shall forfeit the Shares subject to the Award to the extent such Shares do not vest in accordance with this Section 3(c) or Section 3(e) and were not previously distributed to the Holder in accordance with this Agreement. 

(d) Termination for any Other Reason. In the event the employment of the Holder is terminated for any reason other than the Holder’s death or Disability or the Company’s involuntary termination of the Holder’s employment without Cause prior to the date on which the Award is distributed pursuant to Section 4, then the Award shall be immediately forfeited by the Holder upon such termination of employment; provided, however, that the Committee may exercise its discretion to vest a portion of or the entire Award upon the Holder’s retirement (as determined by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion). 

(e) Change in Control.
