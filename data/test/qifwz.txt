6\. Termination.

(a) At-Will. This is an at-will employment agreement and does not bind either of the parties to any specific term or duration.

(ii) Company is free to terminate the employment of Employee at any time, for any reason or for no reason, for cause or without cause, and without any prior notice.

(b) Termination “Without Cause” — Separation Benefits. 

(i) Upon “involuntary termination” of his employment with Company for other than a “change of control”, as defined in Paragraph 6(c)(iii) below, Employee will be entitled to severance pay as provided in Paragraph 6(b)(ii) below, unless he is terminated for “cause” as defined in Paragraph 6(d)(ii) below. Employee’s entitlement to any severance pay is dependent on his execution of a complete release of claims against Company and its affiliates. 

(ii) In the event that severance pay is due to Employee as a result of the “involuntary termination” of his employment “without cause”, Employee will be paid six months’ “base salary” at the rate in effect immediately prior to the termination in six equal monthly installments (subject to all applicable taxes and other deductions), with the first such installment due 15 days after the date of such termination and with the following five installments due no later than monthly thereafter on Company’s then regular payroll dates. The Company will also pay the employer contribution and administrative cost of the health insurance premiums for the medical and dental insurance coverage previously maintained by the Company for Employee and his eligible dependents during this six month period or until Employee is provided or obtains medical and dental insurance coverage by another employer or entity, whichever first occurs.

(c) Change of Control — Separation Benefits. 

(i) Upon “involuntary termination” of his employment due to a “change of control” of Company, Employee will be entitled to severance pay as provided in Paragraph 6(c)(iv) below, unless he is terminated for “cause”, as defined in Paragraph 6(d)(ii) below.

(iii) The parties agree that for the purposes of this Employment Agreement, an “involuntary termination” due to a “change of control” will be deemed to have occurred when Employee is no longer employed by the Company’s successor following a “change of control” because the Employee’s position is eliminated within nine (9) months of the “change of control” or when Employee’s job responsibilities are materially and negatively changed within nine (9) months of the “change of control”, and Employee elects to resign.

(iv) In the event that severance pay is due to Employee as a result of the “involuntary termination” of his employment without “cause” due to a “change of control”, Employee will be paid one (1) year’s “base salary” at the rate in effect immediately prior to termination in twelve equal monthly installments (subject to all applicable taxes and other deductions), with the first such installment due 15 days after the date of such termination and with the following eleven installments due no later than monthly thereafter on Company’s then regular payroll dates. The Company will also pay the employer contribution and administrative cost of the health insurance premiums for the medical and dental insurance coverage previously maintained by the Company for Employee and his eligible dependents during this one year period or until Employee is provided or obtains medical and dental insurance coverage by another employer or entity, whichever first occurs.

(d) Termination “For Cause”; Voluntary Resignation.

(i) If Company or its successor terminates Employee for “cause” or if Employee’s employment terminates for any reason other than a termination by the Company “without cause” (as set forth in paragraph 6(b) or due to a “change of control” (as set forth in Paragraph 6(c)), Employee will not be entitled to any severance pay and shall only receive pay and benefits which Employee earned as of the date of termination.
