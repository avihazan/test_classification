This grant is an award of performance shares in the number of shares set forth on the cover sheet, subject to the vesting conditions described below (the “Performance Shares”). Your Performance Shares may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor may the Performance Shares be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  
  
Vesting

The Performance Shares shall vest as follows: (i) ___percent (___%) of the total number of Performance Shares granted hereunder shall vest for each ___ percent (___%) increase in free cash flow per share (“FCFPS”) (as defined in the Company’s most recent annual report and on a trailing twelve month basis, calculated quarterly) over FCFPS in the trailing twelve month period ended September 30, 200___of $___share (you will be ___(___%) vested in the Performance Shares if there has been a ___percent increase in FCFPS over FCFPS in the trailing twelve month period ended September 30, 200_) (ii) ___percent (___%) of the total number of Performance Shares granted hereunder shall vest for each ___% increase of the total royalty ounces in reserve (as determined below) on a per share of Stock basis for any annual reporting period over total royalty ounces in reserve on a per share of Stock basis of  ounces per share at the Grant Date. The vesting thresholds set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above are separate and independent thresholds that will each result in vesting; both thresholds need not be met for vesting to occur. For purposes of the forgoing vesting rules, total royalty ounces in reserve shall equal the sum of the royalty ounces in reserve for each royalty owned by the Company, each calculated by multiplying (C) times (D) where (C) equals the total ounces of gold (attributable to the Royal Gold royalty) in reserve as reported by the operator (if a royalty is for a metal other than gold, for purposes of this calculation, the total reserve of such metal shall be adjusted to a proportionate number of ounces of gold, based on the price of such metal to the price of gold at

Notwithstanding the foregoing vesting rules, if you incur an Involuntary Termination in connection with a Corporate Transaction, you shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested in the Performance Shares as of the date of such Involuntary Termination.  
  
For this purpose, Involuntary Termination in connection with a Corporate Transaction means a termination of your Service during the one year period commencing with a Corporate Transaction by reason of:  
  
(a) your involuntary discharge by the Company for reasons other than Cause; or  
  
(b) your voluntary resignation from the Company following (i) a material adverse change in your title or responsibilities with the Company, (ii) a material reduction in your base salary, or (iii) receipt of notice that your principal workplace will be relocated by more than 50 miles.  
  
The Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to certify whether the vesting thresholds set forth above have been achieved within the meaning of Treasury Regulations, Section 1.162-27(e)(5). Further, the Committee shall determine if you have incurred an Involuntary Termination and whether or not such Involuntary Termination was in connection with a Corporate Transaction. Any such determinations shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.  
  
The resulting aggregate number of vested Performance Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Performance Shares. You may not vest in more than the number of Performance Shares covered by this grant.
