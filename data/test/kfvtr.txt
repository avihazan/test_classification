WHEREAS, Employer desires to employ Executive to be primarily responsible for carrying out the strategic plans and policies established by the Employer’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on a day-to-day basis in connection with the procurement, management, and fulfillment of government initiated contracts within and without the United Arab Emirates; and   
WHEREAS, Executive desires to be employed by Employer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

1\. AGREEMENT TERM. 

The term of this Agreement shall be three (3) years beginning on August 5, 2008, and ending on August 4, 2011 (the “Term”), unless terminated sooner pursuant to the termination provisions herein contained.  
2\. POSITION AND DUTIES OF EMPLOYMENT.

a. Employment Duties and Title. Employer hereby employs Executive as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer, pursuant to the terms hereof, and Executive hereby accepts such employment. Executive’s duties and responsibilities generally shall be those customarily undertaken by the President of companies engaged in enterprises in which Employer is engaged, including but not necessarily limited to, general management and operations, responsibility for finance, administration, and human resources, and may include serving as a member of the Board. The Board may add, delete or otherwise alter Executive’s duties and responsibilities, provided the Board shall make all assignments of duties and responsibilities in good faith and shall not materially alter the general character of the work to be performed by Executive, who shall perform such duties and discharge such responsibilities as directed by the Board in a good and businesslike manner. Executive’s duties shall be governed to the same extent as other employees by such policies and procedures adopted by Employer from time to time that provide for the orderly administration of the workplace.

b. Performance. During the Term, Executive shall (i) devote his primary business time to the business of Employer; (ii) faithfully serve Employer; (iii) in all respects conform to and comply with the lawful and reasonable directions and instructions given to him by the Board in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and (iv) use his reasonable business efforts to promote and serve the interests of Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided the following does not interfere with Executive’s ability to perform his duties under this Agreement and does not create a conflict of interest, Executive may (i) participate in outside activities for remuneration; (ii) participate in the activities of professional trade organizations related to the business of Employer or its affiliates; (iii) engage in personal investing activities; and (iv) devote reasonable amounts of time to civic, social, community, charitable or religious pursuits.

3\. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.

a. Base Salary. Employer shall pay Executive an initial monthly base salary of Fifteen Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($15,000.00) for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the beginning of the Term, which shall be payable monthly as it accrues, or at such other intervals as Employer and Executive may hereafter from time to time agree in writing, thereafter Employer shall pay Executive a monthly base salary of Twenty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($20,000.00), which shall be payable monthly as it accrues, or at such other intervals as Employer and Executive may hereafter from time to time agree in writing, over the remainder of the Term. The parties recognize that this base salary is less than salaries paid to executives in similar positions, and that Executive has agreed to this salary in recognition of the Company’s cash flow constraints. Employer agrees that as soon as Company experiences net pretax profits for three (3) successive quarters, that Employer shall review Executive’s base salary and consider an increase in the amount payable commensurate with amounts paid to executives employed by other companies engaged in enterprises in which Employer is engaged.

b. Annual Bonus. On each anniversary of the beginning of the Term, Employer, at its sole discretion, shall pay Executive an annual bonus in an amount to be determined by the Board.

c. Stock Options. Executive shall be granted options to purchase One Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of the Company’s common stock, which shall vest as indicated on the schedule set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. All stock options described herein shall be granted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company’s 2008 Stock Option Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other document or agreement between the Company and Executive, each stock option granted to Executive shall have an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. 

d. Cost of Living and Merit Raises. Employer’s Board of Directors shall review Executive’s performance annually and may provide Executive with such cost of living and merit increases in salary, as the Board shall determine in its sole discretion.

e. Benefits. Employer shall provide Executive with at least such health, life, and disability benefits, retirement plans, and other benefits as are commensurate to those employed in the United Arab Emirates, and Executive may receive such additional benefits as may be approved by the Board in its discretion, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed as a covenant by Employer to establish, provide or maintain any such benefit programs.

f. Expenses. Employer shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable travel, entertainment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Executive in the course and scope of authorized Employer business regardless of when incurred. 

g. Vacation. Employer shall provide Executive with six (6) weeks paid vacation during each twelve-month period during the Term commencing with the second twelve-month period, which begins August 5, 2009.

h. Deductions from Payments. Employer may deduct or withhold from payments to be made to Executive pursuant to this Agreement all sums which may be required to be deducted or withheld under any applicable law now in effect or which may become effective during the Term of this Agreement, including but not limited, to Social Security contributions and income tax withholding.
