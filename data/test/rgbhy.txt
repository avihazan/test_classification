Executive further agrees, during the Non-Competition Period, to (i) refrain from directly or indirectly soliciting Company’s vendors, customers or employees, except that the Executive may solicit the Company’s vendors or customers in connection with a business that does not compete with the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) refrain from initiating, promoting or consulting with any third party with respect to any effort by any third party to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of the voting securities of the Company, or all or a material portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, assisting, encouraging or otherwise participating in any proxy contest with respect to matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. 

(b) The Executive hereby agrees that damages and any other remedy available at law would be inadequate to redress or remedy any loss or damage suffered by the Company upon any breach of the terms of this Section 9 by the Executive, and the Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to recovering on any claim for damages or obtaining any other remedy available at law, also may enforce the terms of this section 9 by injunction or specific performance, and may obtain any other appropriate remedy available in equity. 

10\. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT. During the Non-Competition Period, the Executive shall give notice to the Company of each new business activity he plans to undertake which business is the same as or similar to the business of the Company, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Executive finalizes his intention to engage in such activity. The Executive shall provide the Company with such other pertinent information concerning such business activity as the Company may reasonably request in order to determine the Executive’s continued compliance with his obligations under Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof. 

11\. ENFORCEMENT OF COVENANTS. The Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof. The Executive agrees that said restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its Affiliates and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area. The Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach any of the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8 or 9 hereof, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The 

\- 7 - 

* * *

Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of Section 7, 8 or 9 hereof shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

12\. CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS. Each of the Executive and the Company hereby represents and warrants that the execution of this Agreement and the performance of his or its obligations hereunder will not breach or be in conflict with any other agreement to which the Executive or the Company is a party or is bound. The Executive represents and warrants that he is not now subject to any covenants against competition or similar covenants or any court order or other legal obligation that would affect the performance of his obligations hereunder.
