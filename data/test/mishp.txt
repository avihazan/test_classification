WHEREAS, by action taken by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) it has adopted the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”); and

  


WHEREAS, pursuant to the Plan, it has been determined that in order to enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain qualified employees, consultants and directors, the Company has granted the Optionee the right to purchase the common stock of the Company pursuant to stock options.

  


NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises hereafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


1\. Grant of Non-Qualified Options. The Company irrevocably granted to the Optionee, as a matter of separate agreement and not in lieu of salary or other compensation for services, the right and option to purchase all or any part of 250,000 shares of authorized but unissued or treasury common stock of the Company (the “Options”) on the terms and conditions herein set forth. This Agreement replaces any stock option agreement previously provided to the Optionee, if any, with respect to these Options. The Optionee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan, as amended.

  


2\. Price. The exercise price of the Options is $1.25 per share.

  


3\. Vesting - When Exercisable.

  


(a) The Options shall vest in three equal annual increments, with the first vesting date being March 10, 2012, subject to meeting certain performance milestones set by the Compensation Committee and further subject to the Optionee’s continued employment with the Company on each applicable vesting date. Any fractional vesting shall be rounded up to the extent necessary. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Options shall vest immediately on the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined under the Plan. Additionally, all Options shall vest immediately on the date the Company publicly announces, by press release, by disclosure in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise (the “Public Announcement”), its intention to sell substantially all of the Company’s assets or to enter into a merger or consolidation as described in clauses (i) and (ii) under the definition of Change of Control in the Plan. If the Optionee exercises the Options within 10 calendar days from the date of the Public Announcement, the Optionee shall be deemed a record holder of the shares underlying the Options as of the record date of the Change of Control.

Further, in such event, the Company may at its option redeem shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of this Option by payment of the exercise price to the Optionee. The Company’s rights under this Section 5 do not lapse one year from the Termination Date but are a contract right subject to any appropriate statutory limitation period.

  


6\. Method of Exercise. The Options shall be exercisable by a written notice which shall:

  


(a) state the election to exercise the Options, the number of shares to be exercised, the person in whose name the stock certificate or certificates for such shares of common stock is to be registered, address and social security number of such person (or if more than one, the names, addresses and social security numbers of such persons);

(e) be accompanied by payment of any amount that the Company, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to comply with any federal, state or local withholding requirements for income and employment tax purposes. If the Optionee fails to make such payment in a timely manner, the Company may: (i) decline to permit exercise of the Options or (ii) withhold and set-off against compensation and any other amounts payable to the Optionee the amount of such required payment. Such withholding may be in the shares underlying the Options at the sole discretion of the Company.

7\. Sale of Shares Acquired Upon Exercise of Options. If the Optionee is an officer (as defined by Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Section 16(b)”)) or a director of the Company, any shares of the Company’s common stock acquired pursuant to the Options granted hereunder as set forth herein cannot be sold by the Optionee until at least six months elapse from the Grant Date except in case of death or disability or if the grant was exempt from the short-swing profit provisions of Section 16(b).

9\. Necessity to Become Holder of Record.

10\. Reservation of Right to Terminate Relationship. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict the right of the Company to terminate the relationship of the Optionee at any time, with or without cause. The termination of the relationship of the Optionee by the Company, regardless of the reason therefor, shall have the results provided for in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement.

  


11\. Conditions to Exercise of Options. If a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any other successor form) is not effective as to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Options, the remainder of this Section 11 is applicable as to federal law. In order to enable the Company to comply with the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and relevant state law, the Company may require the Optionee, the Optionee’s estate, or any Transferee as a condition of the exercising of the Options granted hereunder, to give written assurance satisfactory to the Company that the shares subject to the Options are being acquired for such person’s own account, for investment only, with no view to the distribution of same, and that any subsequent resale of any such shares either shall be made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable state law which has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being sold, or shall be pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state law.

The Options are further subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Board shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, or qualification of the shares of common stock underlying the Options upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with the issue or purchase of shares underlying the Options, the Options may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected.

  


12\. Transfer. No transfer of the Options by the Optionee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Company shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of the letters testamentary or such other evidence as the Board may deem necessary to establish the authority of the estate and the acceptance by the Transferee or Transferees of the terms and conditions of the Options.

  


13\. Duties of the Company. The Company will at all times during the term of Options:

(c) Use its best efforts to comply with all laws and regulations which, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, shall be applicable thereto.

  


14\. Parties Bound by Plan. The Plan and each determination, interpretation or other action made or taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final and shall be binding and conclusive for all purposes on the Company and the Optionee and the Optionee’s respective successors in interest.

  


15\. Severability. In the event any parts of this Agreement are found to be void, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless be binding with the same effect as though the void parts were deleted.

  


16\. Arbitration. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or its interpretation, application, implementation, breach or enforcement which the parties are unable to resolve by mutual agreement, shall be settled by submission by either party of the controversy, claim or dispute to binding arbitration in Palm Beach County, Florida (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.
