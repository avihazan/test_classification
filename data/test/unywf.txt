CALCULATION OF EXECUTIVE’S BONUS  
  
  


(i)

Year 1 Bonus: Executive will earn a 10% bonus of the increase in profits earned by the Company’s Professional Staffing Division for fiscal year ending September 30, 2012 over the profits of fiscal year ending September 30, 2011 (Base Year), minus any agreed upon corporate allocation.

* * *

  


(ii)

Year 2 Bonus: Executive will earn a 10% bonus of the increase in profits earned by the Company’s Professional Staffing Division for fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 over the profits of fiscal year ending September 30, 2012(Base Year), minus any agreed upon corporate allocation. In the event that the profitability for the Professional Staffing Division for fiscal year ending September 30, 2012 is below it’s profitability for fiscal year ending September 30, 2011; then the September 30, 2011 base year will be used for determining this Year 2 Bonus.  
  
  


(iii)

Year 3 Bonus: Executive will earn a 10% bonus of the increase in profits earned by the Company’s Professional Staffing Division for fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 over the profits of fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 (Base Year) , minus any agreed upon corporate allocation. In the event that the profitability for the Professional Staffing Division for fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 is below it’s profitability for fiscal year ending September 30, 2011; then the September 30, 2011 base year will be used for determining this Year 3 Bonus.  
  
  


As stated herein above, a Company acquisition which provides staffing services substantially in the IT, Accounting, Engineering, and Clerical Area on a contract and direct hire basis, will be considered in the profitability calculations once the applicable earnout period has expired. Subsequent to the earnout period, the profits of the first eligible fiscal year of the acquisition will be added to both the base year and to the bonus year’s profitability for calculation of Executive’s Bonus. Thereafter, the profits of the acquired company will only be added to the bonus year’s profitability for calculation of Executive’s bonus.

  


(c)

The Company shall reimburse Executive for all normal, reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incident to the performance of his Employment Duties in accordance with policies adopted by the Company from time to time, upon submission by Executive of an itemized account of such expenses containing such detail and accompanied by such supporting documentation as may be generally required by the Company.  
  
  


4.

Benefits and Vacation. Vacation time and all other benefits entitled to the Executive will be governed by the Company’s Employee Handbook. Notwithstanding any to the contrary in the Company’s Employee Handbook regarding the years of service required to earn vacation time, Executive shall receive 4 weeks of paid time off as vacation yearly.  
  
5.

Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive will have access to and receive certain proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets of Company, including, without limitation, customer lists, the terms of any oral or written agreement or understanding between Company and any customer, sales and business records, price lists and methods, financial and cost information, marketing plans, methods of doing business, methods and processes and business strategy documentation, as well as such other information as Company may designate as confidential from time to time (collectively "Confidential Information"). Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is the exclusive property of Company, not generally known to the trade or industry and, but for Company's engagement of Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Executive would not have had any access to the Confidential Information. Therefore, Executive agrees that he shall not disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his own purposes any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company.

* * *

  


(a)

During the Term and for the "Restricted Period" (hereinafter defined) following the effective date of the termination or expiration of the Term, for any or no reason whatsoever, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for his own benefit or for the benefit of any person or entity, other than Company pursuant to this Agreement, use, divulge, disseminate, disclose or communicate to any person or entity any of the Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever, unless Company otherwise consents to such use or disclosure of any item of the Confidential Information in writing prior to the use or disclosure thereof, in each instance and then only with respect to those items of Confidential Information specifically described, and only to the extent specifically authorized, in such written consent.  
  
  


(b)

With respect to each item of Confidential Information, the "Restricted Period" shall mean: (i) five (5) years, if such item of Confidential Information does not constitute or ceases to be a trade secret; or (ii) indefinitely, if such item of Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret; provided, however, if an item of Confidential Information ceases to be a trade secret, such item of Confidential Information shall remain confidential and proprietary to Company for a period of not less than five (5) years.  
  
  


(c)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information: (i) in the public domain; or (ii) that later becomes public, unless such information is made public by: (x) Executive as a result of the breach o this Agreement; or (y) any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, under an obligation of confidentiality to Company.  
  
  


(d)

Executive acknowledges and agrees that, under all circumstances, the restrictions upon him and his covenants, duties and obligations unto the Company set forth in this Paragraph 5 are necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, are given as a material inducement to the Company's employment of Executive, are reasonable in scope and duration and will not prevent Executive from pursuing other business ventures and employment opportunities or otherwise cause Executive a financial hardship.  
  
  


(e)

In the event that Executive reasonably believes, after consultation with counsel, that he is required by law to disclose any Confidential Information, Executive will: (i) provide the Company with prompt notice before such disclosure in order that the Company may attempt to obtain a protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information, and (ii) cooperate with the Company in attempting to obtain such order or assurance.  
  
  


(f)

All Confidential Information, files, records, documents and similar items relating to the business of the Company, and any copies, reproductions or recordings thereof in the Executive's possession or control, whether prepared by Executive or otherwise, shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Company and Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination or expiration of the Term, or at any other time that the Company may request: (i) all Confidential Information including all copies and reproductions thereof, and all writings and recordings incorporating or referring 'to the Confidential Information (ii) all other property of Company and (iii) certify in writing to Company that Executive has satisfied all of his covenants, duties and obligations pursuant to this Paragraph 5(g).

6.

Enforcement. If the duration of Executive's covenants, duties and obligations set forth in Paragraph 5 is held to be excessive, unreasonable, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such duration will be modified so as to be reasonable, valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction. Because Executive's services are unique and because Executive has access to Confidential Information, the parties hereto agree that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor (including, without limitation Company's right to reduce or eliminate further payment of the Earn Out Consideration as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement), shall be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof, without the requirement of posting a bond or security thereof. Executive hereby waives any claim or defense that Company has an adequate remedy at law or is not being irreparably injured and will not raise or suggest any such claim or defense in any action or proceeding initiated by or on behalf of Company. Company's rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative in nature, and no such right or remedy shall be, or be considered to be, Company's sole and exclusive right or remedy.  
  
7.

Executive's Representations. Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Executive does not and shall not conflict with, breach, violate or cause a default under any contract, agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which Executive is a party or by which he is bound, (ii) other than as contained in that certain Non-Disclosure and Non-Competition Agreement of even date herewith by and among Company, Ashley Ellis and Executive, Executive is not a party to or bound by any employment agreement, non-compete agreement or confidentiality agreement with any other person or entity and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, this Agreement shall be the valid and binding obligation of Executive, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

8.

Compliance with IRC Code Section 409. This Agreement is intended to comply with IRC Code Section 409A and the interpretative guidance thereunder, including the exceptions for short-term deferrals, separation pay arrangements, reimbursements, and in-kind distributions, and shall be administered accordingly. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted with such intent. If a payment under this Agreement does not qualify as a short-term deferral under IRC Code Section 409A and Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any similar or successor provisions), and the Executive is a Specified Employee (as defined below) as of his termination, distributions to the Executive may not be made before the date that is six months after the date of his termination or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death (the "Six-Month Delay Rule"). Payments to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the termination (the "Six-Month Delay") will be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the termination. Notwithstanding the Six-Month Delay Rule set forth in this Section:

* * *

To the maximum extent permitted under IRC Code Section 409A and Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (or any similar or successor provisions), during each month of the Six-Month Delay, the Company will pay the Executive an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the total monthly severance provided under this Agreement, or (ii) one-sixth (1/6) of the lesser of (1) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to IRC Code Section 401(a)(17) for the year in which the Executive termination occurs, and (2) the sum of the Executive’s annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Company for the taxable year of the Executive’s preceding the taxable year of the Executive in which his termination occurs (adjusted for any increase during that year that was expected to continue indefinitely if the Executive had not had a termination); provided that amounts paid under this sentence will count toward, and will not be in addition to, the total payment amount required to be made to the Executive by the Company under this Agreement; and

To the maximum extent permitted under IRC Code Section 409A and Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(D) (or any similar or successor provisions), within ten (10) days of the termination, the Company will pay the Executive an amount equal to the applicable dollar amount under IRC Code Section 402(g)(1)(B) for the year of the Executive’s termination; provided that the amount paid under this sentence will count toward, and will not be in addition to, the total payment amount required to be made to the Executive by the Company under this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Specified Employee" has the meaning given that term in IRC Code Section 409A and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(c)(i) (or any similar or successor provisions). The Company's "specified employee identification date" (as described in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(c)(i)(3)) will be December 31 of each year, and the Company's 'specified employee effective date' (as described in Treas. Reg. 1.409A- 1(c)(i)(4) or any similar or successor provisions) will be February 1 of each succeeding year."

Each payment under this Agreement or any Company benefit plan is intended to be treated as one of a series of separate payments for purposes of IRC Code Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) (or any similar or successor provisions).

  


9.

Survival. Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,14 and15 shall survive and continue in full force in accordance with its terms, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the Term for any or no 'reason whatsoever.  
  
10.
