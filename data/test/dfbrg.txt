W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Company wishes to employ the Executive, and the Executive wishes to enter employment with the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:

1\.  Employment. During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall employ the Executive as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's Footwear, Accessories & Retail Group (the "FAR Group"), which presently is comprised of the United States and international wholesale and retail operations of its Nine West Group Inc. ("NWG") subsidiary, and as the President and Chief Executive Officer of NWG, with overall responsibility for and authority over all of the operations of the FAR Group. During Executive's employment, the Company shall also elect Executive to the board of directors of each of NWG and NWG's subsidiaries. The Executive shall report directly to the Executive Management Committee of the Company. During the Term of this Agreement, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote all of Executive's business time and attention to the business affairs of the Company, and to perform such responsibilities in a professional manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Term of this Agreement, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (a) serve on civic or charitable boards or committees; (b) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions; (c) serve as a non-employee member of a board of directors of a business entity which is not competitive with the Company and as to which the Board of Directors of the Company has given its consent; and (d) attend to personal business, so long as such activities do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as a senior executive of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

2\. Term. The Executive shall be employed for the period (the "Initial Term") commencing October 22, 2001 and ending on December 31, 2004 (the "Expiration Date"), as renewed in accordance with the following sentence (the "Term"). The Executive's employment will continue, and this Agreement will be automatically extended without limitation, for successive 12-month periods commencing January 1 and ending December 31 (a "Contract Year"), unless either party to this Agreement advises the other in writing, no later than December 

1

* * *

31, 2002 and each December 31 thereafter, that such party does not wish to extend (a "Non-extension Notice"). If this Agreement shall be so extended, the "Expiration Date" shall mean the then applicable extended "Expiration Date", and the "Term" shall mean the period commencing December 17, 2001 and ending on the then applicable extended "Expiration Date".

For example, (i) if by December 31, 2002, neither party has given a Non-extension Notice to the other, the Term will be automatically extended through December 31, 2005, and (ii) if the Term is so extended through December 31, 2005, then if by December 31 , 2003, neither party has given a Non-extension Notice to the other, the Term will be automatically extended through December 31, 2006.

(a) Throughout the Term, the Executive shall receive a salary at the annual rate of not less than $1,000,000.

(b) During the Term, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement plans, practices, policies and programs to the extent applicable generally to other senior executives of the Company.

(c) During the Term, the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare, fringe and other benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company (including, without limitation, medical, prescription drug, dental, disability, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs) to the extent applicable generally to other senior executives of the Company.

4\. Bonus. Executive shall participate in the Company's Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the "Bonus Plan"), pursuant to which the Executive will be entitled to receive an annual bonus payment for each full Contract Year of employment which ends prior to the Expiration Date and throughout which the Executive has been employed by the Company, conditioned upon the attainment of annual criteria and objectives established for participants in the Bonus Plan.

(iv) The Options shall vest ratably on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant; provided, however, that all Options (and all other options to purchase Common Shares

(6) a reduction in the Executive's title and status as President and Chief Executive Officer of the FAR Group, or as President and Chief Executive Officer of NWG, or any change in the Executive's status as reporting directly to the Executive Management Committee of the Company (other than a change pursuant to which the Executive is reporting to either the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or to the Company's Board of Directors); or the assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent with the Executive's positions (including, without limitation, status, office, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 1 of this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a material diminution in such positions, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose any action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company no later than thirty (30) days after written notice by the Executive; or

(f) The Executive shall have no obligation to seek other employment or otherwise mitigate the Company's obligations to make payments under this Section 6, and the Company's obligations shall not be reduced by the amount, if any, of other compensation or income earned or received by the Executive after the effective date of Executive's termination.

7\. Effect of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, and except as provided in Section 7(b), to the extent that any payment or distribution of any type to or for the benefit of the Executive by the Company (or by any affiliate of the Company, any person or entity who acquires ownership or effective control of the Company or ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder), or any affiliate of such person or entity, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Total Payments"), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in the Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax), than if the Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments. Unless the Executive shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the Determination (as defined herein). Any notice given by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive's rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation.

(b) The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in this Section 7 and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the Company from among its independent auditors and the five (5) largest accounting firms (an "Eligible Accounting Firm") in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) days of the last day of Executive's employment. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it 

8

* * *

shall furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Executive shall have the right to accept the Determination of the Accounting Firm as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to this Section 7, or to have such Determination reviewed by another Eligible Accounting Firm selected by the Executive, at the expense of the Company, in which case the determination of such second accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive.

8\. Company Property. Any trade name or mark, program, discovery, process, design, invention or improvement which the Executive makes or develops, which relates, directly or indirectly, to the business of the Company or its affiliates, or Executive's employment by the Company, shall be considered as "made for hire" and shall belong to the Company and shall be promptly disclosed to the Company. During the Executive's employment and thereafter, the Executive shall, without additional compensation, execute and deliver to or as requested by the Company, any instruments of transfer and take such other action as the Company may reasonably request to carry out the provisions hereof, including filing, at the Company's sole expense, trademark, patent or copyright applications for any trade name or mark, invention or writing covered hereby and assigning such applications to the Company.

9\. Confidential Information. The Executive shall not, either during the term of Executive's employment by the Company or thereafter, disclose to anyone or use (except, in each case, in the performance of Executive's responsibilities hereunder and in the regular course of the Company's business), any information acquired by the Executive in connection with or during the period of Executive's employment by the Company, with respect to any confidential, proprietary or secret aspect of the affairs of the Company or any of its affiliates, including but not limited to the requirements and terms of dealings with existing or potential licensors, licensees, designers, suppliers and customers and methods of doing business, all of which the Executive acknowledges are confidential and proprietary to the Company, and any of its affiliates, as the case may be.

10\. Competition; Recruitment; Non-Disparagement.

(a) The Executive shall not, at any time during Executive's employment by the Company and during the Severance Period (provided that the Company is making the payments to Executive which may be required hereby during such Severance Period) (the "Non-Compete Period") and under the following circumstances, engage or become interested (as an owner, stockholder, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant or otherwise) in any business which then competes, directly or indirectly, with the business then conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous sentence, if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause prior to the end of the Initial Term, the restrictions imposed on Executive by such sentence shall remain in effect only for so 

9

* * *

long as the Company pays the Executive during each remaining month of the Initial Term an amount equal to Executive's monthly salary at the rate in effect immediately preceding termination and provides to Executive, throughout the Initial Term, continuation of Executive's participation (including the Company's contributions thereto) in all benefit plans and practices in which Executive was participating immediately preceding termination. The ownership of less than 5% of the stock of a publicly owned company which competes with the Company, any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, in and of itself, shall not be considered a violation of the provisions of this Section 10.

(b) The Executive shall not, at any time during Executive's employment by the Company and thereafter until the second anniversary of the expiration of the Non-Compete Period, recruit, solicit for employment, hire or engage, or assist any person or entity in recruiting, soliciting for employment, hiring or engaging, any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or consultant to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates who has provided sales, marketing or merchandising consultation services to the FAR Group, or any person who was such an employee or such a consultant of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or affiliates within one year before the termination of the Executive's employment.

(c) For the longer of any period applicable under this Section 10 or a period of three years immediately following the date of termination, (i) the Company, and its respective affiliates and employees shall not disparage the Executive, and (ii) the Executive shall not disparage the Company, or its respective affiliates and employees.

(d) The Executive acknowledges that the provisions in Section 10(b) are necessary for the protection of the Company, and its subsidiaries and affiliates and are not unreasonable, because the Executive would be able to recruit and hire personnel other than employees of the Company, and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates. The Executive further agrees that a breach of Section 8, 9 or 10 of this Agreement shall result in the immediate cessation of any payments pursuant to this Section 10 and Section 6 hereof, if applicable. The duration and the scope of these restrictions on the Executive's activities are divisible, so that if any provision of this Section 10 is held or deemed to be invalid, that provision shall be automatically modified to the extent necessary to make it valid.

11\. Notices. Any notice or other communication to the Company or to the Executive under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered given on the third business day following mailing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such party at Executive's address on file with the Company, with a copy to Fredric J. Gruder, Esq., Dorsey & Whitney LLP, 250 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10177, or to the Company at 1411 Broadway, New York, New York 10018, Attention: General Counsel (or at such other address as such party may specify by written notice to the other party).

12\. Successors; Binding Agreement.

No rights or obligations of the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company, except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity, or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee assumes all of the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The Company will require any such successor to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.

14\. Interest on Late Payments. "Undisputed Late Obligations" shall bear interest beginning on the Due Date until paid in full at an annual rate of one percent (1.0%) plus the prime rate as declared from time to time by The Chase Manhattan Bank. For purposes hereof, "Undisputed Late Obligations" shall mean any obligation which remains unpaid 5 days after written notice thereof is delivered to the other party in accordance with Section 11 (the "Due Date") for money under this Agreement owing from one party to another, which obligation (i) is not subject to any bona fide dispute or (ii) has been adjudicated by an arbitration panel or court of competent jurisdiction to be due and payable.

15\. Arbitration. Except as otherwise provided herein, all controversies, claims or disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be settled under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (sitting in Manhattan) then in effect in the State of New York,

as the sole and exclusive remedy of either party, and judgment upon such award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

16\. Attorneys' Fees. The Company shall reimburse the Executive (or the Executive shall reimburse the Company) for all reasonable costs, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, of the Executive or the Company, as the case may be, in any dispute, arbitration or proceeding arising under this Agreement (collectively, a "Proceeding"), so long as the Executive or the Company, as the case may be, "prevails in substantial part" with respect to Executive's or the Company's claims or defenses in such Proceeding. For purposes hereof, the Executive shall be deemed to have "prevailed in substantial part" if (i) the Executive is the party originally demanding a Proceeding, and the arbitrator(s) shall have awarded the Executive at least 75% of the amount originally demanded by the Executive, or (ii) the Company is the party originally demanding a Proceeding, and the arbitrator(s) shall have denied the Company the relief originally requested. The Company shall be deemed to have "prevailed in substantial part" if the Executive is the party originally demanding a Proceeding and the arbitrator(s) shall have awarded the Executive less than 25% of the amount originally demanded by the Executive.

17\. Miscellaneous.

(a) Given that a breach of the provisions of this Agreement would injure the Company irreparably, the Company may, in addition to its other remedies, obtain an injunction or other comparable relief restraining any violation of this Agreement, and no bond, security or other undertaking shall be required of the Company in connection therewith.

(b) The provisions of this Agreement are separable, and if any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

(c) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties, and supersedes all other existing agreements between the parties, and cannot be amended, unless such amendment is in writing and signed by both parties to this Agreement.

The parties hereto consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the State of New York to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement or otherwise.

(e) The headings in this Agreement are solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect its interpretation.

(f) The failure of either party to insist on strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right 

12

* * *

thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement. For any waiver of a provision of this Agreement to be effective, it must be in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is claimed.

13
