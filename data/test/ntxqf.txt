2\. Grant of Option. The Company hereby grants to the Participant the right and option to purchase, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, 25,000 Shares of the Company (the “Option”), subject to adjustment as set forth in the Plan. The exercise price of the Shares subject to the Option shall be $21.02 per Share (the “Option Price”), subject to adjustment as set forth in the Plan. The Option is intended to be a nonqualified stock option and is not intended to be treated as an ISO that complies with Section 422 of the Code. The Option Price is no less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Date of the Grant. 

3\. Vesting of the Option. 

(a) In General. Subject to the Participant’s continued Employment with the Company and its Affiliates, the Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares subject to the Option on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Date of the Grant. 

(b) Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change in Control, the Option shall, to the extent not previously cancelled or expired, immediately become 100% vested and exercisable. 

(c) Termination of Employment. If the Participant’s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason, the Option, to the extent not then vested and exercisable, shall be immediately canceled by the Company without consideration; provided, however, that if the Participant’s Employment terminates due to the Participant’s death or Disability, to the extent not previously cancelled or expired, the Option shall immediately become vested and exercisable as to the Shares subject to the Option that would have otherwise vested and become exercisable in the calendar year in which such termination of Employment occurs. 

4\. Exercise of Option.

(a) Period of Exercise. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the Participant may exercise all or any part of the Vested Portion of the Option at any time prior to the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant’s Employment terminates prior to the Expiration Date, the Vested Portion of the Option shall remain exercisable for the period set forth below: 

(i) Termination due to Death or Disability, Termination by the Company without Cause or Termination by the Participant. If the Participant’s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated (a) due to the Participant’s death or Disability, (b) by the Company without Cause or (c) by the Participant, the Participant may exercise the Vested Portion of the Option for a period ending on the earlier of (A) one year following the date of such termination and (B) the Expiration Date; and 

(ii) Termination by the Company for Cause. If the Participant’s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated by the Company for Cause, the Vested Portion of the Option shall immediately terminate in full and cease to be exercisable.

(b) Method of Exercise. 

(i) Subject to Section 4(a) of this Agreement, the Vested Portion of an Option may be exercised by delivering to the Company at its principal office written notice of intent to so exercise; provided that the Option may be exercised with respect to whole Shares only. Such notice shall specify the number of Shares for which the Option is being exercised and, other than as described in clause (C) of the following sentence, shall be accompanied by payment in full of the aggregate Option Price in respect of such Shares. Payment of the aggregate Option Price may be made (A) in cash, or its equivalent (e.g., a check), (B) by transferring to the Company Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee; provided that such Shares have been held by the Participant for at least the minimum period, if any, required by the Company’s accountants to avoid an adverse accounting impact on the Company under generally accepted accounting principles, (C) if there is a public market for the Shares at the time of payment, subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee, through delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Option Price or (D) such other method as approved by the Committee. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such Shares or otherwise completed the exercise transaction as described in the preceding sentence and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed pursuant to this Agreement. 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, absent an available exemption to registration or qualification, the Option may not be exercised prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Option or the Shares under applicable state and federal securities or other laws, or under any ruling or regulation of any governmental body or national securities exchange that the Committee shall in its sole reasonable discretion determine to be necessary or advisable. 

(iii) Upon the Company’s determination that the Option has been validly exercised as to any of the Shares, the Company shall issue certificates in the Participant’s name for such Shares. However, the Company shall not be liable to the Participant for damages relating to any delays in issuing the certificates to the Participant, any loss by the Participant of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the issuance of the certificates or in the certificates themselves. 

(iv) In the event of the Participant’s death, the Vested Portion of the Option shall remain vested and exercisable by the Participant’s executor or administrator, or the person or persons to whom the Participant’s rights under this Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth in Section 4(a) of this Agreement. Any heir or legatee of the Participant shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

5\. No Right to Continued Employment. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Participant the right to be retained in the employ of, or in any relationship to, the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or its Affiliate may at any time terminate the Participant or discontinue any relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. 

6\. Legend on Certificates. The certificates representing the Shares purchased by exercise of the Option shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem reasonably advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares are listed, any applicable federal or state laws and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 

7\. Transferability. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Option may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate; provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance. During the Participant’s lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by the Participant. 

8\. Withholding. The Participant may be required to pay to the Company or its Affiliate and the Company or its Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from any payment due or transfer made under the Option or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property) of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of the Option, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under the Option or under the Plan and to take such action as may be necessary in the option of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 

9\. Securities Laws. Upon the acquisition of any Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option, the Participant will make or enter into such written representations, warranties and agreements as the Committee may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securities laws or with this Agreement. 

10\. Notices. Any notice under this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of its General Counsel, addressed to the principal executive office of the Company and to the Participant at the address appearing in the personnel records of the Company for the Participant or to either party at such other address as either party hereto may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee. 

11\. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
