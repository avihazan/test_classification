4 

* * *

Section 4(b) (the “Term”). One-hundred and eighty (180) days before the end of the second year and one-hundred and eighty (180) days before the end of each year thereafter, the Agreement is extended for an additional one (1)-year period unless either party gives prior notice of termination.

(c) Severance (Expiration of Agreement). In the event that during the Term the Company elects by written notice not to extend the Term and Executive will not have attained age 65 at the expiration of the then current Term, Executive shall be entitled to: (1) 100% of Base Salary, plus 100% of Target Annual Bonus, payable monthly in equal installments over 12 months; (2) pro-rated bonus based on actual performance for the year of Termination, payable when other Company bonuses are paid for such year; and (3) continued participation for 12 months in health, dental, disability, and life insurance plans at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution as was in effect immediately prior to Termination. Additionally, all equity and long-term incentive awards not vested as of the effective end date of the Agreement, but due to vest in the first 364 days following the effective end date of the Agreement, will become 100% vested on the effective end date of the Agreement. The payment of severance shall be conditioned upon Executive’s signing (and not revoking within the revocation period, if any, provided pursuant to the applicable release agreement) of a general release in favor of the Company. Nothing contained herein shall limit or impinge any other rights or remedies of the Company or Executive under any other agreement or plan to which Executive is a party or of which Executive is a beneficiary. 

(d) Severance (No Change In Control). Upon termination of this Agreement by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason when no Change In Control has occurred, Executive shall be entitled to: (1) 100% of Base Salary, plus 100% of Target Annual Bonus, payable monthly in equal installments over 12 months; (2) pro-rated bonus based on actual performance for the year of Termination, payable when other Company bonuses are paid for such year; and (3) Continued participation for 12 months in health, dental, disability, and life insurance plans at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution as was in effect immediately prior to Termination. Additionally, if Executive is terminated other than for Cause or if Executive terminates for Good Reason, all equity and long-term incentive awards not vested as of the effective 

5 

* * *

termination date, but due to vest in the first 364 days following the effective termination date, will become 100% vested on the effective termination date. The payment of severance shall be conditioned upon Executive’s signing (and not revoking within the revocation period, if any, provided pursuant to the applicable release agreement) of a general release in favor of the Company. Nothing contained herein shall limit or impinge any other rights or remedies of the Company or Executive under any other agreement or plan to which Executive is a party or of which Executive is a beneficiary. 

(e) Severance (Change in Control). If within 2 years following a Change in Control (as defined herein), Executive is terminated without Cause or resigns for Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to: (1) 200% of Base Salary, plus 200% of Target Annual Bonus, payable in a single lump sum; (2) pro-rated bonus based on target bonus for the year of Termination, payable with lump sum severance benefit; and (3) continued participation for 24 months in health, dental, disability, and life insurance plans at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution as was in effect immediately prior to Termination. Additionally, all equity and long term incentive awards not vested will become 100% vested on the effective date of the Change in Control. The payment of severance shall be conditioned upon Executive’s signing (and not revoking within the revocation period, if any, provided pursuant to the applicable release agreement) of a general release in favor of the Company. Nothing contained herein shall limit or impinge any other rights or remedies of the Company or Executive under any other agreement or plan to which Executive is a party or of which Executive is a beneficiary. 

(f) With respect to any of the severance above, Executive shall not be required to mitigate such payments through other employment. 

(g) With respect to any of the severance above, Executive understands and agrees that the payment of severance is conditioned upon Executive’s compliance with the post-employment restrictive covenants in this Employment Agreement and that such severance payments will immediately cease if Executive violates such covenants. Further, as part of the general release that Executive must sign to receive any severance, Executive agrees that, if included as part of the release, he will re-confirm his commitment to the post-employment restrictive covenants in this Employment Agreement. 

(h) Retirement. Executive shall have the right to retire at age 65. Upon retirement, all equity and long-term incentive awards not vested as of the effective retirement date will continue to become vested, and in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, exercisable, according to their terms, but without regard to the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company on the retirement date. 

(i) Parachute Payment Limitation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any severance payments will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid Section 280G/4999 excise taxes if the net after-tax value of the payments that Executive would receive without the reduction is not more than 10% greater than the net after-tax value of the payments that Executive would receive following the reduction. 

6 

* * *

(j) Survival. The covenants of Executive in Sections 5, 6, and 7 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the end of Executive’s employment hereunder and shall not be extinguished thereby except as set forth below. 

5. Agreement Not to Compete.  
  
Executive agrees that commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing through the Applicable Period, he will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld in the Company’s sole discretion): 

(a) provide services of a leadership, management, executive, operational, or advisory capacity and/or participate in the ownership of or provide financial backing to an automotive dealership that is located within the Area; 

(b) provide senior/corporate level leadership, executive, operational, or advisory services to any corporate competitor of the Company who owns or operates one or more automotive dealerships within the Area; and 

(c) provide services of a leadership, management, executive, operational, or advisory capacity for anyone or any business whose focus is buying, conglomerating, or otherwise acquiring one or more automotive dealerships that are located within the Area. 

For purposes of this Section 5, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company conducts business in the Area and that the Area is a reasonable geographic limitation. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees that the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed breached as a result of the passive ownership by Executive of: (i) less than an aggregate of 5% of any class of stock of a business that competes with the Company; or (ii) less than an aggregate of 10% in value of any instrument of indebtedness of a business that competes with the Company. The Company further agrees that nothing in this Section 5 prohibits Executive from accepting employment from, and performing services for, businesses engaged in the finance industry, and businesses engaged in the manufacturing and/or sale of automobile parts or the provision of automotive service, provided such businesses do not also engage in the retail of automobiles within the Area. By way of example, nothing in this Section 5 would prohibit Executive from working with such businesses as American General Finance, NAPA Auto Parts, or Goodyear. 

Upon Executive’s termination of employment with the Company Executive agrees to re-confirm his commitment to the post-employment restrictive covenants in this Employment Agreement. Executive further agrees that as part of that re-confirmation, the term “Area” and Exhibit A hereto may be amended by the Company, but only to the extent necessary to list the addresses of the Company’s headquarters and any automotive dealerships that the Company owns and/or operates as of the Termination Date. 

7 

* * *

6. Agreement Not to Solicit/Hire Employees.  
  
Executive agrees that commencing on the Commencement Date, continuing through the Applicable Period, and for an additional one (1) year thereafter, he will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit or hire any employee of the Company (or any person who was an employee of the Company during the 12 month period preceding Executive’s date of termination) or encourage any such employee to terminate employment with the Company. 

7. Ownership and Protection of Proprietary Information.  
  
(a) Confidentiality. All Company Information received or developed by Executive while employed by the Company is confidential to and will remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Except to the extent necessary to perform the duties assigned to him by the Company, Executive will hold such Company Information in trust and strictest confidence, and will not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose or otherwise disseminate Company Information or any physical embodiments thereof and may in no event take any action causing or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any Company Information disclosed to or developed by Executive to lose its character or cease to qualify as Confidential Information or Trade Secrets. 

(b) Return of Company Property. Upon request by the Company, and in any event upon termination of the employment of Executive with the Company for any reason, Executive will promptly deliver to the Company all property belonging to the Company, including, without limitation and including electronic property of any type, all Company Information (and all embodiments thereof) then in Executive’s custody, control or possession. 

(c) Protection of Confidential Information. Executive agrees that: (i) he will protect all Company Information from disclosure and will in no event take any action causing any Company Information to lose its character as Company Information, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent any Company Information from losing its status as Company Information; and (ii) he will not, directly or indirectly, use, publish, disseminate or otherwise disclose any Company Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Company, which may be withheld in the Company’s absolute discretion. 

(d) Survival. The restrictions on Executive’s use or disclosure of all Company Information, as set forth in this section, shall apply through the Applicable Period and for an additional one (1) year thereafter and with respect to Trade Secrets shall survive beyond such period for so long as such information qualifies as a Trade Secret by the law of the applicable state. 

8. Construction/Enforcement of Post-Employment Covenants.  
  
Executive agrees that the provisions of Sections 5, 6, and 7 are reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the business and the goodwill of the Company. However, if a judicial determination is made that any of the provisions of 

8 

* * *

Sections 5, 6, or 7 constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable restriction against Executive, such provision(s) shall be modified or severed so as to permit enforcement of the provision(s) to the extent reasonable. 

9. Violation of Post-Employment Covenants.  
  
If Executive breaches any provision in Sections 5, 6, and 7, Executive understands and agrees that the Company may stop paying any additional severance pursuant to Section 4 until such time as any dispute over Executive’s alleged breaches of Sections 5, 6 and 7 have been resolved, either judicially or otherwise, and demand repayment of 50% of any such severance paid prior to the breach. Any forfeiture or repayment by Executive will not be in lieu of any other remedy provided for herein or injunctive relief ordering Executive to cease violating Executive’s obligations or any other equitable relief. To the extent that Executive is determined through agreement or resolution of any pending claim to not have violated any covenant at issue, he shall receive any and all severance that has not been paid under the Agreement. 

10. No Set-Off.  
  
The existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action by Executive against the Company, or any Affiliate of the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any of its rights hereunder. The existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action by the Company against Executive, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Executive of any of his rights hereunder. 

11. Notice.
