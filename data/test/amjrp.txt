* * *

  


(b) cause the Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

(c) so long as a Registration Statement is effective covering the resale of the applicable Registrable Securities owned by a Holder, furnish to such Holder such number of copies of the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, including a preliminary prospectus and any supplements to the prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as such Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of such Holder’s Registrable Securities;

(f) use all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and, if such an order is issued, to use all commercially reasonable efforts obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible time and to notify each Holder in writing of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof;

(g) notify each Holder in the event that, in the judgment of the Company, it is advisable to suspend use of a prospectus included in the Registration Statement due to pending material developments or other events as to which the Company believes it would be detrimental to the Company to maintain the Registration Statement at such time or is in the best interests of the Company to suspend sales under the Registration Statement at such time (provided that the Company shall not so suspend the use of a prospectus for a period in excess of 90 Trading Days in any 365-day period);

In connection with the registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement, each Holder shall:

(b) upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in paragraphs 3(e), 3(f) or 3(g), immediately discontinue any sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until the filing of an amendment or supplement as described in paragraph 3(e), withdrawal of the stop order referred to in paragraph 3(f) or, if use of a prospectus has been suspended pursuant to paragraph 3(g), until the Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the then current prospectus may be used and the Holder has received notice of the filing of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such prospectus, and in each case use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of such notice and its contents;

(c) to the extent required by applicable Law, deliver a prospectus to the purchaser of such Registrable Securities;

(d) upon request of the Company, notify the Company when it has sold all of the Registrable Securities held by it; and

4

* * *

  


(e) notify the Company in the event that any information supplied by such Holder in writing for inclusion in the Registration Statement or related prospectus is untrue or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such information not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; immediately discontinue any sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until the filing of an amendment or supplement to such prospectus as may be necessary so that such prospectus does not contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company as may be appropriate to make such amendment or supplement effective for such purpose.

5\. INDEMNIFICATION

In the event that any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of such Holder, and each person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (whether joint or several) (collectively, including reasonable legal expenses or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same, “Losses”), insofar as any such Losses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5(c) below, the Company will reimburse such Holder, and each such officer, director, employee, agent, representative or controlling person, for any reasonable legal expenses or other out-of-pocket expenses as reasonably incurred by any such entity or person in connection with investigating or defending any Loss; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Loss if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be obligated to indemnify any person for any Loss to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Loss arises out of or is based upon (i) any disclosure or any omission or alleged omission (to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make statements therein not misleading) that is based upon or in conformity with written information furnished (or not furnished, in the case of an omission) by such person expressly for use in the Registration Statement or (ii) a failure of such person to deliver or cause to be delivered the final prospectus contained in the Registration Statement and made available by the Company, if such delivery is required by applicable Law.

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Holder who is named in the Registration Statement as a selling stockholder, acting severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the officers, directors, employees, agents and 

5

* * *

  


representatives of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Losses to the extent (and only to the extent) that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon (i) any disclosure or any omission or alleged omission (to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make statements therein not misleading) that is based upon or in conformity with written information furnished (or not furnished, in the case of an omission) by such person expressly for use in the Registration Statement, or (ii) a failure of such Holder to deliver or cause to be delivered the final prospectus contained in the Registration Statement and made available by the Company, if such delivery is required under applicable Law. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5(c) below, such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by the Company and any such officer, director, employee, agent, representative, or controlling person, in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such Loss if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this paragraph 5(b) exceed the net proceeds resulting from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by such Holder under the Registration Statement.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 5, promptly deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of one such counsel for all indemnified parties to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the delivery of notice of any such action, to the extent materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5 with respect to such action, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 5 or with respect to any other action unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of not receiving such notice. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the indemnified party.

(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and each Holder agree, severally and not jointly, to contribute to the aggregate Losses to which the Company or such Holder may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to 

6

* * *

  


reflect the relative fault of the Company and such Holder in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall such Holder be responsible for any amount in excess of the net proceeds resulting from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by it under any Registration Statement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or by such Holder. The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 5, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

(e) Neither party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

6\. REPORTS. 

With a view to making available to each Holder the benefits of Rule 144 and any other similar rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit such Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

(b) file with the Commission all reports required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and

(c) furnish to such Holder, so long as such Holder owns any Registrable Securities, upon written request (i) a written statement by the Company, if true, that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and the Exchange Act, and (ii) to the extent not publicly available through the Commission’s EDGAR database, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company.

7\. ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS.

If the Company undergoes a transaction, including but not limited to a consolidation, merger, business combination or change of control, pursuant to which the Common Stock is exchanged for securities or a combination of securities and other property, the Company shall require, as a condition of such transaction, that the 

7

* * *

  


company issuing such securities assume all of the Company’s obligations under this Agreement such that such obligations become effective with respect to the securities received by all Holders in exchange for Common Stock unless (a) prior to the consummation of such transaction, all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to either the Registration Statement or Rule 144, or (b) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Holders, all of the Registrable Securities may be immediately resold to the public pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, including Rule 144, following the consummation of such transaction.

8\. MISCELLANEOUS.

(a) Further Assurances. The parties agree to cooperate fully with the other parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and agreements and to give such further written assurances, as may be reasonably requested by the other parties to better evidence and reflect the transactions described herein and contemplated hereby, and to carry into effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Expenses of Registration. All reasonable expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees of the special counsel of the Holders) incurred in connection with the registrations, filings or qualifications described herein, including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers’ and accounting fees, the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, shall be borne by the Company.

(c) Notices. Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given by the Company or a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered (i) when delivered personally or by verifiable facsimile transmission, unless such delivery is made on a day that is not a Business Day, in which case such delivery will be deemed to be made on the next succeeding Business Day, (ii) on the next Business Day after timely delivery to a reputable overnight courier and (iii) on the Business Day actually received if deposited in the U.S. mail (certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid), addressed as follows:
