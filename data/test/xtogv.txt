Form of 



for 

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION 

THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, effective as of October 10, 2008, is made by and between RENTRAK CORPORATION, an Oregon corporation (“Corporation”), and [Name of Employee], an employee of Corporation (“Employee”): 

RECITALS 

A. Corporation wishes to afford Employee the opportunity to purchase shares of its $.001 par value Common Stock. 

B. Corporation has adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan of Rentrak Corporation (the “Plan”). 

C. The Committee appointed to administer the Plan has determined that it would be to the advantage and best interest of Corporation and its shareholders to grant the Non-Qualified Stock Option Award (the “Option”) provided for in this Agreement to Employee as an inducement to remain in the service of Corporation and as an incentive for increased efforts during such service; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

1. GRANT OF OPTION   
  
1.1 Grant of Option. In consideration of Employee’s agreement to remain in the employ of Corporation or its Subsidiaries and for other good and valuable consideration, effective as of the date of this Agreement, Corporation irrevocably grants to Employee an Option to purchase any part or all of an aggregate of  shares of its $.001 par value Common Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. 

1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock covered by the Option is $11.10 per share, without commission or other charge, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13 of the Plan. 

1.3 Consideration to Corporation. In consideration of the granting of this Option by Corporation, Employee agrees to render faithful and efficient services to Corporation or any Subsidiary, with such duties and responsibilities as set forth in Employee’s employment agreement with Corporation, if any. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan confers upon Employee any right to continue in the employ of Corporation or any Subsidiary or will interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Corporation and its Subsidiaries, which are expressly reserved, to discharge Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except as provided in Employee’s employment agreement with Corporation, if any. 

1.4 Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” for termination of employment has the meaning set forth in the Employee’s employment agreement, if any, or otherwise means any discharge for material or flagrant violation of the policies and procedures of Corporation or for other performance or conduct which is materially detrimental to the best interests of Corporation, as determined by the Board. 

1.5 Adjustments in Option. The Option is subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13 of the Plan. 

2. PERIOD OF EXERCISABILITY   
  
2.1 Commencement of Exercisability.

(a) Subject to Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(c) and 2.3, the Option will vest and become exercisable if the performance criteria set forth in Exhibit A are attained as of March 31, 2011. The actual date of vesting will be the date the Committee determines such criteria have been attained, which shall occur, if at all, no 

1 

* * *

later than June 15, 2011. The performance criteria relate to the period from April 1, 2009, through March 31, 2011. The determination of whether the performance criteria have been met will be made by the Committee in its sole discretion. For purposes of this determination, the expense associated with the grant, vesting, and settlement of nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights granted on October 10, 2008, will not be included in the computation of operating income. The Committee has the authority to make any appropriate adjustments, determined in its sole discretion, to the performance criteria upon the occurrence of a significant corporate event, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of one or more businesses, the disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business, impairments of long-lived assets, the correction of an accounting error, or restatement of Corporation’s financial statements. 

(b) No portion of the Option which is unexercisable upon termination of Employee’s employment with Corporation or any Subsidiary will subsequently become exercisable. 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(a), the Option will become fully and immediately exercisable if an event occurs that constitutes a Change in Control of Corporation before the Option expires pursuant to Section 2.3. For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” is defined as the first occurrence of any of the following: 

(i) Any person (including any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, group, association, or other “person,” as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act) other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of Corporation, is or becomes a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Corporation representing more than 50 percent of the combined voting power of Corporation’s then outstanding securities; 

(ii) A majority of the directors elected at any annual or special meeting of shareholders are not individuals nominated by Corporation’s then incumbent Board; or 

(iii) The shareholders of Corporation approve (i) a merger or consolidation of Corporation with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities (defined as all issued and outstanding securities ordinarily having the right to vote at elections of Corporation’s directors) of Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Voting Securities of Corporation or of such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, (ii) a plan of complete liquidation of Corporation, or (iii) an agreement for the sale or disposition by Corporation of all or substantially all of its assets. 

2.2 Duration of Exercisability. Once the Option becomes exercisable pursuant to Section 2.1, it will remain exercisable until it becomes unexercisable under Section 2.3. 

2.3 Expiration of Option. The Option may not be exercised to any extent by anyone after the first to occur of the following events: 

(a) The determination of the Committee that the performance criteria set forth in Exhibit A have not been attained; 

(b) August 30, 2011; 

(c) Immediately upon termination of Employee’s employment with Corporation or any Subsidiary for Cause; or 

(d) On the date specified in Section 2.4(b) in connection with a Terminating Event (as that term is defined in Section 2.4(b)). 

2.4 Adjustments to and/or Cancellation of the Option.

2 

* * *

(a) Neither (i) the issuance of additional shares of stock of Corporation in exchange for adequate consideration (including services), nor (ii) the conversion of outstanding preferred shares of Corporation into Common Stock, will be deemed to require an adjustment in the shares covered by the Option or in the purchase price of shares subject to the Option pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan. In the event the Committee determines that an event has occurred affecting Corporation such that an adjustment to the Option under Section 13 of the Plan should be made but that it is not practical or feasible to make such an adjustment, such event will be deemed a Terminating Event subject to the following paragraph. 

(b) Subject to Section 13 of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control of Corporation or the occurrence of an event in accordance with the last sentence of the previous paragraph (any of such events is herein referred to as a “Terminating Event”), the Committee will determine whether a provision will be made in connection with the Terminating Event for an appropriate assumption of the Option by, or substitution of appropriate new options covering stock of, a successor corporation employing Employee or stock of an affiliate of such successor employer corporation. If the Committee determines that such an appropriate assumption or substitution will be made, the Committee will give notice of the determination to Employee and the terms of such assumption or substitution, and any adjustments made (i) to the number and kind of shares subject to the Option outstanding under the Plan (or to options issued in substitution therefor), (ii) to the Option purchase price, and (iii) to the terms and conditions of the Option, will be binding upon Employee. If the Committee determines that no assumption or substitution will be made, the Committee will give notice of this determination to Employee, whereupon Employee will have the right for a period of 30 days following the notice to exercise in full or in part the unexercised and unexpired portion of this Option, all of which will become fully and immediately vested without regard to the limitation on exercisability specified in Section 2.1(a) above. Upon the expiration of this 30-day period, the Option will expire to the extent not earlier exercised. 

(c) The Committee will exercise its discretion in connection with the determinations under this Section 2.4 in good faith and in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner with respect to all participants under the Plan.
