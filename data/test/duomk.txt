(c) No Commitments. Employee represents and warrants to Company that Employee has no outstanding commitments inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement or the services to be rendered by Employee hereunder. 




2. Termination.

(a) Events. This Agreement and Employee's employment by Company will terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Term, or (ii) the first to occur of any of the following: 

(1) Disability.

(i) Failure to Render Service. In the event Employee fails for a period of one hundred twenty (120) business days, either consecutively or in the aggregate during any twelve- (12-) month period, as a result of illness, incapacity, Disability, injury, or by reason of any statute, law, ordinance, regulation, order, judgment or decree, to render the services contemplated by this Agreement, Company, by written notice to Employee, may terminate Employee's employment. 

(ii) Disability Defined. "Disability" shall for purposes of this Agreement mean a physical or mental condition which substantially limits a major life activity and which renders Employee unable to perform the essential functions of Employee's position, even with such reasonable accommodation by Company that does not impose an undue hardship on Company. Company reserves the right, in good faith, to make the determination of Disability under this Agreement based on information supplied by Employee's medical personnel, as well as information from medical personnel selected by Company or its insurers. 

(2) Death. Employee's employment shall automatically terminate upon the death of Employee.

Termination of Employee's employment under this Section 2(a)(3) will not limit Company's rights and remedies against Employee under this Agreement, at law or in equity. 

(4) Without Cause. Company, in its absolute discretion, may terminate Employee's employment at any time without Cause and with or without notice. 

(b) Effect. Effective as of the date of the termination of Employee's employment pursuant to this Section 2, Employee's right to receive Base Salary, Benefits, expense reimbursement and other amounts (such as bonuses) will cease, provided that Company will pay to Employee such amounts, if any, which Employee has earned but are unpaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Employee's compliance with the conditions of Section 2(c) and 4 and execution of full release and settlement of all claims in connection with Employee's employment, in the event Employee's employment is terminated pursuant to Section 2(a)(4) Company will pay Employee Base Salary for the unexpired Term remaining after the date of such termination. Such payments will be in lieu of all other rights of Employee under this Agreement, at law or in equity, except as provided in the first sentence of this Section 2(b). 

(c) Post Termination Conditions. Upon termination of Employee's employment, Employee will cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance Company regarding any litigation, contract negotiation or other matter in which the benefit of Employee's knowledge or expertise may be requested by Company, including, without limitation, assisting Company, at Company's request, in the preparation of litigation (including testifying). 




3. Renewal.

Upon such expiration of the Term, (i) Company will pay to Employee all Base Salary, Benefits, expense reimbursement and other amounts, if any, earned by Employee but unpaid as of the date of such expiration and (ii) Company will continue to pay Employee's then-current Base Salary at an annualized rate (A) for a period of ninety (90) days if no Extension Notice was given to Employee, or (B) if the Extension Notice is given by Company less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term, for a period of ninety (90) days minus the number of days from the date the Extension Notice was given to Employee until the expiration date of the Term. In any event, Company's election not to renew or extend Employee's employment will not relieve Employee of any continuing obligations under the Agreement.

If Company gives Employee an Extension Notice informing Employee that Company will seek to renew or extend the Term and if Company and Employee fail to agree on the terms and conditions of an extended term prior to the expiration of the Term then, upon the expiration of the Term, (unless Employee is sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 2), Employee's employment will terminate and Employee's right to receive Base Salary, Benefits, expense reimbursement and other amounts will cease. Upon such expiration of the Term (i) Company will pay to Employee all Base Salary, Benefits, expense reimbursement and other amounts, if any, earned by Employee but unpaid as of the date of such expiration and (ii) if the Extension Notice is given less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term, Company will continue to pay Employee's then-current Base Salary at an annualized rate for a period of ninety (90) days minus the number of days from the date the Extension Notice was given to Employee until the expiration date of the Term. 

(c) Company's Discretion. The election to seek an extension of the Term will be at the sole and absolute discretion of Company.
