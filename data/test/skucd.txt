ALLIQUA, INC.

2011 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

  


1. Grant of Option. Pursuant to the Alliqua, Inc. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for Employees, Contractors, and Outside Directors of Alliqua, Inc., a Florida corporation (the “Company”), the Company grants to

  


David Johnson 

(the “Participant”),

  


an option (the “Option” or “Stock Option”) to purchase a total of Twelve Million Two Hundred Sixteen Thousand One Hundred Ninety-Five (12,216,195) full shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Optioned Shares”) at an “Option Price” equal to $0.075 per share (being equal to the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock on the Date of Grant).

  


The “Date of Grant” of this Stock Option is February 4, 2013. The “Option Period” shall commence on the Date of Grant and shall expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 4 below. The Stock Option is a Nonqualified Stock Option. This Stock Option is intended to comply with the provisions governing nonqualified stock options under the final Treasury Regulations issued on April 17, 2007, in order to exempt this Stock Option from application of Section 409A of the Code.

  


2. Subject to Plan. The Stock Option and its exercise are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the terms of the Plan shall control to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (the “Agreement”). The capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Plan shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Plan. The Stock Option is subject to any rules promulgated pursuant to the Plan by the Board or the Committee and communicated to the Participant in writing.

  


3. Vesting; Time of Exercise. The Optioned Shares shall be 100% vested and the Stock Option shall be immediately exercisable on the Date of Grant.

  


4. Term; Forfeiture.

  


a. The unexercised portion of the Stock Option that relates to Optioned Shares which are vested will terminate at the first of the following to occur:

  


i. 5 p.m. on the date the Option Period terminates;

  


ii. 5 p.m. on the date which is twelve (12) months following the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to death or Total and Permanent Disability;

  


iii. immediately upon the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company for Cause (as defined below);

  


iv. immediately upon the Participant’s violation of any non-compete or non-solicitation agreement entered into between the Company and the Participant (including, without limitation, the “Employment Agreement” (as defined below));

1

* * *

  


v. in the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company without Cause (as defined below) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined below), in either case during the first two years of the Initial Employment Term, 5 p.m. on the date which is three (3) months following the expiration of the “Initial Employment Term” (as defined below), determined as if the Participant had remained actively employed by the Company during such period;

  


vi. in the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company without Cause (as defined below) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined below), in either case after the first two years of the Initial Employment Term, 5 p.m. on the date which is three (3) months following the expiration of the “Initial Employment Term” (as defined below) or any “Renewal Term” (as defined below), as the case may be, determined as if the Participant had remained actively employed by the Company during such period;

  


vii. 5 p.m. on the date which is ninety (90) days following the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service for any reason not otherwise specified in this Section 4.a.; and

  


viii. 5 p.m. on the date the Company causes any portion of the Stock Option to be forfeited pursuant to Section 7 hereof.

  


b. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “Cause”, “Good Reason”, “Initial Employment Term”, and “Renewal Term” each shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Executive Employment Agreement, by and between the Participant and the Company, dated February 4, 2013 (the “Employment Agreement”).

  


5. Who May Exercise. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 3 and 4 above, during the lifetime of the Participant, the Stock Option may be exercised only by the Participant, or by the Participant’s guardian or personal or legal representative. If the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to his death prior to the dates specified in Section 4.a. hereof, and the Participant has not exercised the Stock Option as to the maximum number of vested Optioned Shares as set forth in Section 3 hereof as of the date of death, the following persons may exercise the exercisable portion of the Stock Option on behalf of the Participant at any time prior to the earliest of the dates specified in Section 4.a. hereof: the personal representative of his estate, or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Stock Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Participant; provided that the Stock Option shall remain subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the Plan, and Applicable Laws, rules, and regulations.

  


6. No Fractional Shares. The Stock Option may be exercised only with respect to full shares, and no fractional share of stock shall be issued.

  


7. Manner of Exercise. Subject to such administrative regulations as the Committee may from time to time adopt, the Stock Option may be exercised by the delivery of written notice to the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Option is to be exercised, the date of exercise thereof (the “Exercise Date”) which shall be at least three (3) days after giving such notice unless an earlier time shall have been mutually agreed upon. On the Exercise Date, the Participant shall deliver to the Company consideration with a value equal to the total Option Price of the shares to be purchased, payable as follows: (a) cash, check, bank draft, or money order payable to the order of the Company, (b) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) owned by the Participant on the Exercise Date, valued at its Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, and which the Participant has not acquired from the Company within six (6) months prior to the Exercise Date, (c) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, by delivery (including by FAX) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions from the Participant to a broker or dealer, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to sell certain of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or to pledge such shares as collateral for a loan and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay such purchase price, and/or (d) in any other form of valid consideration that is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event that shares of Restricted Stock are tendered as consideration for the exercise of a Stock Option, a number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of the Stock Option equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock used as consideration therefor shall be subject to the same restrictions and provisions as the Restricted Stock so tendered.

* * *

Upon payment of all amounts due from the Participant, the Company shall either cause certificates for the Common Stock then being purchased to be delivered to the Participant (or the person exercising the Participant’s Stock Option in the event of his death) or cause the Common Stock then being purchased to be electronically registered in the Participant’s name (or the name of the person exercising the Participant’s Stock Option in the event of his death), promptly after the Exercise Date. The obligation of the Company to deliver or register such shares of Common Stock shall, however, be subject to the condition that, if at any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the listing, registration, or qualification of the Stock Option or the Common Stock upon any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with, the Stock Option or the issuance or purchase of shares of Common Stock thereunder, then the Stock Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not reasonably acceptable to the Committee.

If the Participant fails to pay for any of the Optioned Shares specified in such notice or fails to accept delivery thereof, then that portion of the Participant’s Stock Option and right to purchase such Optioned Shares may be forfeited by the Participant.

  


8. Nonassignability. The Stock Option is not assignable or transferable by the Participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

  


9. Rights as Shareholder. The Participant will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any of the Optioned Shares until the issuance of a certificate or certificates to the Participant or the registration of such shares in the Participant’s name for the shares of Common Stock. The Optioned Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of such certificate or certificates. The Participant, by his or her execution of this Agreement, agrees to execute any documents requested by the Company in connection with the issuance of the shares of Common Stock.

  


10. Adjustment of Number of Optioned Shares and Related Matters. The number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Stock Option, and the Option Prices thereof, shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Articles 11 - 13 of the Plan.

  


11. Nonqualified Stock Option. The Stock Option shall not be treated as an Incentive Stock Option.

* * *

  


12. Voting. The Participant, as record holder of some or all of the Optioned Shares following exercise of this Stock Option, has the exclusive right to vote, or consent with respect to, such Optioned Shares until such time as the Optioned Shares are transferred in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that this Section shall not create any voting right where the holders of such Optioned Shares otherwise have no such right.

  


13. Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that remedies at law will be inadequate remedies for breach of this Agreement and consequently agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable by specific performance. The remedy of specific performance shall be cumulative of all of the rights and remedies at law or in equity of the parties under this Agreement.

  


14. Participant’s Representations. Notwithstanding any of the provisions hereof, the Participant hereby agrees that he will not exercise the Stock Option granted hereby, and that the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to the Participant hereunder, if the exercise thereof or the issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the Participant or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority. Any determination in this connection by the Company shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The obligations of the Company and the rights of the Participant are subject to all Applicable Laws, rules, and regulations.

  


15. Investment Representation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Participant hereby represents and warrants to the Company, that:

  


a. The Common Stock that will be received upon exercise of the Stock Option are acquired for investment purposes only for the Participant’s own account and not with a view to or in connection with any distribution, re-offer, resale or other disposition not in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and applicable state securities laws;

  


b. The Participant, alone or together with the Participant’s representatives, possesses such expertise, knowledge and sophistication in financial and business matters generally, and in the type of transactions in which the Company proposes to engage in particular, that the Participant is capable of evaluating the merits and economic risks of acquiring Common Stock upon the exercise of the Stock Option and holding such Common Stock;

  


c. The Participant has had access to all of the information with respect to the Common Stock underlying the Stock Option that the Participant deems necessary to make a complete evaluation thereof, and has had the opportunity to question the Company concerning the Stock Option;

  


d. The decision of the Participant to acquire the Common Stock upon exercise of the Stock Option for investment has been based solely upon the evaluation made by the Participant;

  


e. The Participant understand that the Common Stock underlying the Stock Option constitutes “restricted securities” under the Securities Act and has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the Participant’s investment intent as expressed herein. The Participant further understands that the Common Stock underlying the Stock Option must be held indefinitely unless it is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available;

f. The Participant acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Common Stock underlying the Stock Option and that the certificates evidencing such Common Stock will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of such Common Stock unless it is registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company and any other legend required under applicable state securities laws; and

  


g. The Participant is an “accredited investor,” as such term is defined in Section 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

  


16. Participant’s Acknowledgments. The Participant acknowledges that a copy of the Plan has been made available for his review by the Company, and represents that he is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts this Stock Option subject to all the terms and provisions thereof.

18. No Right to Continue Service or Employment. Nothing herein shall be construed to confer upon the Participant the right to continue in the employ or to provide services to the Company or any Subsidiary, whether as an Employee or as a Contractor or as an Outside Director, or interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to discharge the Participant as an Employee, Contractor or Outside Director at any time.

  


19. Legal Construction. In the event that any one or more of the terms, provisions, or agreements that are contained in this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term, provision, or agreement shall not affect any other term, provision, or agreement that is contained in this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term, provision, or agreement had never been contained herein.

  


20. Covenants and Agreements as Independent Agreements. Each of the covenants and agreements that is set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as a covenant and agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action of the Participant against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the covenants and agreements that are set forth in this Agreement.

  


21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement together with the Plan supersede any and all other prior understandings and agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitute the sole and only agreements between the parties with respect to the said subject matter, including, without limitation, the Employment Agreement.
