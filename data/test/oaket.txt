THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into this 10th day of September, 2014 by and between Darrell Finneman, a resident of the State of Colorado (“Employee”), and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc., a Minnesota corporation having its principal office at 315 Manitoba Avenue, Suite 200, Wayzata, Minnesota (the “Company”).

WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee, and Employee desires to accept such employment, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, during his employment with the Company, Employee will have access to the Company’s confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. Employee and the Company agree that it is in the best interests of the Company to protect its confidential, proprietary and trade secret information, to prevent unfair competition by former employees following separation of their employment and to secure cooperation from former employees with respect to matters related to their employment with the Company; and

WHEREAS, Employee acknowledges that his receipt of compensation and benefits under this Agreement depends on, among other things, his agreement to abide by the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and other covenants contained in this Agreement in Sections 9 and 10 below.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the respective agreements of the Company and Employee as set forth below, the Company and Employee, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. Term. Effective as of October 1, 2014 (the “Effective Date”), the Company hereby employs Employee, and Employee hereby accepts such employment on the terms and conditions set forth herein, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending four (4) years later, unless sooner terminated pursuant hereto (the “Initial Term”). The Company and Employee shall provide one another with written notice ninety (90) days prior to the fourth anniversary of the Effective Date, and on subsequent yearly anniversaries of the Effective Date, of their intention to terminate this Agreement or to extend the Agreement under the terms and conditions hereof for successive, additional one (1) year periods, subject to early termination pursuant hereto (each a “Renewal Term”). The Agreement will be extended only if both the Company and Employee agree to extend the Agreement. The Initial Term together with any Renewal Term(s) is herein referred to as the “Term.” If Employee remains employed by the Company after the Term, then such employment shall be according to such terms and conditions as the Company may establish from time to time.

2. Services. The Company hereby agrees to employ Employee in the role of the Company’s “Executive Vice President, Land” and Employee hereby accepts such employment with the Company on the terms and conditions set forth herein. Employee shall perform all activities and services as the Company’s Executive Vice President, Land, which shall include such duties and responsibilities as the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), Chief Executive Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer may from time-to-time reasonably prescribe (the “Services”). Employee shall use his best efforts to make himself available to render such Services to the best of his abilities. The Services shall be performed in a good professional and workmanlike manner by Employee, to the Company’s reasonable satisfaction.

3. Location. Employee’s position will be based out of the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. It is anticipated that the Company will enter into a lease for office space in that area reasonably promptly after the Effective Date. Employee acknowledges and agrees that his position will from time to time require travel, including without limitation to the Company’s principal office, which is currently located in Wayzata, Minnesota.

4. At-Will Relationship. Employee’s employment with the Company shall be entirely “at-will,” meaning that either Employee or the Company may terminate such employment relationship at any time for any reason or for no reason at all, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. The date upon which Employee’s termination of employment with the Company occurs is the “Termination Date.” For purposes of Section 8(b)(x) and (y) of this Agreement only, with respect to the timing of any payments thereunder, the “Termination Date” shall mean the date on which a “separation from service” has occurred for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and the regulations and guidance thereunder.

5. Compensation. In consideration for Employee entering into this Agreement with the Company and performing the Services required hereunder during the Term, the Company shall provide Employee with the following compensation while Employee is employed by the Company during the Term:

(a) Salary. The Company shall pay Employee an annualized base salary according to this Section 5(a) (the “Salary”), which salary shall be payable to Employee in accordance with the Company’s customary payroll practices. Employee’s annualized Salary shall initially be $220,000. Thereafter, Employee’s annualized Salary shall be subject to review and adjustment (but not below $220,000) in the discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board.

(b) Annual Bonus. For each calendar year during the Term commencing with the 2014 calendar year, Employee shall be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus at the discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board (the “Annual Bonus”). The Annual Bonus, if any, shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee, based upon a mix of Compensation Committee discretion and/or performance relative to performance goals, which goals may be tied to Company performance and/or individual performance specific to Employee’s role, and to be paid in such form as the Compensation Committee or Board may determine, but no later than March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year for which such bonus is earned. The executive officer annual cash bonus plan currently offers a bonus opportunity ranging from 0-200% of base salary, based on a mix of performance goals and discretionary factors, which the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to tailor individually to Employee’s role. Any Annual Bonus for the 2014 calendar year shall be pro-rated based on Employee’s days of employment with the Company during 2014. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall obligate the Company to pay any bonus to Employee at any time, and the terms and structure of any annual cash bonus plan used to determine an Annual Bonus is in the sole discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee and Board.

(c) Initial Restricted Stock Grant. As of the Effective Date, Employee shall receive a restricted stock grant of 40,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Restricted Stock Award”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of a restricted stock award agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A to be entered into between the Company and Employee dated the Effective Date (the “Restricted Stock Agreement”). The restricted stock included in the Restricted Stock Award shall vest in four equal annual installments on October 1st of each year from 2015 through 2018, subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances as specified in the Restricted Stock Agreement.

(d) Annual Long-Term Incentive Grant. In connection with the long-term incentive grant determination process undertaken by the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board, commencing with year-end 2014, Employee shall be eligible to receive a long-term incentive grant at the discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board (the “Annual Grant”). The Annual Grant, if any, shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee, based upon a mix of Compensation Committee discretion and/or performance relative to performance goals, which goals may be tied to Company performance and/or individual performance specific to Employee’s role, with any grant vesting in installments following grant as determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board. The executive officer annual long-term incentive plan currently offers a restricted stock grant opportunity ranging from 0-300% of base salary, based on a mix of discretionary factors and performance goals, which the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to tailor individually to Employee’s role. Any Annual Grant for the 2014 calendar year shall be pro-rated based on Employee’s days of employment with the Company during 2014. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall obligate the Company to make any incentive grant to Employee at any time, and the terms and structure of any long-term incentive plan used to determine an Annual Grant is in the sole discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee and Board.
