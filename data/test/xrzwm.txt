4.3 If the Optionee is no longer Employed by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Related Companies due to the Optionee’s death or Disability (as defined in Sections 4.5 below), this Stock Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of any such termination.

4.4 If the Optionee is no longer Employed by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Related Companies due to the Optionee’s Retirement (as defined in Sections 4.6 below), this Stock Option shall continue to vest as if the Optionee continued to be Employed by the Company through each applicable vesting date specified in Section 4.1 above).

7. Special Rules Regarding Restrictive Covenants. In the event that the Optionee fails to comply with any of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 7, the Company may terminate outstanding Stock Options.

7.1 Confidentiality. The obligation of confidentiality by the Optionee set forth in the Company's agreements(s) with the Optionee or policies of the Company binding on or covering the Optionee shall remain in effect for perpetuity regardless of any cessation of payment pursuant to this Agreement, such that the Optionee shall not disclose confidential information of or pertaining to the Company at any time.

7.2 Non-Competition. During the period of a Optionee’s employment and for one year thereafter (or two years thereafter, in the event of a termination following a Change of Control), the Optionee shall not, without the Company's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected as a director, officer, employee, partner, consultant or otherwise with, any profit or non-profit business or organization in the United States that, directly or indirectly, manufactures, markets, distributes or sells (through wholesale, retail or direct marketing channels including, but not limited to, mail order and internet distribution) vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbal products, sports nutrition products, bodybuilding formulas or homeopathic remedies (the "Competitive Products") if, except with respect to the companies listed below, the sale/distribution of the Competitive Products represent one third (1/3) or more of such business or organization’s gross sales in the proceeding twelve (12) months from the Optionee’s termination of employment date (the "Competitive Business"); provided, however, that the Optionee can work for a business or organization (other than the companies listed below) that sells Competitive Products that is less than one third (1/3) of such gross sales only if the Optionee is not directly or indirectly involved in that part of the business or organization that deals with, or has knowledge of, the Competitive Products.

7.3 Non-Solicitation. During the period of a Optionee’s employment and for one year thereafter (or two years thereafter, in the event of a termination following a Change of Control), the Optionee shall not directly or indirectly (i) cause any person or entity to, either for the Optionee or for any other person, business, partnership, association, firm, company or corporation, hire from the Company or attempt to hire, divert or take away from the Company, any of the officers or employees of the Company who were employed by the Company during the twelve (12) months prior to the termination date of the Optionee’s employment; or (ii) cause any other person or entity to, either for the Optionee or for any other person, business, partnership, association, firm, company or corporation, attempt to divert or take away from the Company or its subsidiaries any of the business or vendors of the Company.

7.4 Remedies. The Optionee and the Company acknowledge that the restrictions imposed by this Section 7 are reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, and that the Company would not be willing to offer the Stock Option pursuant to this Agreement in the absence of such agreement. The Optionee agrees that any breach of this 7 by the Optionee would cause irreparable damage to the Company and that in the event of such breach the Company shall have, in addition to any and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent the violation of any obligations hereunder, without the necessity of posting a bond, plus if the Company prevails with respect to any dispute between the Company and the Optionee as to the interpretation, terms, validity or enforceability of this Section 7, the recovery of any and all costs and expenses incurred by the Company, including reasonable attorneys’ fees in connection with the enforcement of this Section 7. The Optionee further acknowledges and agrees that any period of time during which he or she is in violation of the covenants set forth in this Section 7 shall be added to the applicable restricted period. Resort to such equitable relief shall not be construed to be a waiver of any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for damages or otherwise.

7.5 Forfeiture and Repayment. The Optionee may be required to repay to the Company the proceeds received in connection with, or return to the Company, the Option Shares: (i) if during the course of employment the Optionee engages in conduct, or it is discovered that the Optionee has engaged in conduct, that is (x) materially adverse to the interest of the Company, which include failures to comply with the Company's written rules or regulations and material violations of any agreement with the Company, (y) fraud, or (z) conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities occurring during or after employment; (ii) if during the course of employment, the Optionee competes with, or engages in the solicitation and/or diversion of customers, vendors or employees of, the Company or it is discovered that the executive employee has engaged in such conduct; (iii) if following termination of employment, the Optionee violates any post-termination obligations or duties owed to, or any agreement with, the Company, which includes this Agreement, any employment agreement and other agreements restricting post-employment conduct; (iv) if following termination of employment, the Company discovers facts that would have supported a termination for Cause had such facts been known to the Company before the termination of employment; and (v) if compensation that is promised or paid to the Optionee is required to be forfeited and/or repaid to the Company pursuant to applicable regulatory requirements as in effect from time to time and/or such forfeiture or repayment affects amounts or benefits payable under this Agreement.

  


8. Non-transferability.

8.1 Except as provided herein, this Stock Option, and any rights or interests therein, (i) shall not be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee), other than by testamentary disposition by the Optionee or by the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) shall not be pledged, encumbered or otherwise hypothecated in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee) and (iii) shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar legal process.
