Special meetings of stockholders shall be held in the same place or places and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or Secretary upon direction of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee or upon written request of the stockholders holding fifty percent (50%) of the stock entitled to vote.

Section 2. Notice of Meetings. Unless otherwise required by statute, notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, not less than five nor more than sixty days before the day on which the meeting is to be held, by mailing to each stockholder, postage prepaid, or by an approved electronic process, a written or printed notice thereof addressed to him at his last known post office address appearing on the books of the Company. Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and if a special meeting the purpose or purposes thereof.

Notice of any such meeting need not be given to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy or to any stockholder who shall, in person or by attorney thereunto authorized in writing or by telegram, waive notice of such meeting. Unless otherwise required by statute, notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders need not be given.

Section 3. Quorum. At each meeting of stockholders a majority in person or by proxy in interest of all the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business unless by statutory requirement a greater majority is necessary. If the necessary majority of stockholders be not present in person or by proxy at any meeting any stockholder or officer present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. 

Section 4. Voting. Except as otherwise may be required by law or by the By-Laws, at each meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to only one vote for each share of Common Stock held by him and registered in his name on the books of the Company at the time of such meeting or at the date fixed as a record date for the determination of the stockholder entitled to vote pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of Article VI of the By-Laws. In case the transfer books of the Company shall not have been closed and no date shall have been fixed as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote, as permitted by the provisions of said Section 3, no share of stock shall be voted at any election of directors which has been transferred on the books of the Company within thirty days next preceding such election.

Any stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy in writing or by an approved electronic method. The attendance at any meeting of a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless the stockholder so attending shall, in writing, so notify the Secretary of the meeting at any time prior to the voting of the proxy.

Every person holding stock in any representative or fiduciary capacity may represent the same at all meetings of stockholders and may vote thereon as a stockholder; and every person who shall have pledged his stock as collateral security may, nevertheless, represent the same at all such meetings and may vote thereon as a stockholder, unless in the transfer to the pledge on the books of the Company he shall have expressly empowered the pledge to vote thereon, in which case only the pledge or his proxy may represent his stock and vote thereon.

At each meeting of stockholders all matters, other than those matters which are expressly regulated by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, shall be decided by a vote of the majority in interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote.

Every stockholder of record entitled to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy the number of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected or to cumulate said shares so as to give one candidate as many votes as the number of Directors multiplied by the number of shares of stock shall equal, or to distribute them on the same principle among as many candidates as he shall see fit.

The Company and its transfer agent’s registrars, if any, shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any shares or share of stock as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it or they shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by the Statutes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky; provided, however, that whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and not absolutely, and written notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary of the Company or to any of its transfer agents, such fact shall be expressed in the entry of the transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an intrastate public offering by the Company of its stock solely to bona fide residents of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is made, and such offering is not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, transfer of all shares of stock purchased pursuant to such public offering shall not be permitted or recognized by the Company, when made during the period of any such public offering or for such period of time thereafter as the Board of Directors in its uncontrolled discretion shall deem necessary, expedient and appropriate, unless there is submitted to the Company satisfactory evidence that the transfer is to be made to a bona fide resident of the Commonwealth of Kentucky who is purchasing for investment purposes and with no intention at such time to redistribute the stock to others.
