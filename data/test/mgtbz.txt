1.3 Change in Control. “Change in Control” shall mean any of the following events:

  


a. (i) An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the “Voting Securities”) by any “Person” (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)) immediately after which such Person has “Beneficial Ownership” (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of forty percent (40%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a “Non-Control Acquisition” (as defined below) shall not constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control. A “Non-Control Acquisition” shall mean an acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y) any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a “Subsidiary”), or (2) the Company or any Subsidiary.

  


(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because a Person (the “Subject Person”) gained Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur; or

b. Approval by stockholders of the Company without approval by the Employee in his capacity as a stockholder or director or otherwise of:

(i) A merger, consolidation or reorganization involving the Company, unless: (1) the stockholders of the Company, immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the “Surviving Corporation”) in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization, (2) the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or reorganization constitute at least three-fifths of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (3) no Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary) becomes Beneficial Owner of twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation’s then outstanding voting securities as a result of such merger, consolidation or reorganization, a transaction described in clauses (1) through (3) shall herein be referred to as a “Non-Control Transaction”; or

(ii) An agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, to any Person, other than a transfer to a Subsidiary, in one transaction or a series of related transactions.

(iii) The stockholders of the Company approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

c. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Employee’s employment is terminated prior to a Change in Control and such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control (a “Third Party”) or (ii) otherwise occurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement, the date of a Change in Control with respect to the Employee shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of the Employee’s employment.

1.4 Continuation Benefits. “Continuation Benefits” shall be the continuation of the Benefits, as defined in Section 5.1, for the period from the Termination Date to either (i) the later of the Expiration Date, or the end of the month in which the one-year anniversary of the Termination Date occurs, or (ii) such other period as specifically stated by this Agreement (the “Continuation Period”), at the Company's expense, less any normal payroll deductions, on behalf of the Employee and his dependents; provided, however, if any of the Benefits required to be provided by the Company during the Continuation Period under the Company’s benefit plans are, pursuant to the terms of such plans, not available to non-employees of the Company, the Company, at its sole cost and expense, less any normal payroll deductions, shall be required to provide such benefits as shall be reasonably available and substantially similar to the benefits provided to employees of the Company. The Company’s obligation hereunder with respect to the foregoing benefits shall also be limited to the extent that if the Employee obtains such benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's benefit plan, the Company may reduce the coverage of any benefits it is required to provide the Employee hereunder as long as the aggregate coverage and benefits of the combined benefit plans is no less favorable to the Employee than the coverage and benefits required to be provided hereunder. This definition of Continuation Benefits shall not be interpreted so as to limit any benefits to which the Employee, his dependents or beneficiaries may be entitled under any of the Company's employee benefit plans, programs or practices following the Employee's termination of employment, including, without limitation, retiree medical and life insurance benefits.

* * *

1.5 Disability. “Disability” shall mean a physical or mental infirmity which impairs the Employee's ability to substantially perform his duties with the Company for a period of three consecutive months or six months within a 12 month period, and the Employee has not returned to his full time employment prior to the Termination Date as stated in the “Notice of Termination” (as defined below).

1.7 Notice of Termination. “Notice of Termination” shall mean a written notice from the Company, or the Employee, of termination of the Employee’s employment which indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, if any, and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Employee's employment under the provision so indicated.

1.8 Severance Payment. “Severance Payment” shall mean an amount equal to the Employee’s Base Salary at the date of termination of Employee’s employment. For the purpose of the definition of “Severance Payment,” the Base Salary shall not include deferred compensation.

ARTICLE III

DUTIES

3.1 The Employee shall, during the Term (as defined below) of his employment with the Company, and subject to the direction and control of the Board, report directly to the Board and shall exercise such authority, perform such executive duties and functions and discharge such responsibilities as are reasonably associated with his executive position or as may be reasonably assigned or delegated to him from time to time by the Board, consistent with his position as Vice President of Corporate Development, Chief Operating Officer, and Secretary.

All such travel and hotel accommodations shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Company. All airplane travel shall be in the Economy class on a commercial plane. Fares paid shall not exceed the approximate equivalent published fares.

  


ARTICLE IV

COMPENSATION

  


4.1 During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall be compensated at the rate of $200,000 per annum (the “Base Salary”); provided, however, $150,000 of the Base Salary shall be deferred and not be an obligation unless and until such time that the Company raises an aggregate of $10,000,000 through either closing on financing (either debt or equity) or licensing revenues after the date of this Agreement (the “Minimum Capital Raise”). The Base Salary shall be paid to the Employee in regular installments on each of the Company's regular pay dates for executives, but no less frequently than monthly.

  


4.2 If the Minimum Capital Raise is reached during the term of this Agreement, then within ten (10) days after the date of Minimum Capital Raise (the “Capital Raise Date”), the Employee shall receive a one-time bonus (the “Capital Raise Bonus”) consisting of the deferred amount of Base Salary that the Employee would have received from the Commencement Date through the Capital Raise Date if the Base Salary was $200,000 during such period, minus the Base Salary actually received by the Employee during such period. Following the Capital Raise Date, the Employee shall thereafter be paid the Base Salary of $200,000 per annum. If this Agreement is terminated due to the Employee’s death or Disability, or if the Employee was terminated by the Company without Cause or the Employee terminates this Agreement for Good Reason, then the Capital Raise Bonus shall be payable to Employee (or his estate, as applicable) if the Minimum Capital Raise is reached prior to the Expiration Date.

4.3 As of the Commencement Date, the Company shall grant the Employee an option (the “Option”) to purchase 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable for ten years from the date of grant, with an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The Option shall vest in equal monthly installments over seventy-two (72) months from the date of grant, which vesting shall be contingent upon the continued employment of the Employee and shall contain customary terms of a stock option grant to a company executive; provided, however, that upon a Change of Control or the termination of the Employee for Good Reason or without Good Cause, the Option shall immediately vest in full. The Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option to the extent of the $100,000 per year limitation and the balance a Non-Qualified Stock Option under the Company’s equity compensation plan.

4.4 If at any time during the six (6) years after the grant of the Option, the Employee is still an employee of the Company at all times while the Company’s Common Stock is traded on a securities exchange, the Company will have an effective registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering all of the shares of common stock of the Company underlying the Option.

4.5 The Board may, at its sole discretion, award bonuses to the Employee in cash or securities of the Company. The Base Salary, and any bonus, option, or other compensation, shall be subject to deductions for all federal, state, and local taxes which it may now or may hereafter be required to deduct under applicable law.

ARTICLE VI

NON-DISCLOSURE

6.1 The Employee shall not, at any time during or after the termination of his employment hereunder, except when acting on behalf of and with the authorization of the Company, or when required by law or legal process, or where appropriate in response to regulatory authorities, make use of or disclose to any person, corporation, or other entity, for any purpose whatsoever, any trade secret or other confidential information concerning the Company’s business, finances, marketing, computerized payroll, accounting and information business, personnel and/or employee leasing business of the Company and its subsidiaries, including information relating to any customer of the Company, or any other nonpublic business information of the Company and/or its subsidiaries learned as a consequence of Employee’s employment with the Company, except for information available publicly or from other non-confidential sources (collectively referred to as the “Proprietary Information”). The Employee acknowledges that Proprietary Information, as they may exist from time to time, are valuable and unique assets of the Company, and that disclosure of any such information would cause substantial injury to the Company. Proprietary Information shall cease to be Proprietary Information, as applicable, at such time as such information becomes public other than through disclosure, directly or indirectly, by Employee in violation of this Agreement.

6.2 If Employee is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or document subpoenas, civil investigative demands, or similar process) to disclose any Proprietary Information, Employee shall, unless prohibited by law, promptly notify the Company of such request(s) so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order.

ARTICLE VII

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

  


7.1 In the event of the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company at any time, for cause and as long as the employee receives severance pay, the Employee agrees that he will not, for a period of one (1) year following such termination, directly or indirectly, enter into or become associated with or engage in any other business (whether as a partner, officer, director, shareholder, employee, consultant, or otherwise), which business is primarily involved in the development, marketing, licensing that are the same as the business i.e., the specific medicinal product of the Company or the same class of medications (curcuminoids) that are in competition with the Company's products, or which the Company was in the process of developing during the term of Employee’s employment with the Company and such development is based on actual or demonstrative planned research (a “Competitive Business”). This prohibition does not include activities with any clinical indications since there are extant medical remedies for all known indications and does not exclude allows collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies or individuals to allow potentially productive drug combinations. In the event that the employee terminates this employment for good reason or because there is a breach of contract on the part of the company then all non-compete restrictions are null and void.

8

* * *

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ownership by Employee of less than two percent of the shares of any publicly held corporation shall not violate the provisions of this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, Employee shall not during the aforesaid period of non-competition, directly or indirectly, in connection with any Competitive Business involving the same class of curcuminoids, liposomal, curcumin, nanocurcumin or PLGA Curcumin solicit any customer or employee of the Company who was a customer or employee of the Company within one year of the Termination Date, unless the other corporation enters into a joint venture or partnership for any SignPath Product. This agreement will allow volunteer help for non-profit entities, or developing another drug or medical device, or diagnostic which will not compete with approved clinical indications already assigned to SignPath Pharma, Inc. by governmental agencies and will exclude potential pharmaceutical competitors involved with the same class of drugs which would directly conflict with the Company’s business, or the Company’s demonstrable planned research or development. Any business arrangement such as partnering or a joint venture of SignPath Pharma with another company using the same class of drugs, devices, or diagnostics will be allowed.

2 If any court shall hold that the duration of non-competition or any other restriction contained in this Article VII is unenforceable, it is our intention that same shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable or, in the alternative, such judicially substituted term may be substituted therefor.

ARTICLE VIII

TERM

  


8.1 This Agreement shall be effective upon execution by both parties hereto and shall terminate on the three (3) year anniversary of the Commencement Date (the “Expiration Date”), unless sooner terminated upon the death of the Employee, or as otherwise provided herein.

Upon termination of the Employee’s employment with the Company, the Company shall pay Employee, in addition to any other payments due hereunder, the amounts due under Article IX.

9.7 Following the termination of this Agreement, Employee agrees that he will not make any negative or derogatory statements in verbal, written, electronic or any other form about the Company, including, but not limited to, a negative or derogatory statement made in, or in connection with, any article or book, on a website, in a chat room or via the internet except where such statement is required by law or regulation. Following such termination, none of the executive officers and directors shall make any negative or derogatory statements in verbal, written, electronic or any other form about the Employee, including, but not limited to, a negative or derogatory statement made in, or in connection with, any article or book, on a website, in a chat room or via the internet except where such statement is required by law or regulation.
