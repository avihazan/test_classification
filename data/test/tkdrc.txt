(e)

Limitations on Payments Related to Change in Control. The following apply notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:  
  
  
  
  
(1)

the total of the payments described in Section 11(d)(3) will be less than the amount that would cause them to be a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;  
  
  
  
  
(2)

the payment described in Section 11(d)(3) will be reduced by any compensation (in the form of cash or other benefits) received by Executive from the Company or its successor after the Change in Control and/or after Executive’s termination of employment; and  
  
  
  
  
(3)

Executive’s right to receive the payments described in Section 11(d)(3) terminates (i) immediately if before the Change in Control transaction closes, Executive terminates his employment without Good Reason, or the Company terminates Executive’s employment for Cause, or (ii) three years after a Change of Control occurs.  
  
  
  
  
(4)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this or any other agreement or plan, including Section 11(e)(1) of this Agreement, to the extent that any payment or distribution of any type to or for the benefit of the Executive by the Company (or by any affiliate of the Company, any person or entity who acquires ownership or effective control of the Company or ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s assets (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations thereunder), or any affiliate of such person or entity, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the “Total Payments”), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Excise Tax”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) only if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in the Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax   
  
  


6

basis (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax), than if the Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments. Unless the Executive shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the Determination (as defined herein). Any notice given by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’s rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation.

  


The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in this Section and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company’s expense by the Company’s independent auditors (the “Accounting Firm”). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the “Determination”), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) days of the last day of Executive’s employment. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Executive shall have the right to accept the Determination of the Accounting Firm as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to this Section, or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Executive, at the expense of the Company, in which case the determination of such second accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive.

  
  
  
(f)

If and when Executive ceases, for any reason, to be employed by the Company and the Bank, Executive must return to the Company all keys, pass cards, identification cards, cell phones, blackberries or other smart phones, tablets, electronic storage devices, company credit cards and any other property of the Company and the Bank. At the same time, Executive also must return to the Company and the Bank all originals and copies (whether in memoranda, designs, devices, electronic storage devices, tapes, manuals, and specifications) which constitute proprietary or confidential information or material of the Company, the Bank or their subsidiaries or divisions. The obligations in this paragraph include, without limitation, the return of documents and other materials which may be in Executive’s desk at work, in Executive’s car, in place of residence, or in any other location under Executive’s control.

14.

Enforcement.   
  
  
  
  
(a)

The Company, Bank and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the relationship between Executive and the Company and Bank, the agreements referred to in Sections 12 and 13 (including without limitation their scope, duration and geographic extent) are fair and reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company's and Bank’s confidential information, goodwill and other protectable interests. If a court of competent jurisdiction should decline to enforce any of those covenants and agreements, Executive, the Company and Bank request the court to reform these provisions to restrict Executive’s use of confidential information and Executive’s ability to compete with the Company or Bank to the maximum extent, in time, scope of activities and geography, the court finds enforceable.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

Executive acknowledges the Bank and the Company will suffer immediate and irreparable harm that will not be compensable by damages alone if Executive repudiates or breaches any of the provisions of Sections 12 or 13 or threatens or attempts to do so. For this reason, under these circumstances, the Company or the Bank, in addition to and without limitation of any other rights, remedies or damages available to it at law or in equity, will be entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions in order to prevent or restrain the breach, and neither the Company nor the Bank will be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting of this relief.  
  
  
  
  
15.

Effect of Covenants. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of adequate consideration for the covenants contained in Sections 12 and 13 and that the Company and the Bank are entitled to require Executive to comply with these Sections. These Sections will survive termination of this Agreement. Executive represents that if Executive’s employment is terminated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, Executive has experience and capabilities sufficient to enable Executive to obtain employment in areas which do not violate this Agreement and that the Company’s or Bank’s enforcement of a remedy by way of injunction will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood.  
  
  
  
  
16.

Jury Waiver. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF

A party’s waiver of the other party’s breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of any other breach by the breaching party.
