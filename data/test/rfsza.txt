2. Compensation and Benefits.

  


2.1 The Company shall pay to Employee during the term of employment hereunder a basic salary at the annual rate provided in Schedule A hereto. Such annual rate of salary may be changed from time to time as the parties agree and such changes shall be reflected on Schedule A when made.
