ARTICLE III

PERIOD OF EXERCISABILITY

Section 3.1. Commencement of Exercisability

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(b), (c) or (d) below, so long as the Optionee continues to be employed by the Company or any other Service Recipient, the Option shall become vested and exercisable with respect to 25% of the Shares subject to such Option on each of the first four (4) anniversaries of the Grant Date (each such date, a “Vesting Date”). To the extent this vesting schedule results in the vesting of fractional shares, the fractional shares shall be combined and be exercisable on the earliest Vesting Date.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 3.1(a) above, upon the earliest occurrence of (i) the Optionee’s death, or (ii) a termination of the Optionee’s employment by reason of the Optionee’s Disability, the Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable with respect to 100% of the Shares subject to such unvested Option immediately prior to such event (but only to the extent such Option has not otherwise terminated, been forfeited or become exercisable).

ARTICLE IV

EXERCISE OF OPTION

Section 4.1. Person Eligible to Exercise

During the lifetime of the Optionee, only the Optionee (or his or her duly authorized legal representative) may exercise the Option or any portion thereof. After the death of the Optionee, any exercisable portion of the Option may, prior to the time when the Option becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2, be exercised by the Optionee’s personal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the Optionee’s will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.

Section 4.2. Partial Exercise

Any exercisable portion of the Option or the entire Option, if then wholly exercisable, may be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the time when the Option or portion thereof becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2; provided, however, that any partial exercise shall be for whole Shares of Common Stock only.

Section 4.3. Manner of Exercise

The Option, or any exercisable portion thereof, may be exercised solely by delivering to the Secretary or his or her designee all of the following prior to the time when the Option or such portion becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2:

(a) Notice in writing signed by the Optionee or the other person then entitled to exercise the Option or portion thereof, stating that the Option or portion thereof is thereby exercised, such notice complying with all applicable rules established by the Committee;

5

* * *

  


(b) (i) Full payment (in cash or by check or by a combination thereof) for the Shares with respect to which such Option or portion thereof is exercised (provided, however, that full payment is deemed made if the Company receives cash in respect of the exercise price no later than the date on which the Company or its agent delivers or releases Shares to the Optionee or his or her agent, which date shall not be later than three (3) business days following the date on which the Option is exercised, in the event of a cashless exercise via a third party in a manner that is compliant with applicable law) or (ii) notice in writing that the Optionee elects to have the number of Shares that would otherwise be issued to the Optionee reduced by a number of Shares having an equivalent Fair Market Value to the payment that would otherwise be made by the Optionee to the Company pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection (b);

(c) (i) Full payment (in cash or by check or by a combination thereof) to satisfy the minimum withholding tax obligation with respect to which such Option or portion thereof is exercised (provided, however, that full payment is deemed made if the Company receives such payment no later than the date on which the Company must remit such withholding to the Internal Revenue Service in the event of a cashless exercise via a third party in a manner that is compliant with applicable law); or (ii) notice in writing that the Optionee elects to have the number of Shares that would otherwise be issued to the Optionee reduced by a number of Shares having an equivalent Fair Market Value to the payment that would otherwise be made by the Optionee to the Company pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection (c);

(d) A bona fide written representation and agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Committee, signed by the Optionee or other person then entitled to exercise such Option or portion thereof, stating that the Shares of Common Stock are being acquired for his or her own account, for investment and without any present intention of distributing or reselling said Shares or any of them except as may be permitted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and then applicable rules and regulations thereunder, and that the Optionee or other person then entitled to exercise such Option or portion thereof will indemnify the Company against and hold it free and harmless from any loss, damage, expense or liability resulting to the Company if any sale or distribution of the Shares by such person is contrary to the representation and agreement referred to above; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its reasonable discretion, take whatever additional actions it deems reasonably necessary to ensure the observance and performance of such representation and agreement and to effect compliance with the Act and any other federal or state securities laws or regulations; and

(e) In the event the Option or portion thereof shall be exercised pursuant to Section 4.1 by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may require an opinion of counsel acceptable to it to the effect that any subsequent transfer of Shares acquired on exercise of the Option does not violate the Act, and may issue stop-transfer orders covering such Shares. Share certificates evidencing stock issued on exercise of the Option may bear an appropriate legend referring to the provisions of subsection (d) above and the agreements herein. The written representation and agreement referred to in subsection (d) above shall, however, not be required if the Shares to be issued pursuant to such exercise have been registered under the Act, and such registration is then effective in respect of such Shares.

Such Shares shall be fully paid and nonassessable. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for Shares purchased (if certificated, or if not certificated, register the issuance of such Shares on its books and records) upon the exercise of the Option or portion thereof prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:

(a) The obtaining of approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency which the Committee shall, in its reasonable and good faith discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and

(b) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the exercise of the Option as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience or as may otherwise be required by applicable law.

Section 4.5. Rights as Shareholder

Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.4 of this Agreement, the holder of an Option shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Option or any portion thereof unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued by the Company to such holder or the Shares have otherwise been recorded in the records of the Company as owned by such holder.
