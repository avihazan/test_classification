In addition to the foregoing, all unvested stock options held by Executive shall continue to vest through the end of the Severance Period and shall be exercisable for that specific period following the end of the Severance Period as provided under the applicable stock option agreements in the case of termination of employment. As used in this Section 3.5, the Severance Period shall mean twelve (12) months after the effective date of termination. 

3.6 Compensation Payable in the Event of a Change of Control.

For purposes of this Agreement, a “Change of Control” of the Company shall mean (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the “Exchange Act”) other than an Affiliated Purchaser becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) after the date of this Agreement of securities of the Company representing at least a majority of the combined voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities ordinarily having the right to vote at elections of directors; (ii) the Company is merged or consolidated with any person other than an Affiliated Purchaser and as a result of such merger or consolidation the beneficial owners of securities of the Company before such merger or consolidation hold immediately after such merger or consolidation less than a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the surviving or resulting company ordinarily having the right to vote at elections of directors, or (iii) the Company sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to a person other than an Affiliated Purchaser.
