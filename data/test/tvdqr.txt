ARTICLE I  
STOCKHOLDERS 

Section 1.1. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Hawaii, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. 

Section 1.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only in accordance with ARTICLE VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. 

Section 1.3. Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. 

Section 1.4. Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 

Section 1.5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of one-third of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.4 of these by-laws until a quorum shall attend. 

Section 1.6. Organization. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chair of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall announce at the meeting of stockholders the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote. 

Section 1.7. Voting; Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stock-holders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and 

* * *

  


only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon. 

Section 1.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. 

If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

Section 1.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meet-ing for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 

Section 1.10. Inspectors of Election. The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. 

* * *

  


The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation, the inspectors my consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. 

Section 1.11. Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors of the corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may in-clude, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accor-dance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. 

Section 1.12. Notice of Business and Nominations. To be properly brought before any stockholders' meeting, business and nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board or the President or a majority of the whole Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before such meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before such meeting by a stockholder or stockholders who was a stockholder or were stockholders, respec-tively, of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this By-Law, who is entitled to vote for the election of Directors at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this By-Law. 

For business to be properly brought before any stockholders' meeting by a stockholder or stockholders, the stockholder or stockholders must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's or stockholders' notice shall be delivered to or received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than eighty (80) days nor earlier than ninety (90) days prior to (a) in the case of a special meeting called by such stockholder or stockholders, the date the stockholder has, or the stockholders have, as applicable, selected for such special meeting, and (b) in the case of an annual meeting, the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by such stockholder or stockholders to be timely must be so received by the Secretary of the corporation (i) not later than the close of business on the later of the eightieth (80th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the corporation and (ii) not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting. In the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming all of the nominees for 

* * *

  


director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's or stockholders' notice required by this By-Law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by this By-Law shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (i) not later than the close of business on the later of the eightieth (80th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting and (ii) not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. 

A stockholder's notice to the Secretary of the corporation shall set forth as to each matter that the stockholder proposes to bring before such meeting (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before such meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at such meeting of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf such nomination or proposal of business is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the securities of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; and (d) any material interest of such stockholder and such beneficial owner in such nomination and such business. 

Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that the nomination or business that the stockholder proposes to bring before such meeting was not properly brought before such meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. 

For purposes of this By-Law: 

(a) "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Ex-change Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
