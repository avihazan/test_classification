Exhibit 10.4



THIS AGREEMENT (“Agreement”), by and between the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, a federally chartered corporation (“Company”), and Edward McGreen (“Executive”), is effective as of April 17, 2009 (the “Effective Date”). In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

2\. Period of Employment. The term of this Agreement shall be indefinite and terminate according to the provisions in Section 10. 

3\. Executive Representations. Executive represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not bound by any restrictive covenants and has no prior or other obligations or commitments of any kind that would in any way prevent, restrict, hinder or interfere with Executive’s acceptance of continued employment or the performance of all duties and services hereunder to the fullest extent of Executive’s ability and knowledge. 

4\. Duties. During the Period of Employment, the Executive shall be employed as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Capital Markets Officer with such duties that are assigned from time to time as appropriate to such position. While employed by the Company, Executive agrees to devote Executive’s full business time and efforts exclusively on behalf of the Company and to competently and diligently discharge Executive’s duties. Executive may (i) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (ii) deliver lectures and fulfill speaking engagements, or (iii) manage personal affairs, so long as such activities under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) do not interfere, in any substantive respect, with the Executive’s responsibilities hereunder or conflict in any material way with the business of the Company or the Company’s Code of Ethics or any other applicable policies. 

5\. Compensation. 

(a) Salary. During the Period of Employment, the Company shall pay the Executive an annual base salary (the “Base Salary”) of not less than $293,900.00, paid in accordance with the Company’s payroll and compensation practices. The Base Salary shall be reviewed annually. Based upon such review, the Company may increase the Executive’s Base Salary. Any increase in Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. 

(b) Bonus Programs. The Executive shall participate in the Company’s Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive Plans. Incentive targets and maximums are set by the Board of Directors and may increase or decrease based upon market data and/or other studies conducted by the Company and the Board, at its discretion, but in no event shall Executive’s target under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan be set lower than 30% of base salary unless as part of a nondiscriminatory cost reduction plan applicable to the Bank’s total compensation budget. 

6\. Retirement Benefits. Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company’s retirement benefit programs, including any pension plan, 401(k) plan, or benefit equalization plan established for senior executives. 

* * *

##### 

7\. Other Benefit Plans; Vacation. The Executive and his eligible family members shall be entitled to participate in any group and/or executive life, hospitalization or disability insurance plan, health program, vacation policy, or other fringe benefits of the Company on terms generally applicable to the Company’s senior executives, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of such plans and programs. 

8\. Perquisites. The Company shall provide the Executive the following perquisites, or as otherwise mutually agreed: financial planning not to exceed $2,000.00 annually. 

9\. Regular Reimbursed Business Expenses. The Company shall promptly reimburse the Executive for all expenses and disbursements reasonably incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder during the Period of Employment upon proper submission in accordance with Company policy. 

10\. Termination. 

(a) Death or Disability. This Agreement and the Period of Employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive’s death. If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has occurred (pursuant to the definition of “Disability” set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice of its intention to terminate the Executive’s employment. In such event, the Executive’s employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the thirtieth day after receipt by the Executive of such notice given at any time after a period of ninety (90) consecutive days of Disability or a period of one hundred twenty (120) days of Disability within any twelve (12) consecutive months, and, in either case, while such Disability is continuing (“Disability Effective Date”); provided that, within the thirty (30) days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive’s duties. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means the Executive’s inability, as the result of illness or incapacity, to substantially perform his duties hereunder, with reasonable accommodation, as evidenced by a certificate signed either by a physician mutually acceptable to the Company and the Executive or, if the Company and the Executive cannot agree upon a physician, by a physician selected by agreement of a physician designated by the Company and a physician designated by the Executive; provided, however, that if such physicians cannot agree upon a third physician within thirty (30) days, such third physician shall be designated by the American Arbitration Association. 

(b) By the Company for Cause. During the Period of Employment after the Effective Date, the Company may terminate the Executive’s employment immediately for “Cause.” For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean that Executive: 

(i) shall have been convicted of (or pled guilty or nolo contendere to) a felony;  
(ii) shall have committed willful acts of misconduct that materially impair the goodwill or business of the Company or cause material damage to its property, goodwill, or business monetarily or otherwise;  
(iii) shall have willfully breached the representation in Section 3 of this Agreement;  
(iv) shall have a willful and continued failure to perform his material duties; or  
  
* * *

##### 

(v) shall have willfully violated any material policies of the Company contained in the Company’s Code of Ethics to the extent such acts would provide grounds for a termination for Cause with respect to other employees.  
  
No act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be considered “willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive’s action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. A termination of the Executive’s employment for Cause shall be effected in accordance with the following procedures. The Company shall give the Executive written notice (“Notice of Cause for Termination”) of its intention to terminate the Executive’s employment for Cause, setting forth in reasonable detail the specific conduct of the Executive that it considers to constitute Cause and the specific provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies, and stating the date, time and place of the Board Meeting for Cause. The “Board Meeting for Cause” means a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”) at which the Executive’s termination for Cause will be considered, that takes place not less than ten (10) and not more than twenty (20) business days after the Executive receives the Notice of Cause for Termination. The Executive shall be given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard at the Board Meeting for Cause. The Executive’s termination for Cause shall be effective when and if a resolution is duly adopted at the Board Meeting for Cause by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the Board of the Company, stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board of the Company, the Executive conducted himself as described in the Notice of Cause for Termination, and that such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement. 

(c) By Executive for Good Reason. During the Period of Employment, the Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason upon written notice. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean (i) the assignment of duties to Executive that are materially and adversely inconsistent with Executive’s position, (ii) any material diminution in Executive’s authority, duties or responsibilities, (iii) a reduction in Executive’s Base Salary or annual and long-term bonus opportunity unless as part of a nondiscriminatory cost reduction plan applicable to the Bank’s total compensation budget, (iv) a material change by the Company in the geographic location in which the Executive is required to perform his services, or (v) material breach of this Agreement by the Company. If (I) Executive provides written notice to the Company of the occurrence of Good Reason within ninety (90) days after Executive has knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason, which notice shall specifically identify the circumstances which Executive believes constitute Good Reason; (II) the Company fails to correct the circumstances within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice; and (III) Executive resigns fifteen (15) days after the Company fails to correct such circumstances; then Executive shall be considered to have terminated for Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement. 

(d) Other than for Cause or Good Reason. The Executive or the Company may terminate this Agreement for any reason other than for Good Reason or Cause, respectively, upon ninety (90) days’ written notice to the Company or Executive, as the case may be. If the Executive terminates the Agreement for any reason, he shall have no liability to the Company or its affiliates solely as a result thereof. If the Company terminates the Agreement, or if the Agreement terminates because of the death of the Executive, or if, as a result of a merger, consolidation, or other corporate combination, the obligations of the Company shall be as set forth in Section 11 hereof. 

(e) Notice of Termination. A termination by the Company or by the Executive sha1l be communicated by a Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 23 of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Notice of Termination” means a written notice that (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable 

* * *

##### 

detail, if necessary, the basis for termination of the Executive’s employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date. The failure by the Executive or Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of the basis for termination shall not waive any right of such party hereunder or preclude such party from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his or its rights hereunder. 

(f) Date of Termination. “Date of Termination” means the date specified in the Notice of Termination, provided, however, that if the Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be. 

11\. Obligations of the Company Upon Termination. The following provisions describe the obligations of the Company to the Executive under this Agreement upon termination of his employment. However, except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights which the Executive may have under applicable law, under any other agreement with the Company, or under any compensation, pension, thrift or other benefit plan, program, policy or practice of the Company. 

(a) Termination by the Company for Cause, by the Executive without Good Reason, or due to Death or Disability. If the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason, or due to the Executive’s death or Disability, he shall be entitled to his Base Salary, accrued but unpaid bonus for any year prior to the year of termination, and accrued vacation through his Date of Termination and all other vested benefits under the terms of the Company’s employee benefit plans, subject to the terms of such plans. 

(b) Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason or by Reason of Merger or Change of Control. In addition to the items in Section 11(a), if the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason or because of merger or change of control (in a situation where cause does not also exist), he shall be entitled, upon execution of a release of claims (exclusive of claims for indemnification under Section 13 or under Company benefit plans) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and without subsequent revocation within the period described in such release, to severance payments, in lieu of any other severance benefits, equal to one (1) times the Executive’s Base Salary, as in effect on the Date of Termination, plus (i) one (1) times Executive’s targeted annual incentive award in effect for the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs (or the targeted annual incentive award for the prior year if such has not then been determined), (ii) the annual incentive award for the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs and prorated for the portion of the calendar year in which the Executive was employed, (iii) the unpaid long-term incentive award for any Performance Period (as such term is defined under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan Document (the “LTIP”) ending prior to the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, and (iv) a pro-rated long-term incentive award for any long-term incentive awards for which the Performance Period has not ended as of the Date of Termination, with such pro-rated award to be calculated in accordance with the terms of the LTIP as if the termination was due to death, disability or normal retirement. The Executive also shall be entitled to any benefits mandated under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), provided that the Company will continue paying its portion of the medical and/or dental insurance premiums for the one year period following the Date of Termination. The annual and long-term incentive awards provided under this Section 11(b), (ii) and (iv) will be paid at target for individual/team goals and based on the calendar year actual results for Company-wide goals, and at the regular time that such payments are made to all employees in the plans, and shall be payable notwithstanding any terms of such plans to the contrary

##### 

which otherwise require continued employment to receive an award. The Base Salary amount and the amounts provided for under this Section 11(b), (i) and (iii) shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) days of the date the release becomes effective. Payments under this Section 11(b) shall be paid or provided only at the time of a termination of the Executive’s employment that constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”) and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder. Further, if the Executive is a “specified employee” as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, any payments described under this Section 11(b) shall be delayed for a period of six (6) months following the Executive’s separation from service to the extent and up to an amount necessary to ensure such payments are not subject to the penalties and interest under Section 409A of the Code. If the payments are delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first day following the end of such six (6) month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without resulting in a prohibited distribution), the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Executive during such period, plus interest credited from the date of the Executive’s separation from service to the date of payment at the “applicable federal rate” provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code in effect as of the date of such separation from service. 

12\. Mitigation. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any severance benefits payable to the Executive shall not be subject to reduction for any compensation received from other employment. 

13\. Indemnification. The Company shall maintain, for the benefit of the Executive, director and officer liability insurance in form at least as comprehensive as, and in an amount that is at least equal to, that maintained by the Company for its Directors. In addition, the Executive shall be indemnified by the Company against liability as an officer of the Company and any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law provided, however, that the Company need not indemnify Executive for actions taken in bad faith, fraud or for breach of Executive’s fiduciary duties to the Company. The Executive’s rights under this Section 13 shall continue so long as he may be subject to such liability, whether or not this Agreement may have terminated prior thereto. 

14\. Executive Covenants. 

(a) General. The Executive and the Company understand and agree that the purpose of the provisions of this Section 14 is to protect legitimate business interests of the Company, as more fully described below, and is not intended to impair or infringe upon the Executive’s right to work, earn a living, or acquire and possess property from the fruits of his labor.

Any such cooperation shall be performed at times scheduled taking into consideration the Executive’s other commitments, and the Executive shall be compensated at a reasonable hourly or per diem rate to be agreed by the parties. The Executive shall also be reimbursed for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. The Executive shall not be required to perform such cooperation to the extent it conflicts with any requirements of exclusivity of service for or other obligations to be performed on behalf of another employer or otherwise, nor in any manner that in the good faith belief of the Executive would conflict with his rights under or ability to enforce this Agreement. 

17\. Assistance with Claims. Executive agrees that, for the period beginning on the Effective Date, and continuing for a reasonable period after Executive’s termination date, Executive will assist the Company in defense of any claims that may be made against the Company, and will assist the Company in the prosecution of any claims that may be made by the Company, to the extent that such claims may relate to services performed by Executive for the Company. Executive agrees to promptly inform the Company if he becomes aware of any lawsuits involving such claims that may be filed against the Company. The Company agrees to provide legal counsel to Executive in connection with such assistance (to the extent legally permitted), and to reimburse Executive for all of Executive’s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, including travel expenses. For periods after Executive’s employment with the Company terminates, the Company agrees to provide reasonable compensation to Executive for such assistance. Executive also agrees to promptly inform the Company, if permitted by law, if he is asked to assist in any investigation of the Company (or its actions) that may relate to services performed by Executive for the Company, regardless of whether a lawsuit has then been filed against the Company with respect to such investigation. The Executive shall not be required to perform such cooperation to the extent it conflicts with any requirements of exclusivity of service for or other obligations to be performed on behalf of another employer or otherwise, nor in any manner that in the

good faith belief of the Executive would conflict with his rights under or ability to enforce this Agreement. 

18\. Publicity. Neither party shall issue, without consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, any press release or make any public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the employment relationship between them except as may be required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission if the Company were a registrant under either the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Following the date of this Agreement and regardless of any dispute that may arise in the future, Executive and the Company jointly and mutually agree that they will not disparage, criticize or make statements which are negative, detrimental or injurious to the other to any individual, company or client, including within the Company. 

19\. Withholding. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to withholding, at the time payments are actually made to the Executive and received by him, of such amounts relating to taxes as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, in whole or in part, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accept other provision for payment of taxes as required by law, provided that it is satisfied that all requirements of law as to its responsibilities to withhold such taxes have been satisfied. 

20\. Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy between the Company and the Executive, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach of this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Company and the Executive, unless the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, in which case, the arbitrator will be selected under the procedures of the AAA. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction. However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Executive. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding any choice of law provision included in this Agreement, the United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in Des Moines, Iowa or such other location to which the parties may agree. The Company shall be responsible for the costs of any arbitrator appointed hereunder and the underlying expenses imposed by the American Arbitration Association. 

21\. Successors.

Regardless of whether such an agreement is executed, this Agreement shall be binding upon any successor of the Company in accordance with the operation of law, and such successor shall be deemed the “Company” for purposes of this Agreement. 

(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Company” shall include any successor to the Company’s business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise. 

22\. Attorneys’ Fees.
