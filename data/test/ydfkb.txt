MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Section 1. Place of Meetings. All meetings of stock-holders shall be held at such place or places, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof. 

Section 2. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of other business shall be held on such date and at such place as may be designated by the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect a Board of Directors and may transact such other proper business as may come before the meeting. 

Section 3. Special Meetings. A special meeting of the stockholders, or of any class thereof entitled to vote, for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the President or by order of the Board of Directors and shall be

##### Table of Contents

called by the Secretary upon the written request of stockholders holding of record at least 50% of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting. Such written request shall state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be called. 

Section 4. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given not less than ten days or more than sixty days before the date on which the meeting is to be held to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat by delivering a notice thereof to him personally or by mailing such notice in a postage prepaid envelope directed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, unless he shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices intended for him be directed to another address, in which case such notice shall be directed to him at the address designated in such request. Notice shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall waive such notice in writing, whether prior to or after such meeting, or who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy unless such attendance is for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of such meeting, to the transactions of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Every notice of a special meeting of the stockholders, besides the time and place of the meeting, shall state briefly the objects or purposes thereof. 

Section 5. List of Stockholders. It shall be the duty of the Secretary or other officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of the stock ledger to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in his name. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be kept and produced at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The original or duplicate ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine such list or the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. 

Section 6. Quorum. At each meeting of the stock- holders, the holders of record of a majority of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws. In the absence of a quorum, any officer entitled to preside at, or act as Secretary of, such meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be constituted.

##### Table of Contents

Section 7. Voting. Every stockholder of record who is entitled to vote shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity. At all meetings of the stockholders, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by majority vote of the shares of stock entitled to vote held by stockholders present in person or by proxy, except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Unless demanded by a stockholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by the chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled. 

Section 8. Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy. A proxy acting for any stockholder shall be duly appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of three years from the date thereof unless the proxy provides for a longer period. 

Section 9. Action Without a Meeting. Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stock- holders or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. 

Section 10. Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting. At any annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (A) specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (including stockholder proposals included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to applicable rules and regulations); (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirement, for business (including, but not limited to, any nominations for director) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder: (i) 

3 

* * *

##### Table of Contents

the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and (ii) the subject matter thereof must be a matter which is a proper subject matter for stockholder action at such meeting. To be considered timely notice, a stockholder’s notice must be received by the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation not less than 90 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, if no annual meeting was held in the prior year, or the Board of Directors calls the applicable annual meeting for a date that is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the prior year’s annual meeting, then a stockholder’s notice, in order to be timely, must be received by the Secretary not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day following the day on which the Board of Directors gave notice or made public disclosure, whichever occurred first, of the date of the applicable annual meeting. A stockholder’s notice to the Secretary to submit business to an annual meeting must set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) the name and address of the stockholder; (ii) the number of shares of stock held of record and beneficially by such stockholder; (iii) the name in which all such shares of stock are registered on the stock transfer books of the Corporation; (iv) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons therefor; (v) any personal or other material interest of the stockholder in the business to be submitted; and (vi) all other information relating to the proposed business which may be required to be disclosed under applicable law. In addition, a stockholder seeking to submit such business at an annual meeting shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, a stockholder who seeks to have any proposal included in the Corporation’s proxy materials must provide notice as required by and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The chairman of an annual meeting shall determine all matters relating to the conduct of the meeting, including, but not limited to, determining whether any item of business has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-Laws, and if the chairman should so determine and declare that any item of business has not been properly brought before an annual meeting, then such business shall not be transacted at such meeting.
