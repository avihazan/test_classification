INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITS ON LIABILITY

Paragraph A. The Corporation shall indemnify any Director or Officer made a Party to a Proceeding (including without limitation any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation in which the Director or Officer is adjudged liable to the Corporation) because he or she is or was a 

  
  


* * *

Director or Officer of the Corporation against any Liability incurred in the Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by Virginia law, as it may be amended from time to time.

  


Paragraph B. The Corporation shall not indemnify a Director or Officer under Paragraph A above (unless authorized or ordered by a court) unless in each specific case a determination pursuant to Virginia law, as it may be amended from time to time, has been made that indemnification is permissible under the circumstances. The termination of a Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction is not, of itself, determinative that Director or Officer is not entitled to indemnification under this Article III.

  


Paragraph C. Expenses incurred by a Director or Officer in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding if:

  


1.

The Director or Officer furnishes the Corporation a written statement of his good faith belief that he or she is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article III;

  


2.

The Director or Officer furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet the standard for indemnification pursuant to this Article III; and

  


3.

A determination pursuant to Virginia law, as it may be amended from time to time, is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this Article III.

  


The undertaking required by subsection 2 of this Paragraph C shall be an unlimited general obligation of the Director or Officer but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to his or her financial ability to make repayment.

  


Paragraph D. The indemnification provided by this Article III shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any Director or Officer may be entitled, including without limitation, rights conferred by applicable law and any right under policies of insurance that may be purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others, even as to liabilities against which the Corporation would not have the power to indemnify such Director or Officer under the provisions of this Article III.

  


Paragraph E. The Corporation may purchase and maintain at its sole expense insurance, in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may deem reasonable, against all liabilities or losses it may sustain in consequence of the indemnification provided for in this Article III.

  


Paragraph F. The Board of Directors shall have the power but not the obligation, generally and in specific cases, to indemnify employees and agents of the Corporation to the same extent as provided in this Article III with respect to Directors or Officers. The Board of Directors is hereby empowered by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors to contract in advance to indemnify any Director or Officer. The Board of Directors is further 

  
  


* * *

empowered, by majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors, to cause the Corporation to contract in advance to indemnify any person who is not a Director or Officer who was or is a party to any Proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or was serving at the request of the Corporation as Director, Officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were a Director or Officer.

“Director” means an individual who is or was a director of the Corporation or an individual who, while a director of the Corporation, is or was serving at the Corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise. A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation’s request if his duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes the estate or personal representative of a director.

  


“Officer” means an individual who is or was an officer of the Corporation or an individual who is or was serving at the Corporation’s written request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise. An officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation’s request if his duties to the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Officer” includes the estate or personal representative of an officer. Except as set forth above “Officer” does not include officers of corporations controlled by the Corporation.
