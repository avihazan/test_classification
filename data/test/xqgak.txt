Employee further agrees that, during the Noncompete Period, he shall not acquire or develop any line of business, property or project that is directly competitive with any business engaged in or planned to be engaged in by Employer or any WSI Entity at the time of Employee’s termination, so long as Employee had direct involvement with such business engaged in or planned to be engaged in by Employer or any WSI Entity.

ARTICLE 7: AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT EMPLOYEES   
  
7.01 Employee shall not, during his employment with Employer, or for a period of two (2) years thereafter (“the Nonsolicit Period”) solicit or attempt to solicit any person who is, or during the one (1) year prior to Employee’s termination was, an employee of Employer, for the purpose of employing such persons for any other employer or entity engaged in the Employer’s business (“Employer’s Business”). 

ARTICLE 8: AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

The parties acknowledge that the nonsolicitation articles outlined in this Agreement are agreed to based upon consideration independent from the consideration for the noncompete article, and that the parties intend these nonsolicitation provisions to be separate and independent agreements from the noncompete provision. The parties agree that the nonsolicitation provisions shall remain in force and effect, even if a court of law determines that other provisions of this Agreement are unenforceable, including, but not limited to, the noncompete provision. 

ARTICLE 9: IRREPARABLE HARM   
  
9.01 In the event of any breach or threatened breach of Articles 5, 6, 7, or 8 of this Agreement, Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employer would be irreparably harmed thereby and that remedies at law would be inadequate.

Employee agrees that any ruling that Article 5, 6, 7 or 8 is unenforceable shall not render any other such Article unenforceable.

ARTICLE 12: TOLLING OF RESTRICTIONS

In the event the Employee is unable to pay his share of the costs of arbitration due to financial hardship, the Employee may apply to the AAA for “in forma pauperis” status in accordance with the criteria established by the applicable United States Circuit Court of Appeals. Alternatively, the Employee may apply to the AAA for the use of a pro bona arbitrator or for waiver, reduction or deferral of the AAA’s fees based upon financial hardship. The AAA shall determine whether the employee qualifies for financial hardship or waiver, reduction or deferral of the AAA’s fees and costs. 

13.04 Employer and Employee agree that, in addition to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, the arbitration proceedings will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate federal or state rules of evidence, civil procedure and appellate procedure. 

In cases premised on federal jurisdiction, the Federal Rules of Evidence, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure shall apply. In cases premised on state jurisdiction, the applicable state rules of evidence, civil procedure and appellate procedure shall apply. In cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the federal rules shall apply. The arbitrator shall write an opinion stating all findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the arbitration decision. Employer and Employee agree that the arbitrator’s rulings shall be appealable on the same grounds as a judgment rendered by a court of law (“trial court”). The parties acknowledge that the arbitrator’s decision will be reviewed under the same standard of review used in reviewing a trial court’s decision and will be governed by the applicable rules of appellate procedure referenced hereinabove. 

13.05 The sole exception to this agreement to arbitrate or Employer’s Dispute Resolution Plan involves suits brought on behalf of Employer or Employee seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction (“injunctive relief’) based upon violation of non-compete, and/or confidentiality, and/or non-disclosure, and/or non-disparagement, and/or solicitation agreements, in the event there is immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage. The parties agree that neither shall seek monetary damages under this exception to the agreement to arbitrate. However, in the event that Employer is successful in obtaining injunctive relief as defined herein, Employee shall be liable for payment of Employer’s attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining injunctive relief. 

13.06 This agreement to arbitrate shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor to Employer and such successor shall be deemed substituted for Employer under the terms of this agreement. As used in this agreement to

EXHIBIT 10.21 

arbitrate, the term “successor” shall include any person, firm, limited liability company or other business entity, which at any time, whether by merger, purchase or otherwise, acquires all or substantially all the assets of the business of Employer. This agreement to arbitrate also shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employee, his/her heirs, executors and administrators. 

13.07 If any part, term or provision of this agreement to arbitrate is held to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or to be in conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining provisions or portions of this agreement shall not be affected, and the rights of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if this agreement did not contain the particular term or provision held invalid.
