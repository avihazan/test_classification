DIRECTORS

Section 1. NUMBER AND CLASSES

The business of this Corporation shall be managed and controlled by a Board of Directors consisting of not less than nine (9), nor more than fifteen (15), the number of which shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and notice thereof given the stockholders at least fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting at which the election is to be held. The Board of Directors shall be divided into classes to be designated Class A, Class B and Class C, respectively. After the first election by classes, each class shall be elected for a term of three years. Only the class whose term expired in the year of election shall be elected at the stockholders meeting of that year unless the Board shall otherwise provide. If the Board of Directors fails to fix the number of directors which shall comprise the Board of Directors for the ensuing year or fails to give the notice herein prescribed to the stockholders, then the number of directors of the class to be elected at the annual meeting shall be the same as the number elected at the last prior election of such class, subject to change by the Board in the event minority nominations are made.

Section 2. PROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION

The holder or holders, jointly or severally, of not less than one-fifth but less than a majority of the shares of the common Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to nominate directors for election at the annual stockholders’ meeting. In the event such nomination is made, the number of directors which the minority stockholders shall be entitled to elect shall be that proportion of the total number of directors (to the extent such number is divisible) which the number of shares held by the persons making such nomination bears to the whole number of shares issued; provided, the holder or holders of the minority shares of stock shall not be entitled to elect more than one-fifth (disregarding fractions) of the total number of directors to be elected for each one-fifth of the entire capital stock of such Corporation so held by them; and provided further that this section shall not be construed to prevent holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation from electing the majority of the directors. If the term of any director previously elected by minority stockholders does not expire at the time of an election, the number of directors which the minority would otherwise be entitled to nominate at such election shall be reduced by the number of majority directors whose terms do not expire.

If, at any meeting of stockholders at which members of the Board of Directors are to be elected, minority shareholders hold the number of shares requisite under the Articles and Bylaws to make nominations, the meeting shall be recessed to enable the Board to change the previously fixed number of directors to be elected at the meeting, if the Board deems such a change necessary to accommodate the right of majority and minority representation on the Board.

No stockholder who has voted with the majority for the election of directors at such meeting or who has given an unrevoked proxy pursuant to a solicitation by management, which has obtained a majority of stockholder proxies, shall be regarded as a minority stockholder for purposes of such election and no stockholder who has been recognized as a minority stockholder for the purpose of one minority nomination shall be recognized for purpose of another nomination at the same election.
