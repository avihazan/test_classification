employment shall have been terminated by the Employer for Cause, then, to the extent required by applicable law, the Employer shall have no obligation whatsoever to indemnify the Executive for any claim arising out of the matter for which his employment shall have been terminated for Cause or for any conduct of the Executive not within the scope of the Executive’s duties under this Agreement. 

6\. Confidential Information.

Upon termination of this Agreement, and upon the request of the Employer, the Executive shall promptly deliver to the Employer any and all written materials, records and documents, including all copies thereof, made by the Executive or coming into his possession during the Term and retained by the Executive containing or concerning confidential information of the Employer and all other written materials furnished to and retained by the Executive by the Employer for his use during the Term, including all copies thereof, whether of a confidential nature or otherwise. 

7\. Representation and Warranty of the Executive. The Executive represents and warrants that he is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any other firm or corporation, that would prevent his entry into the employ of the Employer or his performance of the terms of this Agreement. 

8\. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement and the Restricted Stock Award Agreement contain the entire agreement between the Employer and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended, waived, changed, modified or discharged except by an instrument in writing executed by the Employer and the Executive.

10\. Notice. Any notice that may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and be deemed given when hand delivered and acknowledged or, if mailed, one day after mailing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or if delivered by an overnight delivery service, one day after the notice is delivered to such service, to either the Employer or the Executive at their respective addresses stated above, or at such other address as the Executive or the Employer may by similar notice designate. 

11\. Specific Performance. The Employer and the Executive agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of paragraph 6 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

12\. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity other than the parties (and the Executive’s heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives and the permitted transferees of the Shares) any rights or remedies of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement. 

13\. Successor Liability. The Employer shall require any successor, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Employer to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. 

14\. Mitigation. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits payable after the termination of this Agreement, except that the Employer shall not be required to provide the Executive and his eligible dependents with medical insurance coverage as long as the Executive and his eligible dependents are receiving comparable medical insurance coverage from another employer. 

15\. Waiver of Breach. The failure at any time to enforce or exercise any right under any of the provisions of this Agreement or to require at any time performance by the other parties of any of the provisions hereof shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provisions or to affect either the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof, or the right of any party hereafter to enforce or exercise its rights under each and every provision in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

16\. No Attachment. Except as required by law, no right to receive payments under this Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, commutation, alienation, sale, assignment, 

-9-

##### 

encumbrance, charge, pledge or hypothecation or to execution, attachment, levy or similar process or assignment by operation of law, and any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any such action shall be null, void and of no effect; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 17 shall preclude the assumption of such rights by executors, administrators or other legal representatives of the Executive or his estate and their assigning any rights under this Agreement to the person or persons entitled hereto. 

17\. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term, phrase, clause, paragraph, restriction, covenant, agreement or other provision hereof shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, or any part thereof, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable term, phrase, clause, paragraph, restriction, covenant, agreement or other provision had never been contained in this Agreement unless the deletion of such term, phrase, clause, paragraph, restriction, covenant, agreement or other provision would result in such a material change as to cause the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be unreasonable or would materially and adversely frustrate the objectives of the Employer and the Executive as expressed in this Agreement. 

18\. Survival of Benefits. Any provision of this Agreement that provides a benefit to the Executive and that by the express terms hereof does not terminate upon the expiration of the Term shall survive the expiration of the Term and shall remain binding upon the Employer until such time as such benefits are paid in full to the Executive or his estate. 

19\. Construction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. All headings in this Agreement have been inserted solely for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.
