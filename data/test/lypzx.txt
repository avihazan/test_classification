3.3.1 The Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and to purchase the shares being sold to it hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Purchaser and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action, and no further consent or authorization of such Purchaser is required. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Purchaser and constitutes, or shall constitute when executed and delivered, a valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser enforceable against such Purchaser in accordance with the terms thereof.

  


3.3.2 The Purchaser is, and will be at the time of the execution of this Agreement, an “accredited investor”, as such term is defined in Regulation D promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), is experienced in investments and business matters, has made investments of a speculative nature and has purchased securities of United States publicly-owned companies in the past and, with its representatives, has such knowledge and experience in financial, tax and other business matters as to enable such Purchaser to utilize the information made available by the Company to evaluate the merits and risks of and to make an informed investment decision with respect to the proposed purchase, which represents a speculative investment. The Purchaser has the authority and is duly and legally qualified to purchase and own shares of the Company. The Purchaser is able to bear the risk of such investment for an indefinite period and to afford a complete loss thereof. The information set forth on the signature page hereto regarding the Purchaser is accurate.

3.3.4 The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Acquired Shares have not been registered under the 1933 Act or any applicable state securities laws, by reason of their issuance in a transaction that does not require registration under the 1933 Act (based in part on the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained herein), and that such Acquired Shares must be held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition is registered under the 1933 Act or any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from such registration. In any event, and subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Purchaser may enter into lawful hedging transactions in the course of hedging the position they assume and the Purchaser may also enter into lawful short positions or other derivative transactions relating to the Acquired Shares, or interests in the Acquired Shares, and deliver the Acquired Shares, or interests in the Acquired Shares, to close out their short or other positions or otherwise settle other transactions, or loan or pledge the Acquired Shares, or interests in the Acquired Shares, to third parties who in turn may dispose of these Acquired Shares.

  


3.3.5 The Acquired Shares shall bear the following or similar legend:

  


“THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, NOR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.”
