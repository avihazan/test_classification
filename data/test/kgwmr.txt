WHEREAS, Buyer was organized for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination, an operating business (“Business Combination”); and 

WHEREAS, Buyer consummated an initial public offering in October, 2007 (“IPO”) in connection with which it raised net proceeds of approximately $529.1 million, a significant portion of which was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (“Trustee”) pending the consummation of a Business Combination, or the dissolution and liquidation of Buyer in the event it is unable to consummate a Business Combination on or prior to September 28, 2009 (or October 5, 2009 in the event that the Acquisition is approved by Buyer stockholders); and 

WHEREAS, Buyer has entered into that certain Purchase and IPO Reorganization Agreement dated as of August 2, 2009, by and among HACI, Resolute Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “REC”), Resolute Subsidiary Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Resolute Aneth, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Resolute Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Resolute Holdings Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Holdings Sub”), and HH-HACI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which, through a series of transactions, HACI stockholders will acquire a majority of the outstanding common stock of REC, par value $0.0001 per share (the “REC Common Stock”), and REC will acquire HACI and the business and operations of Holdings Sub (collectively, the “Acquisition”); and 

WHEREAS, the approval of the Acquisition is contingent upon, among other things, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares of HACI at the special meeting called to approve the Acquisition; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to certain provisions in Buyer’s certificate of incorporation, a holder of shares of Buyer’s common stock issued in the IPO may, if it votes against the Acquisition, demand that Buyer convert such common shares into cash (“Conversion Rights”); and 

WHEREAS, the Acquisition cannot be consummated if holders of 30% or more of HACI common stock issued in the IPO exercise their Conversion Rights; and 

WHEREAS, Seller has agreed to sell to Buyer and Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller the common shares set forth on the execution page of this Agreement (“Shares”) for the purchase price per share set forth therein (“Purchase Price Per Share”) and for the aggregate purchase price set forth therein (“Aggregate Purchase Price”). 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

1

* * *

##### 

1\. Purchase. Subject to Section 8, Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase from Seller at the Closing (as defined in Section 4(c)) the Shares at the Purchase Price Per Share, for the Aggregate Purchase Price. 

2\. Agreement not to Convert; Appointment of Proxy and Attorney-in-Fact. In further consideration of the Aggregate Purchase Price, provided that the representations and warranties made by Buyer in Section 6 hereof are true and correct in all material respects on the date of the stockholder meeting in connection with the approval of the Acquisition with the same effect as though made on such date and Buyer has complied in all material respects with its obligations set forth in this Agreement through such date, Seller hereby agrees it has not and will not exercise its Conversion Rights or, if it has already exercised its Conversion Rights, it hereby withdraws and revokes such exercise and will execute all necessary documents and take all actions required in furtherance of such revocation. Seller acknowledges that the record date to vote on the proposals set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus (the “Proxy Statement”) filed by Buyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has passed. Accordingly, solely with respect to the vote for the Acquisition and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement, Seller hereby agrees to upon request of Buyer vote in favor of the Acquisition and such other proposals and appoints Joseph B. Armes and Robert M. Swartz and each of them each with full power of substitution, as his proxy and attorney-in-fact, to the full extent of Seller’s rights with respect to the Shares (and any and all other shares or securities or rights issued or issuable in respect thereof) to vote in such manner as each such person or his substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper, and to otherwise act (including without limitation acting by written consent) with respect to all the Shares at any meeting of stockholders (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned meeting) of Buyer held on or prior to September 28, 2009. This proxy is coupled with an interest in the Shares and is irrevocable. Execution by Seller of this Agreement shall revoke, without further action, all prior proxies granted by Seller at any time with respect to the Shares (and such other shares or other securities), and no subsequent proxies will be given by Seller (and if given will be deemed not to be effective), provided that the representations and warranties made by Buyer in Section 6 hereof are true and correct in all material respects on the date of the stockholder meeting in connection with the approval of the Acquisition with the same effect as though made on such date and Buyer has complied in all material respects with its obligations set forth in this Agreement through such date. This section 2 shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

3\. No Right to Additional Shares. HACI’s stockholders of record are entitled to receive one share of REC Common Stock for each share of HACI common stock owned immediately prior to the consummation of the Acquisition (the “Exchange”). Although Seller will be a stockholder of record immediately prior to the Acquisition, Seller hereby acknowledges that Seller irrevocably waives any right, title or interest it may have in receiving any such REC Common Stock distributed pursuant to the Exchange. Seller hereby acknowledges that by virtue of the sale hereunder, Seller will not become a stockholder of REC, and the Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent only the right to receive the Aggregate Purchase Price therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Buyer and Seller hereby agree and acknowledge that this provision is material to this Agreement and a significant consideration in Buyer’s willingness to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such waiver shall not be effective in the event that Seller does not receive the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

4\. Closing Matters. 

(a) Within one business day of the date of this Agreement, (i) Seller shall provide Buyer with a true and correct copy of the voting instruction form with respect to the Shares held by Seller indicating the financial institution through which such shares are held and the control number provided by Broadridge Financial Solutions (or other similar service provider) regarding the voting of the 

2

* * *

##### 

Shares or written confirmation of such information as would appear on the voting instruction form; and (ii) Buyer shall send the notice attached as Annex I hereto to Trustee. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer appropriate instructions for book entry transfers of ownership of the Shares from Seller to Buyer. 

(c) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (“Closing”) will occur on the date on which Buyer’s Trust Account is liquidated in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, which shall occur no later than 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 28, 2009 (or 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 30, 2009 in the event that the Acquisition is approved by Buyer stockholders) (the “Closing Date”). At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the Aggregate Purchase Price by wire transfer from HACI’s Trust Account of immediately available funds in accordance with the Irrevocable Instructions attached as Annex I hereto to an account specified by Seller and Seller against delivery of the Shares shall deliver the Shares to Buyer electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System to an account specified by Buyer. It shall be a condition to the obligation of Buyer on the one hand and Seller on the other hand, to consummate the transfer of the Shares contemplated hereunder that the other party’s representations and warranties are true and correct on the Closing Date with the same effect as though made on such date, unless waived in writing by the party to whom such representations and warranties are made. 

(d) In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated by 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 28, 2009 (or 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 30, 2009 in the event that the Acquisition is approved by Buyer stockholders) and Buyer has not dissolved and liquidated its assets by September 30, 2009, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds, until Buyer liquidates and distributes its assets to its stockholders, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 4.0% of the Purchase Price Per Share per month (pro-rated on a daily basis based on the date when payment is required and the date such payment is made) or (ii) the highest lawful rate, for each Share held by Seller from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment is actually made. Buyer agrees to promptly dissolve and liquidate and distribute its assets in accordance with Delaware law if the Acquisition is not consummated by 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 28, 2009 (or 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on September 30, 2009 in the event that the Acquisition is approved by Buyer stockholders). 

(e) In the event that the Acquisition is consummated and Seller has not received the Aggregate Purchase Price by September 30, 2009, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 4.0% of the Purchase Price Per Share per month (pro-rated on a daily basis based on the date when payment is required and the date such payment is made) or (ii) the highest lawful rate, for each Share held by Seller from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment is actually made. 

5\. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. Seller makes the following representations and warranties to and for the benefit of Buyer on the date hereof and on the Closing. 

(a) Sophisticated Seller. Seller is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to evaluate the risks and benefits attendant to the sale of Shares to Buyer. 

(b) Independent Investigation. Seller, in making the decision to sell the Shares to Buyer, has not relied upon any oral or written representations or assurances from Buyer or any of its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives or agents of Buyer, except as are contained in this Agreement. Seller has had access to all of the filings made by HACI with the SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the Securities Act of 1933, as

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Seller does not and will not conflict with, violate or cause a breach of, constitute a default under, or result in a violation of (i) any agreement, contract or instrument to which Seller is a party which would prevent Seller from performing its obligations hereunder or (ii) any law, statute, rule or regulation to which Seller is subject. 

(d) No Legal Advice from Buyer. Seller acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with Seller’s own legal counsel and investment and tax advisors. Seller is not relying on any statements or representations of Buyer or any of its representatives or agents for legal, tax or investment advice with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

Seller has the sole right to exercise Conversion Rights with respect to the Shares. 

(f) Number of Shares. The Shares being transferred pursuant to this Agreement represent all the common stock owned by Seller as of the date hereof.

Each of the parties hereby agrees that any action, proceeding or claim against it arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive.

13\. Remedies. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by the other party, money damages may be inadequate with respect to any such breach and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law.

17\. Maximum Payments. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of a rate of interest or other charges in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In the event that the rate of interest required to be paid or other charges hereunder exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, any payments in excess of such maximum rate shall be credited against amounts owed by Buyer to Seller and thus refunded to Buyer, as applicable.
