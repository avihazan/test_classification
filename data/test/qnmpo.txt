  




  


Stock Purchase Agreement, made this 7th day of November, 2007, between GCA III Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, with its principal offices located at 115 East 57th Street, New York, NY 10022 (the “Company”), and the undersigned (the “Purchaser”).

  


WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue to Purchaser 5,000,000 shares (the “Shares”) of the common stock of the Company, par value $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the Purchaser desires to acquire the Shares;

  


NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties do hereby agree as follows:

  


1.Subscription/Purchase of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Purchaser hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company the Shares, at a price in cash equal to $0.02 per share, and the Company agrees to sell and issue the Shares to the Purchaser for such purchase price. The certificates for the Shares will be delivered by the Company within a reasonable period following acceptance of this Stock Purchase Agreement by the Company. If this subscription is rejected for any reason by the Company, the Purchaser will be promptly notified. 

  


2.Acknowledgements, Representations and Covenants of Purchaser.

  


2.1 The Purchaser recognizes that the purchase of the Shares involves a high degree of risk in that (i) the Company is highly speculative; (ii) it may not be able to liquidate his investment; and (iii) transferability of the Shares is extremely limited. The Purchaser acknowledges, moreover, that it’s managing representatives have read and fully understand the Company’s most recent annual and quarterly filings on Forms 10-KSB and 10-QSB, respectively.

  


2.2 The Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) by reason of a claimed exemption under the provisions of the Securities Act which depends, in part, upon its investment intention. In this connection, the Purchaser understands that it is the position of the SEC that the statutory basis for such exemption would not be present if its representation merely meant that its present intention was to hold such securities for a short period, such as the capital gains period under any tax statutes, for a deferred sale, for a market rise, assuming that a market is maintained, or for any other fixed period. The Purchaser realizes that, in the view of the SEC, a purchase now with an intent to resell would represent a purchase with an intent inconsistent with his representation to the Company, and the SEC might regard such a sale or disposition as a deferred sale to which such exemptions are not available.

  


2.3 The Purchaser acknowledges that this private placement of securities has not been reviewed by the SEC because of the Company’s representations that it is intended to be a non-public offering made pursuant to exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including those under Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state, that the Shares are being purchased for investment purposes and not with a view to distribution or resale, nor with the intention of selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of all or any part of the Shares for any particular price, or at any particular time, or upon the happening of any particular event or circumstances, except selling, transferring or disposing of said Shares in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder or in connection therewith, and applicable state securities laws. The Purchaser further acknowledges that the Shares must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from such registration is available, and an opinion of counsel is furnished stating that registration is not required under the Securities Act or such state securities laws.

2.4 The Purchaser understands that there is currently no market, public or non-public, for the Shares. The Purchaser understands that the Shares are prohibited from being sold pursuant to the exemptions provided by section 4(1) of the Securities Act or Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act in accordance with the letter from Richard K. Wulff, Chief of the Office of Small Business Policy of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision’s Division of Corporation Finance to Ken Worm of NASD Regulation, Inc., dated January 21, 2000. The Purchaser understands and hereby acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to register the Shares under the Securities Act or any in any state. The Purchaser consents that the Company may, if it determines appropriate in its discretion, permit the transfer of any of the Shares out of its name only when a request for transfer is accompanied by an opinion of counsel to the Company that neither the sale nor the proposed transfer results in a violation of the Securities Act or of the applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. 

  


2.5 The Purchaser acknowledges that the certificates to be issued representing the Shares may bear a legend containing the following or similar words:

  


“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”) OR ANY OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTRIBUTION OR RESALE, AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, OR OFFERED FOR TRANSFER, SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT, AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, OR THE AVAILABILITY OF AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS. 

  


THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE FURTHER PROHIBITED FROM BEING SOLD PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED BY SECTION 4(1) OF THE ACT OR RULE 144 THEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LETTER FROM RICHARD K. WULFF, CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS POLICY OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISION’S DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE TO KEN WORM OF NASD REGULATION, INC., DATED JANUARY 21, 2000.”

  


2.6 The Purchaser hereby represents that it is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D Rule 501 (a) under the Securities Act insofar as it is an entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors, and that it has submitted to the Company investor questionnaires for each of such equity owners together, and in connection, herewith. 

  


2.7 The Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its officers, directors, agents and attorneys against any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal or other expenses as such are incurred) incurred by each such person in connection with defending or investigating any claims or liabilities, whether or not resulting in any liability to such person to which any such indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act, under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses (a) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in this Stock Purchase Agreement, or (b) arise out of or are based upon any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement contained herein.
