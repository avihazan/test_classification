(d) TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR DEATH, DISABILITY OR CAUSE.

If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in Sections 5 through 10 hereof is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state. 

13. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify and hold Employee harmless for acts and omissions in Employee's capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and the Company's charter documents; provided, however, that neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall indemnify Employee for any losses incurred by Employee as a result of acts described in Section 4(c) of this Agreement.
