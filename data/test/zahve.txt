Provisions

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual benefits hereinafter provided, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties, the Company and the Participant, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1\. 

Restricted Stock Award. The Company hereby grants to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth or incorporated herein, an Award consisting of a total of [_] shares of Class A Common and [_] shares of Class L Common, subject to adjustment under the Plan (the “Shares”). For the purposes hereof, each Nine (9) shares of Class A Common Stock and One (1) share of Class L Common Stock shall constitute a “Unit.” Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will, subject to Section 6 below, issue to the Participant the Shares granted hereunder, and such Shares shall constitute Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan.  
  
2\. 

Effect of the Plan. The Award granted under this Agreement is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which are incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. The Participant will abide by, and the Award granted to the Participant will be subject to, all of the provisions of the Plan and of this Agreement, together with all rules and determinations from time to time issued by the Committee established to administer the Plan.  
  
3\. 

Restriction Period. The restriction period applicable to the Award granted hereunder is as follows:  
  
(a) 

All Shares shall be unvested at issuance. Subject to Section 3(b) below, (i) 50% of the Shares shall vest on the second anniversary date of this Agreement (or the following business day if such date is not a business day) if the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company on such date and (ii) 50% of the Shares shall vest on the third anniversary date of this Agreement (or the following business day if such date is not a business day) if the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company on such date; provided, that 100% of the Shares shall vest if Participant’s employment is earlier terminated as a result of the Participant’s death or Disability.  
  
* * *

(b) 

All unvested Shares shall automatically be forfeited (and shall not vest) if the Participant’s employment with the Company shall terminate for any reason prior to the date on which they otherwise would have vested pursuant to Section 3(a) above.  
  
(c) 

All vested Shares shall be subject to the call options described in Section 5 of the Stockholders Agreement.  
  
(d) 

Participant shall be entitled to receipt of all dividends paid by the Company on its Shares, as and when such dividends are declared and paid to holders of Shares; provided, any dividends on unvested Shares shall be held and paid to Participant within 10 days after the vesting of such Shares after becoming vested.  
  
4\. 

Stockholders Agreement. As a condition to the issuance of any Shares hereunder, Participant shall agree in writing (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to become a party to, and be bound by, the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.  
  
5\. 

Withholding Taxes. The Administrator may make such provision for any applicable federal or state the withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 6(a)(4) of the Plan. In addition, at least sixty (60) days prior to the time of vesting of any Units granted under this Agreement, the Company will give notice thereof to the Participant. Participant shall deliver to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy all United States federal, state and local and non-United States tax of any kind (including Participant’s FICA and SDI obligations) which the Board, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to be withheld or remitted with respect to the Units in order to comply with the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and/or any other applicable law, rule or regulation (the “Minimum Withholding Tax”). Alternatively, at the Participant’s election, exercisable on or before ten (10) days prior to the date of vesting of such Units, the Company shall have the power and right to deduct or withhold a number of Units having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of vesting thereof) equal to the Minimum Withholding Tax plus any additional tax due with respect to the Units becoming vested (up to a maximum forty percent aggregate tax); provided, however, that such option shall be deemed to have been exercised in the case of accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 3(a) in the case of Participant’s death or Disability. Participant shall remain responsible for the payment of any remaining taxes payable on account of the vesting of Units.  
  
6\. 

Delivery of Stock. Certificates representing Shares granted pursuant to this Agreement will be held in escrow by the Company on the Participant’s behalf during any period of restriction thereon and will bear an appropriate legend specifying the applicable restrictions thereon. Whenever Shares subject to the Award are released from restriction, the Company shall issue a certificate to Participant for such unrestricted Shares. The Company shall follow all requisite procedures to deliver such certificate to Participant; provided, however, that such delivery may be postponed to enable the Company to comply with applicable procedures, regulations or listing requirements of any governmental agency, stock exchange or regulatory agency.  
  
7\. 

Transferability of Award. This Award may only be transferred by will, and by the laws of descent and distribution (and in connection therewith, such transferees must agree in writing (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to become a party to, and be bound by, the Stockholders Agreement). The terms of this Award, including the restriction and vesting provisions set forth in Section 3, shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the Participant.  
  
8\. 

Adjustment Upon Changes in Shares. In the event of a change in the Company’s capital structure, the adjustments provided for in Section 7(b) of the Plan shall be made to the number of Shares subject to the Award hereunder.
