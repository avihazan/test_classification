Exhibit 10.1



This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is entered into, by and between MeetMe, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Jonah Harris (“Executive”) as of October 5, 2015 (the “Effective Date”).

WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement to reflect Executive’s position and role in the Company’s business and to provide for Executive’s employment by the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

WHEREAS, Executive has agreed to certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained hereunder, in consideration of the benefits provided to Executive under this Agreement.

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms shall have the meanings given those terms in Section 3 of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1\. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive, and Executive hereby accepts such employment and agrees to perform Executive’s duties and responsibilities, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth. 

1.1 Employment Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date, and shall continue until first anniversary of the Effective Date, unless the Agreement is terminated sooner in accordance with Section 2 below. In addition, the term of the Agreement shall automatically renew for periods of one year unless the Company gives written notice to Executive, at least 60 days prior to the end of the initial term or at least 60 days prior to the end of any one-year renewal period, that the Agreement shall be terminated. The period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date on which the term of Executive’s employment under the Agreement shall terminate is hereinafter referred to as the “Employment Term.” The Company’s termination of this Agreement upon the first anniversary of the Effective Date or at the end of any one-year renewal period shall be considered an involuntary termination of Executive’s employment under this Agreement if (i) Executive is willing and able to continue performing services under terms similar to those in this Agreement, (ii) the Company does not offer Executive continued employment on terms substantially similar to those in this Agreement, and (iii) Executive’s employment terminates other than for Cause (as defined in Section 3), death, Disability (as defined in Section 3) or resignation by Executive without Good Reason (as defined in Section 3) at the date of such termination of the Agreement.

1.2 Duties and Responsibilities; Principal Place of Employment. During the Employment Term, Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “CEO”) and shall serve as the Chief Technology Officer of the Company, or in such other positions as the CEO or the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) determines. Executive’s principal place of employment under this Agreement will be the Company’s headquarters in New Hope, PA; provided that Executive may be required to travel for business in accordance with his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement. 

1.3 Extent of Service. During the Employment Term, Executive agrees to use Executive’s full and best efforts to carry out Executive’s duties and responsibilities as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof with the highest degree of loyalty and the highest standards of care and, consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement, Executive agrees to devote substantially all of Executive’s business time, attention and energy thereto. The foregoing shall not be construed as preventing Executive from making investments in other businesses or enterprises, provided that Executive agrees not to become engaged in any other business activity which, in the reasonable judgment of the CEO, is likely to interfere with Executive’s ability to discharge Executive’s duties and responsibilities to the Company or which conflict with Executive’s obligations pursuant to the Section 5 hereof. Executive will not serve on the board of directors of an entity unrelated to the Company (other than non-profit charitable organizations) without the consent of the CEO and consistent with the Company’s written code of business conduct and ethics, including the MeetMe, Inc. Code of Conduct and Ethics.

1.4 Base Salary. During the Employment Term, for all the services rendered by Executive hereunder, the Company shall pay Executive a base salary (“Base Salary”), at the annual rate of $257,930, payable in installments at such times as the Company customarily pays its other employees. Executive’s Base Salary shall be reviewed periodically for appropriate adjustments, if any, by the CEO or the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) pursuant to the Company’s normal performance review policies for senior level executives. Executive’s Base Salary also may be decreased as part of an overall Company reduction of compensation.

1.5 Retirement, Welfare and Other Benefit Plans and Programs. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be entitled to participate in the employee retirement and welfare benefit plans and programs made available to the Company’s senior level executives as a group, as such retirement and welfare plans may be in effect from time to time and subject to the eligibility requirements of such plans. Currently, the Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan and provides medical, dental, vision and life insurance to its senior level executives. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be entitled to no less than 15 days of vacation and sick leave in accordance with the Company’s vacation, holiday and other pay for time not worked policies. Nothing in this Agreement or otherwise shall prevent the Company from amending or terminating any retirement, welfare or other employee benefit plans, programs, policies or perquisites from time to time as the Company deems appropriate. 

1.6 Reimbursement of Expenses. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be provided with reimbursement of reasonable expenses related to Executive’s employment by the Company on a basis no less favorable than that which may be authorized from time to time for the Company’s senior level executives as a group. 

1.7 Incentive Compensation. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be entitled to participate in all short-term and long-term incentive programs established by the Company, at such levels as the CEO or Compensation Committee determines. Executive shall be eligible for annual incentive compensation with a target amount equal to 30% of his Base Salary. The actual amount of such annual incentive compensation shall be determined in accordance with the applicable plans based on achievement of individual and Company performance objectives established in advance by the CEO or Compensation Committee. No minimum incentive is guaranteed. 

1.8 Equity Compensation. As additional consideration for the terms and conditions of this Agreement, effective on the Effective Date, Executive will receive a stock option to purchase 75,000 shares of Company common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s equity compensation plan and Executive’s execution of a stock option grant agreement (the “Option”). The exercise price of the Option will be the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Effective Date. The Option will vest as to one-third of the shares subject to the Option on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining two-thirds of the shares subject to the Option will vest in substantially equal installments on a monthly basis over the following two years, subject to Executive’s continued employment on the applicable vesting date. Additionally, effective on the Effective Date, Executive will receive a restricted stock award of 100,000 shares of Company common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s equity compensation plan and Employee’s execution of a restricted stock award grant agreement (the “Restricted Stock Award”). The Restricted Stock Award will vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to Executive’s continued employment on the applicable vesting date.

2\. Termination. Executive’s employment shall terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

2.1 Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason. The Company may terminate Executive’s employment with the Company at any time without Cause, in which case the Employment Term shall be deemed to have ended, effective upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice to Executive pursuant to Section 4 (or upon another mutually agreed upon date). Additionally, Executive may resign from his employment with the Company for Good Reason, in which case the Employment Term shall be deemed to have ended, with such resignation to become effective no later than the day immediately following the 90th day following the initial occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure by the Company to renew this Agreement (for a reason other than Cause, death or Disability or Executive’s resignation without Good Reason) shall be treated as termination of Executive’s employment under this Section 2.1. 

2.2 Benefits Payable upon Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason.

(a) In the event of a termination of Executive’s employment as described in Section 2.1 during the Employment Term (including, termination as a result of the Company’s decision not to renew this Agreement for a reason other than Cause, death or Disability or Executive’s resignation without Good Reason), if Executive executes and does not revoke a Release (as defined in Section 3), then for the 12 month period following the Termination Date (as defined in Section 3), Executive shall receive an amount equal to Executive’s periodic Base Salary payments (at the rate in effect immediately before the Termination Date), which shall be paid in periodic installments in accordance with the Company’s payroll practices. Subject to Executive’s delivery and non-revocation of an effective Release, payments will begin on the first regularly scheduled payroll date that occurs after the 60th day after the Termination Date, and the first payment will include amounts not yet paid during the 60 day period. 

(b) In addition to the foregoing, Executive shall receive any other amounts earned, accrued or owing but not yet paid under Section 1 above and any other benefits in accordance with the terms of any applicable plans and programs of the Company; provided that Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance benefits under any Company severance plan.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive is a “specified employee” of a publicly held corporation on the Termination Date, the postponement provisions of Section 409A of the Code, as described in Section 20 below, shall apply, if applicable.

2.3 Retirement or Other Voluntary Termination. Executive may voluntarily terminate employment for any reason, including voluntary retirement, effective upon 30 days’ prior written notice of termination in accordance with Section 4. In such event, after the effective date of such termination, no further payments shall be due under this Agreement. However, Executive shall receive any amounts earned, accrued or owing but not yet paid under Section 1 above through the Termination Date and shall be entitled to any benefits due in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.3 shall not apply if Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (in which case Section 2.2 shall apply). 

3

* * *

2.4 Disability. The Company may terminate Executive’s employment if Executive incurs a Disability upon written notice of termination in accordance with Section 4. Executive agrees, in the event of a dispute relating to Executive’s Disability, to submit to a physical examination by a licensed physician selected by the Company. If Executive’s employment terminates on account of Disability, no further payments shall be due under this Agreement. However, Executive shall be entitled to (i) any benefits accrued or earned under the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company, (ii) any amounts earned, accrued or owing but not yet paid under Section 1 above through the Termination Date and (iii) a pro rated bonus for the year in which Executive’s Disability occurs.

2.5 Death. If Executive dies while employed by the Company, the Company shall pay to Executive’s executor, legal representative, administrator or designated beneficiary, as applicable, (i) any amounts earned, accrued or owing but not yet paid under Section 1 above through the Termination Date, (ii) any benefits accrued or earned under the Company’s benefit plans and programs according to the terms of such plans, and (iii) a pro rated bonus for the year in which Executive’s death occurs. Otherwise, the Company shall have no further liability or obligation under this Agreement to Executive’s executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns.

2.6 Cause. The Company or the CEO may terminate Executive’s employment at any time for Cause upon written notice or termination to Executive in accordance with Section 4, in which event all payments under this Agreement shall cease, except for Base Salary to the extent already accrued. Executive shall be entitled to any benefits accrued or earned before Executive’s termination in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company; provided that Executive shall not be entitled to receive any unpaid short-term or long-term cash incentive payments and Executive shall forfeit any outstanding equity grants in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant agreements. 

3\. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified in this Section 3:

(a) “Cause” shall mean any of the following grounds for termination of Executive’s employment: 

(i) Executive’s commission of a felony (excluding all vehicular and traffic offenses);

(ii) Executive neglects, refuses, or fails to perform Executive’s duties to the Company (other than a failure resulting from Executive’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

(iii) Executive commits an act of dishonesty or breach of trust or otherwise engages in misconduct in the performance of Executive’s duties;

(iv) Executive engages in public conduct that is harmful to the reputation of the Company;

(vi) Executive breaches the Company’s written code of business conduct and ethics, including the MeetMe, Inc. Code of Conduct and Ethics. 

Prior to any termination for Cause pursuant to each such event listed in (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) above, to the extent such event(s) is capable of being cured by Executive, the Company shall give Executive written notice thereof describing in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Cause and Executive shall have the opportunity to remedy same within 30 days after receiving written notice.

(b) “Code” shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Termination of Executive’s employment by the Company for Cause, by Executive other than for resignation for Good Reason or as a result of Executive’s death or Disability shall not be deemed to constitute or result in resignation for Good Reason.

The notice of termination shall (i) indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) briefly summarize the facts and circumstances deemed to provide a basis for a termination of employment if for Cause or resignation for Good Reason, and (iii) specify the Termination Date in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement.

5.3 Equitable Relief; Survival.

(a) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Section 5 are reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the legitimate interests, properties, goodwill and business of the Company, that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such restrictions and that irreparable injury will be suffered by the Company should Executive breach any of the provisions of this Section.

In the event that any of the provisions of this Section 5 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, service, or other limitations permitted by applicable law in any jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the provision shall be amended to the extent of the maximum time, geographic, service, or other limitations permitted by applicable law, that such amendment shall apply only within the jurisdiction of the court that made such adjudication and that the provision otherwise be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive breaches any of Executive’s obligations under this Section 5, the Company shall thereafter be obligated only for the compensation and other benefits provided in any Company benefit plans, policies or practices then applicable to Executive in accordance with the terms thereof, and all payments under Section 2 of this Agreement shall cease and the Company may require that Executive repay all amounts theretofore paid to him pursuant to Section 2 and in such case Executive shall promptly repay such amounts. 

(d) Executive irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that any suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of Section 5, including without limitation, any action commenced by the Company for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief, shall be brought solely in a United States District Court for Pennsylvania, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, (ii) consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding, and (iii) waives any objection which Executive may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court. Executive also irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of any process, pleadings, notices or other papers in a manner permitted by the notice provisions of Section 9 hereof.

(e) The provisions of this Sections 5 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

6\. Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Resignation from Boards; Clawback.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive’s continuing or future participation in or rights under any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the Company and for which Executive may qualify; provided, however, that if Executive becomes entitled to and receives the payments described in Section 2.2(a) of this Agreement, Executive hereby waives Executive’s right to receive payments under any severance plan or similar program applicable to employees of the Company.

(b) If Executive’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason, Executive shall immediately resign from all boards of directors of the Company, any affiliates and any other entities for which Executive serves as a representative of the Company.

(c) Executive agrees that Executive will be subject to any compensation clawback, recoupment and anti-hedging policies that may be applicable to Executive as an executive of the Company, as in effect from time to time and as approved by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof.

7\. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement (including without limitation Section 5) shall survive any termination of Executive’s employment or termination of this Agreement to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations.

8\. Mitigation. Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and there shall be no offset against amounts due Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that Executive may obtain.

The Company shall also provide Executive with coverage as a named insured under a directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained for the Company’s directors and officers. This obligation to provide insurance and indemnify Executive shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to proceedings or threatened proceedings based on acts or omissions of Executive occurring during Executive’s employment with the Company or with any of its affiliates. Such obligations shall be binding upon the Company’s successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Executive’s heirs and personal representatives.

15\. Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver.

20\. Section 409A of the Code. 

(a) This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations, to the extent applicable.

22\. Waiver of Jury Trial. AS SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED FOR INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT (AFTER HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL), EACH PARTY HERETO EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
