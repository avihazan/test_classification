8. Exercise. This Option shall be exercised by notice to the Company, accompanied by

(ii) an election to exercise this Option by means of a “cashless exercise,” so long as you have the right at the time to sell and dispose of the Option Shares which are the subject of such cashless existence. The procedure and form for any such permitted “cashless exercise” will be provided to you. However, any “cashless exercise” is subject to the insider trading rules under the federal securities laws.  
  
You are prohibited by the federal securities laws from selling or otherwise trading in any of the Company’s common stock at a time when you are in possession of material information which has not been publicly disclosed. You also agree that you will be subject to the Company’s “black-out” policy and to the Company’s “blackout” periods during the term of your employment with the Company and for three (3) months following any termination of employment for any reason. 

9\. Rights as a Shareholder. You shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares which may be purchased by exercise of this Option unless and until a certificate representing such shares is duly issued and delivered to you. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued except as may be determined in accordance with Section 12(c) of the Plan. 

10\. Withholding Taxes. The Company’s obligation to deliver shares upon the exercise of this Option shall be subject to your satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income tax, employment tax and withholding requirements.

In addition, during any such period as Option Shares may not be sold or otherwise disposed of under this Agreement, those Option Shares shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of. In the event the terms of this paragraph are not complied with or if any such Option Shares so restricted are subject to execution, attachment or similar process, any such transfer shall be null and void.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER, AS SET FORTH IN THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND __________, DATED __________, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.  
  
(c) Stop-Transfer Notices. You agree that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records. 

12\. Anti-Dilution Provisions. If prior to expiration of this Option, there shall occur any change in the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of such shares of common stock, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar event, and as often as the same shall occur, then the kind and number of shares subject to this Option, or the purchase price per share of such common stock, or both, may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) in such manner as it may deem equitable, the determination of which shall be binding and conclusive. Failure of the Committee to provide for any such adjustment shall be conclusive evidence that no adjustment is required. 

13\. Acceptance of Provisions. The execution of this Agreement by you shall constitute your acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

14\. Change in Control. Option Shares may be sold or disposed of at and following the consummation of a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Plan).

(ii) All Confidential Information is the property of the Company and neither your employment nor the disclosure of such information to you should be construed to grant any right, license or authorization to you to use the Confidential Information except in connection with the performance by you of the services for which you are employed by the Company.

(iii) You will comply with all regulations established by the Company to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will not remove Confidential Information from your place of employment without the express consent of the Company.  
(iv) On termination of your employment with the Company or at any other time as the Company may request, you shall end all use of any Confidential Information and return to the Company all originals and copies of any Confidential Information then in or thereafter coming into your possession (in whatever form and however such Confidential Information might be obtained or recorded).

In the case of a termination of employment by the Company for any other reason than by “Cause” (as defined in Section 5(c)), the Restriction Period shall terminate immediately upon the employee’s termination of employment.  
For purposes of any prior award agreement providing for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units or other equity awards by the Company, the “Restriction Period” for any restrictive covenant included in such equity award agreement shall terminate immediately upon the employee’s termination of employment by the Company for any reason other than “Cause” (as such term is defined in Section 5(c) above).  
(iii) You agree that the above restrictions are reasonable and necessary in light of your position and responsibilities with the Company.  
  
(a)  Remedies  
(i) You acknowledge that the Company will not have an adequate remedy at law for your breach of any provision of this Section 15. You consent to the entry of injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief against you with respect to any such breach (without proof of monetary or immediate damage and without any bond or other security being required), in addition to any other remedies which might be available to the Company at law or in equity.  
(ii) Upon your breach of this Section 15, (a) all outstanding options granted to you to purchase common stock of the Company, whether granted pursuant to this Agreement or any earlier agreement regardless of whether vested or not vested in whole or in part, shall be cancelled and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs within two years following the exercise of any such option, you shall be required to repay to the Company any gain realized upon the exercise of such option (with such gain valued as of the date of exercise). Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in the Company’s common stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the fair market value of common stock on the day prior to the date of payment) and the Committee or the Board is hereby permitted and expressly authorized by you to offset against any future payments owed by the Company or of its subsidiaries to you (including any salary, bonus, severance or other compensation) to satisfy the repayment obligation. The determination of whether you have breached this Section 15 shall be determined by the Committee or the Board in good faith. This Section 15 shall have no application following a termination of employment following a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).  
  
* * *  
  
(iii) You agree to reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys) incurred by the Company in connection with any action by the Company seeking to enforce this Section 15 if and to the extent the Company is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have prevailed on the merits in such action.  
For purposes of any prior award agreement providing for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units or other equity awards by the Company, the condition to such reimbursement of costs and expenses that the Company must have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have prevailed on the merits on such action shall also apply to all such prior equity award agreements.  
(iv) If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Section 15, as written, is too broad in scope or duration to be enforceable, such provision should be narrowed in scope and duration to the extent (and only to such extent) necessary to make such provision enforceable. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Section 15 shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.  
  
16\. Venue and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Any claim brought by you arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Plan (as incorporated herein by reference), the subject matter thereof, or the performance or non-performance of any obligation thereunder (other than a counterclaim maintained by you in an action originally brought by the Company), shall be brought in either the state or federal courts located in the State of New Jersey. You hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of each of the state or federal courts located in the State of New Jersey for the purposes of any suit, civil action or other proceeding ("Suit") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Plan, the subject matter thereof, or the performance or non-performance of any obligation thereunder. You hereby waive and agree not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise in any such Suit, any claim that you are not subject to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the State of New Jersey, that such Suit is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of such Suit is improper. You hereby consent to service of process by first-class mail with respect to any action brought by the Company against you arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Plan. 

YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PLAN, THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF, OR THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY OBLIGATION THEREUNDER.

17\. Miscellaneous. This Agreement and the Plan contain a complete statement of all the arrangements between the parties with respect to their subject matter, and this Agreement cannot be changed except in a writing executed by both parties. However, if and to the extent that the terms of any employment agreement between you and the Company as then in effect modify this Agreement, then while such employment agreement is then in effect, the terms of such employment agreement shall control as between the employment agreement and this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey applicable to agreements made and to be performed exclusively in New Jersey. The headings in this Agreement are solely for the convenience of reference and shall not affect its meaning or interpretation.
