Annual Incentive Plan for the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs;

  
(iv) For the Continuation Period, AESC shall either (A) arrange to provide the Executive and his or her dependents, at AESC's cost, with life, disability, medical and dental coverage, whether insured or not insured, providing substantially similar benefits to those which the Executive and his or her dependents were receiving immediately prior to the Date of Termination, to the extent the AE Companies continues to maintain benefit plans providing for such benefits for executives generally or (B) in lieu of providing such coverage, pay to the Executive within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination a lump sum amount in cash equal to two (2) times the projected cost to AESC of providing the extended benefit coverage referred to in clause (A) (as such cost shall be calcu lated by a nationally recognized benefit consulting firm using reasonable assumptions), provided, however, that such benefits set forth above in clauses (A) and (B) shall be reduced by and to the extent that comparable benefits are received from a new employer.

  
(v) This Section 9(b)(v) shall apply only if, as of the Date of Termination, the Executive shall have completed 15 "Years of Service," as defined in the Allegheny Energy, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). In such event, AESC shall pay to the Executive the benefits the Executive would have been entitled to receive under the SERP if (A) the Executive had been age 55 or older on the Date of Termination, (B) the Continuation Period had counted in determining the Executive's "Years of Service" for purposes of benefit calculation under the SERP (the Continuation Period shall not, however, be taken into account in determining whether the Executive has completed 15 "Years of Service" for purposes of the first sentence of this Section 9(b)(v)) and (C) amount paid during the Continuation Period to the Executive pursuant to this Section 9(b) were counted in determining the Executive's "Average Compensation," as defined in the SERP, for purposes of benefit calculation under the SERP.

Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), (C) be paid in such form as the Executive shall elect from those available under the Retirement Plan (subject to adjustment, if paid in a form other than a life annuity, by using the actuarial equivalence factors of the Retirement Plan) and (D) be subject to reduction, in accordance with the SERP, if benefit payments commence prior to the Executive's attainment of age 60 (such benefits cannot be commenced prior to the Executive's attainment of age 55), provided, however, that su ch reduction for early commencement of benefits shall not be applicable in the event that the Executive is at least age 50 as of the Date of Termination.

  
(vi) The exercise period of all stock options that were granted to the Executive under the LTIP and that are vested on the Date of Termination shall continue for one (1) year after the Date of Termination; provided, however, that in no event shall such vested options be exercised later than the date of expiration of the vested options determined pursuant 6.02(b)(i) or 6.02(b)(iii) of the LTIP.

  
(vii) All other obligations of AESC under this Agreement shall cease forthwith.

  
(c) Contractual Rights to Benefits. This Agreement establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he or she is entitled hereunder. The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9(b)(iv), the obtaining of any such employment shall have no effect on AESC's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement.

  
  
  
10. Conditions to Receipt of Post-Termination Benefits. As a condition to receiving any post-termination payments or benefits to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled under Section 9(b) of this Agreement (the "Post Termination Benefits"), the Executive shall execute a release (the "Release"), in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to AESC, of any claims, whether arising under Federal, state or local statute, common law or otherwise, against the AE Companies and their respective officers, directors and stockholders which arise or may have arisen on or before the date of the Release, other than any claims for Post Termination Benefits under this Agreement or any rights to indemnification from the AE Companies pursuant to any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of any of the AE Companies or any directors and officers liabil ity insurance policies maintained by any of the AE Companies. If the Executive fails or otherwise refuses to execute a Release within a reasonable time after AESC's request to do so, the Executive will not be entitled to any Post Termination Benefits. In addition, if, following a termination of employment that gives the Executive a right to any Post Termination Benefits, the Executive engages in any activities that violate any of the covenants referred to in Section 7, the Employee shall have no further right or claim to any Post Termination Benefits and shall promptly repay any Post Termination Benefits previously received (such repayment to be in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the AE Companies in respect of such violation).
