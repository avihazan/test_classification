EXHIBIT 10.3

CERIDIAN CORPORATION

2004 LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN



(U.S. Employee)

This Agreement between you, [NAME], and Ceridian Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is effective as of [GRANT DATE] (the “Date of Grant”) and evidences the grant of a Restricted Stock award pursuant to the Ceridian Corporation 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Any capitalized term used in this Agreement which is defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan, unless otherwise defined herein.

1. Award. Effective as of the Date of Grant, the Company has granted to you [NUMBER OF SHARES] shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Common Stock”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan (the “Awarded Shares”).

2. Restrictions on Transferability. Awarded Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise used as collateral by you unless and until, and then only to the extent that, restrictions on transferability shall have lapsed in accordance with the Plan and this Agreement. In this Agreement, the lapsing of such transferability restrictions is referred to as “vesting,” and Awarded Shares that are no longer subject to such transferability restrictions are referred to as “vested.”

3. Book-Entry Registration. Ownership of Awarded Shares which are not yet vested shall not be evidenced by a stock certificate, but rather shall be evidenced by an entry in a certificateless book-entry stock account maintained by the Company’s transfer agent for its Common Stock (the “Transfer Agent”) or another custodian designated by the Company. You will receive written notification from the Company of the vesting of all or a portion of your Awarded Shares, and you will receive written instructions on how you may transfer or obtain a stock certificate for your unrestricted shares. To facilitate the transfer to the Company of any Awarded Shares that you might subsequently forfeit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, you agree to sign and promptly return to the Company with a signed copy of this Agreement such stock power(s) as the Company may request.

4. Vesting of Awarded Shares. Subject to Sections 5, 6 and 10 of this Agreement, one-third of the Awarded Shares will vest during the period of your employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement) on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Date of Grant.

5. Termination of Employment. If your employment with the Company and all Subsidiaries terminates due to death or Disability (as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement), all unvested Awarded Shares will immediately and fully vest. If your employment with the Company 

* * *

  


and all Subsidiaries terminates for any other reason prior to a Change of Control (as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement), you will immediately forfeit to the Company any Awarded Shares that have not yet vested as of the employment termination date.

6. Impact of a Change of Control. If a Change of Control occurs, all unvested Awarded Shares will immediately and fully vest.

7\.  Rights with Respect to the Awarded Shares. With respect to the Awarded Shares, you shall be entitled to exercise the rights of a shareholder of Common Stock of the Company, including the right to vote the Awarded Shares and the right to receive dividends thereon as provided in Section 8 of this Agreement, unless and until the Awarded Shares are forfeited pursuant to Section 5 hereof. Your rights with respect to the Awarded Shares shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date or dates on which the Awarded Shares vest, and the restrictions with respect to the Awarded Shares lapse, in accordance with Sections 4, 5 or 6 hereof.

8. Dividends and Distributions. If there is any change in the number or character of the Common Stock of the Company (through any stock dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares or otherwise), you shall then receive upon such vesting the number and type of securities or other consideration which you would have received if such Awarded Shares had vested prior to the event changing the number or character of the outstanding Common Stock. Any additional shares of Common Stock, any other securities of the Company and any other property (including cash dividends or other cash distributions) distributed with respect to the Awarded Shares prior to the date the Awarded Shares vest and become free of restrictions on transferability shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as the Awarded Shares to which they relate, shall be promptly deposited with the Transfer Agent or another custodian designated by the Company and shall be distributed to you at the same time the Awarded Shares become free of restrictions on transferability.

9. Continued Employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate your employment at any time.

10. Prohibited Activities.

(a) You agree that you will not take any Adverse Actions (as defined in Section 10(b) below) against the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the period that the Award Shares have not vested in full or at any time before one year following your termination of employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, whichever is later (the “Restricted Period”). You acknowledge that damages which may arise from a breach of this Section 10 may be impossible to ascertain or prove with certainty. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Company determines in its sole discretion that you have taken Adverse Actions against the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the Restricted Period, in addition to other legal

2

* * *

  


remedies which may be available, (i) the Company will be entitled to an immediate injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to end such Adverse Action, without further proof of damage, (ii) you will forfeit any Awarded Shares that are not yet vested effective the date on which you enter into such activity, and (iii) any taxable income realized by you from the grant or vesting of Awarded Shares during a period beginning six months prior to the date on which you enter into such activity shall be paid by you to the Company.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, an “Adverse Action” will mean any of the following: (i) failing to adhere to the Company’s Code of Conduct; (ii) engaging in any commercial activity in competition with any part of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary as conducted during the Restricted Period; (iii) diverting or attempting to divert from the Company or any Subsidiary any business of any kind, including, without limitation, interference with any business relationships with suppliers, customers, licensees, licensors, clients or contractors; (iv) participating in the ownership, operation or control of, being employed by, or connected in any manner with any person or entity which solicits, offers or provides any services or products similar to those which the Company or any Subsidiary offers to its customers or prospective customers; (v) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person or entity to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company or any Subsidiary that is disparaging or that in any way reflects negatively on the Company or any Subsidiary; or (vi) engaging in any other activity that is hostile, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company or any Subsidiary, including, without limitation, influencing or advising any person who is employed by or in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary to leave such employment or service to compete with the Company or any Subsidiary or to enter into the employment or service of any actual or prospective competitor of the Company or any Subsidiary, influencing or advising any competitor of the Company or any Subsidiary to employ to otherwise engage the services of any person who is employed by or in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary, or improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any trade secrets or confidential information regarding the Company or any Subsidiary.

(c) Should any provision of this Section 10 of the Agreement be held invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Section 10 of the Agreement, but, rather, this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hall be construed and enforced accordingly. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, you expressly agree that should the duration of or geographical extent of, or business activities covered by, any provision of this Agreement be in excess of that which is valid or enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities that may validly or enforceably be covered. You acknowledge the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulate that this Agreement shall be construed in a manner that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law. This Section 10 of the Agreement does not replace and is in addition to any other agreements you may have with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the matters addressed herein. This Section 10 shall not apply to any termination which takes place on or following a Change of Control.

11. Payment of Amounts Owed. By accepting this Agreement, you consent to a reduction from any amounts the Company owes you from time to time (including wages or other compensation) of any amount you owe the Company under Section 10 of the Agreement. If the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount you owe it, you agree to immediately repay the unpaid balance to the Company.  
  


12. Tax Withholding. In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are your sole and absolute responsibility, are withheld or collected from you. In order to assist you in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon the grant or vesting of the Awarded Shares, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit you to satisfy such tax obligations by (a) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Awarded Shares otherwise to be delivered upon vesting with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes or (b) delivering to the Company Shares other than the vested Awarded Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes. The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
