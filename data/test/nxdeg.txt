* * *

(ii) If (A) the Employers terminate the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for any reason other than for Cause effective as of a date that is not within a Change of Control Period or (B) the Executive terminates the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for Good Reason effective as of a date that is not within a Change of Control Period, the Employers shall pay the Executive, provided the Executive concurrently signs and delivers a general release in a commercially reasonable form that is mutually acceptable to the Employers and the Executive in favor of the Employers and their respective subsidiaries, an amount equal to the sum of (w) the Accrued Obligations, (x) the Benefit Obligations and (y) the Executive’s Base Salary as of the effective date of termination of the Executive’s employment under this Agreement the Executive would have received had the Executive remained employed under this Agreement for the Subsequent Period. The Employers shall pay such amounts to the Executive at the same time and in the same installments had the Executive remained employed under this Agreement for the Subsequent Period. 

(iii) If (A) the Employers terminate the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for Cause or because of the death or Permanent Disability of the Executive or (B) the Executive terminates the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for any reason other than Good Reason, the Executive’s death or Permanent Disability, or (C) the Employers terminate this Agreement as a result of the death or Permanent Disability of the Executive effective as of a date that is not within a Change of Control Period, the sole obligation of the Employers to the Executive under this Agreement shall be to pay the Accrued Obligations to the Executive or the Executive’s estate, provided, however, that in the event the Employers terminate the employment of the Executive under this Agreement because of the death of the Executive, the Employers shall pay to the personal representatives of the Executive an amount equal to the Executive’s Base Salary and incentive for the remainder of the Term. 

(iv) No provision of this Agreement shall adversely affect any vested rights of the Executive under the Employers’ existing employee benefit plans or other plans the Employers may establish in the future; provided, however, upon the termination of the employment of the Executive as provided in this Agreement, all future vesting of the Executive’s rights under all existing and any future employee benefit plans shall terminate without further action by the Employers. 

(v) The Employers and the Executive intend that this Agreement be drafted and administered in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including, but not limited to, any future amendments to Section 409A, and any other Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other governmental rulings or interpretations (together, “Section 409A”) issued pursuant to Section 409A so as not to subject the Executive to payment of interest or any 

-5- 

* * *

additional tax under Section 409A. The Employers and the Executives intend for any payments under paragraphs 1(e)(i), (ii) or (iii) to satisfy either the requirements of Section 409A or to be exempt from the application of Section 409A, and the Employers and the Executive shall construe and interpret this Agreement accordingly. In furtherance of such intent, if payment or provision of any amount or benefit under this Agreement that is subject to Section 409A at the time specified in this Agreement would subject such amount or benefit to any additional tax under Section 409A, the Employers shall postpone payment or provision of such amount or benefit to the earliest commencement date on which the Employers can make such payment or provision of such amount or benefit without incurring such additional tax but not in excess of six months. In addition, to the extent that any IRS guidance issued under Section 409A would result in the Executive being subject to the payment of interest or any additional tax under Section 409A, the Employers and the Executive agree, to the extent reasonably possible, to amend this Agreement in order to avoid the imposition of any such interest or additional tax under Section 409A. Any such amendment shall have the minimum economic effect necessary and be determined reasonably and in good faith by the Employers and the Executive. 

(vi) If a payment under paragraph 1(e)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this Agreement does not qualify as a short-term deferral under Section 409A or any similar or successor provisions, and the Executive is a Specified Employee, as defined in this Agreement, as of the Executive’s Termination Date, the Employers may not make such distributions to the Executive before a date that is six months after the date of the Executive’s Termination Date or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death (the “Six-Month Delay”). The Employers shall accumulate payments to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the Termination Date (the “Six-Month Delay Period”) and make such payments on the first day of the seventh month following the Executive’s Termination Date. Notwithstanding the Six-Month Delay set forth in this paragraph 1(e)(vi): 

(A) To the maximum extent Section 409A or any similar or successor provisions permit, during each month of the Six-Month Delay Period, the Employers will pay the Executive an amount equal to the lesser of (I) the total monthly severance for which paragraph 1(e)(ii) and (iii) provide or (II) one-sixth of the lesser of (1) the maximum amount that Section 401(a)(17) permits to be taken into account under a qualified plan for the year in which the Executive’s Date of Termination occurs and (2) the sum of the Executive’s annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Employers for the taxable year of the Executive preceding the taxable year of the Executive in which the Executive’s Termination Date occurs, adjusted for any increase during that year that the parties expected to continue indefinitely if the Executive’s Termination Date has not occurred ; provided that amounts paid under this sentence will count toward, and 

-6- 

* * *

will not be in addition to, the total payment amount the Employers have the obligation to pay to the Executive under paragraphs 1(e)(i) and (ii) of this Agreement; and 

(B) To the maximum extent Section 409A, or any similar or successor provisions, permits within ten days following the Executive’s Termination Date, the Employers shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the applicable dollar amount under Section 402(g)(1)(B) for the year in which the Executive’s Termination Date occurred; provided that the amount the Employers pay under this sentence may include, and need not be in addition to, the total payment amount this Agreement requires the Employers to pay to the Executive under paragraph 1(b). 

(C) For purposes of this Agreement, “Specified Employee” has the meaning given that term in Section 409A or any similar or successor provisions. The Employers’ “specified employee identification date” as described in Section 409A will be December 31 of each year, and the Employers’ “specified employee effective date” as described in Section 409A or any similar or successor provisions) will be February 1 of each succeeding year. 

(f) In the event that the independent registered public accounting firm of either of the Employers or the IRS determines that any payment, coverage or benefit provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the excise tax imposed by Sections 280G or 4999 or any successor provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 or any interest or penalties the Executive incurs with respect to such excise tax, the Employers, within 30 days thereafter, shall pay to the Executive, in addition to any other payment, coverage or benefit due and owing under this Agreement, an additional amount that will result in the Executive’s net after tax position, after taking into account any interest, penalties or taxes imposed on the amounts payable under this paragraph 1(f), upon the receipt of the payments for which this Agreement provides being no less advantageous to the Executive than the net after tax position to the Executive that would have been obtained had Sections 280G and 4999 not been applicable to such payment, coverage or benefits. Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, tax counsel, whose selection shall be reasonably acceptable to the Executive and the Employers and whose fees and costs shall be paid for by the Employers, shall make all determinations this paragraph 1(f) requires. 

(g) In the event that the independent registered public accounting firm of either of the Employers or the IRS determines that any payment, coverage or benefit due or owing to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the excise tax Section 409A imposes or any successor provision of Section 409A or any interest or penalties, including interest imposed under Section 409(A)(1)(B)(i)(I), the Executive incurs as a result of the application of such provision, the Employers, within 30 days of the date of such impositions, 

-7- 

* * *

shall pay to the Executive, in addition to any other payment, coverage or benefit due and owing under this Agreement, an additional amount that will result in the Executive’s net after tax position, after taking into account any interest, penalties or taxes imposed on the amounts paid under this paragraph 1(g), being no less advantageous to the Executive than the net after tax position the Executive would have obtained had Section 409A not been applicable to such payment, coverage or benefits. Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, tax counsel, whose selection shall be reasonably acceptable to the Executive and the Employers and whose fees and costs the Employers shall pay, shall make all determinations this paragraph 1(g) requires. 

(h) The Employers and the Executive shall give any notice of termination of this Agreement to the Executive or the Employers, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 10.

(b) The Executive shall devote substantially all of the Executive’s business time and attention to the performance of the Executive’s duties under this Agreement and, during the term of the Executive’s employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall not engage in any other business enterprise that requires any significant amount of the Executive’s personal time or attention, unless granted the prior permission of the respective Boards. The foregoing provision shall not prevent the Executive’s purchase, ownership or sale of any interest in, or the Executive’s engaging in, any business that does not compete with the business of the Employers or the Executive’s involvement in charitable or community activities, provided, that the time and attention that the Executive devotes to such business and charitable or community activities does not materially interfere with the performance of the Executive’s duties under this Agreement and that a material portion of the time the Executive devotes to charitable or community activities are devoted to charitable or community activities within the Employers’ market area and further provided that such conduct complies in all material respects with applicable policies of the Employers.

fullest extent applicable law permits for any matter in any way relating to the Executive’s employment by, consultation with or other affiliation with the Employers or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that if the Employers shall have terminated the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for Cause, then, except to the extent otherwise required by law, the Employers shall have no obligation whatsoever to indemnify the Executive for any claim arising out of the matter for which the Employer shall have terminated the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for Cause or for any conduct of the Executive not within the scope of the Executive’s duties under this Agreement.

10\. Notice. Any notice that a party to this Agreement may give under this Agreement shall be in writing and be deemed given when hand delivered and acknowledged or, if mailed, one day after mailing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or if delivered by an overnight delivery service, one day after the notice is delivered to such service, to the Employers or the Executive at their respective addresses stated in the preamble to this Agreement, or at such other address as either party may by similar notice designate.

15\. Waiver of Breach. The failure at any time to enforce or exercise any right under any of the provisions of this Agreement or to require at any time performance by the other parties of any of the provisions hereof shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provisions or to affect either the validity of this Agreement or any part of this Agreement, or the right of any party hereafter to enforce or exercise its rights under each and every provision in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
