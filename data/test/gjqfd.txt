NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the terms and conditions set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Executive and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

1. Employment by the Company and Term.   
  
(a) Duties. Subject to the terms set forth herein, the Company agrees to employ Executive as Chairman of the Board and Executive hereby accepts such employment.

(b) Full Time and Best Efforts. During the Term, Executive shall apply, on a full-time basis, all of his skill and experience to the performance of his duties hereunder and shall not, without the prior consent of the Board, devote substantial amounts of time to outside business activities.

Corporate Opportunity is within the Company’s or any of its Affiliates’ existing lines of business or its existing plans to expand; (b) the extent to which the Corporate Opportunity supplements the Company’s or any of its Affiliates’ existing lines of activity or complements the Company’s or any of its Affiliates’ existing methods of service; (c) whether the Company has available resources that can be utilized in connection with the Corporate Opportunity; (d) whether the Company is legally or contractually barred from utilizing the Corporate Opportunity; (e) the extent to which utilization of the Corporate Opportunity by Executive would create conflicts of interest with the Company or any of its Affiliates; and (f) any other factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or such disinterested and independent Board members deem(s) appropriate under the circumstances.

(a) Confidential Information. Executive agrees that, during the Term or at any time thereafter: 

(1) Executive shall not use for any purpose other than the duly authorized business of Company, or disclose to any third party, any information relating to Company or any of its Affiliates which is proprietary to Company or any of its Affiliates (“Confidential Information”), including any customer list, contact information, rate schedules, programming, data, plans, intellectual property, trade secret or any written (including in any electronic form) or oral communication incorporating Confidential Information in any way (except as may be required by law or in the performance of Executive’s duties under this Agreement consistent with Company’s policies) regardless of whether or not such information has been labeled as “confidential”; and 

(2) Executive shall comply with any and all confidentiality obligations of Company to a third party, whether arising under a written agreement or otherwise. 

(b) Work For Hire.

If, for any reason, any of such results and proceeds are not legally deemed a work-made-for-hire and/or there are any rights in such results and proceeds which do not accrue to Company under the preceding sentence, then Executive hereby irrevocably assigns and agrees to assign any and all of Executive’s right, title and interest thereto, whether now known or hereafter defined or discovered, and Company shall have the right to use the work in perpetuity in any location and in any manner Company determines in its sole discretion without any further payment to Executive.

(2) Executive shall do any and all things which Company may deem useful or desirable to establish or document Company’s rights in any such results and proceeds, including, without limitation, the execution of appropriate copyright, trademark and/or patent applications, assignments or similar documents and, if Executive is unavailable or unwilling to execute such documents, Executive hereby irrevocably designates the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent or his designee as Executive’s attorney-in-fact with the power to execute such documents on Executive’s behalf. To the extent Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive’s services under this Agreement that cannot be assigned as described above, Executive unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights. 

(3) Works-made-for-hire do not include subject matter that meets all of the following criteria: (A) is conceived, developed and created by Executive on Executive’s own time without using the Company’s or any of its Affiliate’s equipment, supplies or facilities or any trade secrets or confidential information, (B) is unrelated to the actual or reasonably anticipated business or research and development of Company or any of its Affiliates of which Executive is or becomes aware; and (C) does not result from any work performed by Executive for Company or any of its Affiliates. 

(c) Return of Property. All documents, data, recordings, equipment or other property, whether tangible or intangible, including all information stored in electronic form, obtained or prepared by or for Executive and utilized by Executive in the course of Executive’s employment with Company or any of its Affiliates shall remain the exclusive property of Company and shall not be removed from the premises of the Company under any circumstances whatsoever without the prior written consent of the Company, except when (and only for the period) necessary to carry out Executive’s duties hereunder, and if removed shall be immediately returned to the Company upon any termination of his employment and no copies thereof shall be kept by Executive; provided, however, that Executive shall be entitled to retain documents reasonably related to his prior interest as a shareholder. Upon termination of employment, Executive shall promptly return all property of Company or any of its Affiliates. 

(d) Use of Executive’s Name, Image and Likeness. Company may make use of Executive’s name, photograph, drawing or other likeness in connection with the advertising or the giving of publicity to Company, Parent or a program broadcast or content provided by Company, Parent or any Affiliates. In such regard, Company may make recordings, transcriptions, videotapes, films and other reproductions of any and all actions performed by Executive in his or her capacity as an Executive of Company, including without limitation any voice-over or announcing material provided by Executive (collectively “Executive Performances”). Company shall have the right to broadcast, display, license, assign or use any Executive Performances on a royalty-free basis without additional compensation payable to Executive. 

7. Noninterference.   
  
While employed by the Company and for a period of two years thereafter, Executive agrees not to interfere with the business of the Company by directly or indirectly soliciting, attempting to solicit, inducing, or otherwise causing any executive or material employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate his or her employment in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor to or for any other Company.

8. Noncompetition.   
  
Executive agrees that during the Term and for a period of two years thereafter, he shall not, without the prior consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, be employed by, be connected with, or have an interest in, as an employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, stockholder or joint venturer, in any person or entity owning, managing, controlling, operating or otherwise participating or assisting in any business that is in competition with the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates (a) during the Term, in any location, and (b) for the two-year period following the termination of this Agreement, in any province, state or jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its Affiliates was conducting business at the date of termination of Executive’s employment and continues to do so thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent Executive from being a stockholder of less than one percent of the issued and outstanding securities of any class of a corporation listed on a national securities exchange or designated as national market system securities on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph shall not operate to limit Executive’s ability to provide non-confidential information to, serve on the board of directors of, or be employed by any 501(c)(3) organization, including any such organization operating non-commercial radio station(s). 

9. Remedies.   
  
Executive acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by Executive of any the provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7 or 8 will result in the Company and its stockholders suffering irreparable harm which cannot be calculated or fully or adequately compensated by recovery of monetary damages alone. Accordingly, Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to interim, interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies, in addition to any other relief to which the Company may become entitled should there be such a breach or threatened breach. 

10. Personal Conduct.   
  
Executive agrees to promptly and faithfully comply with all present and future policies, requirements, directions, requests and rules and regulations of the Company in connection with the Company’s business, including without limitation the policies and requirements set forth in Parent’s Employee Handbook, Code of Ethical Conduct and Financial Code of Conduct. Executive further agrees to comply with all laws and regulations pertaining to Executive’s employment with the Company. Executive hereby agrees not to engage in any activity that is in direct conflict with the essential interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Executive hereby acknowledges that nothing set forth in the Employee Handbook, Code of Ethical Conduct or Financial Code of Conduct or any other policy issued by the Company or Parent shall be deemed to create a separate contractual obligation, guarantee or inducement between Executive and the Company.

11. Indemnification.   
  
The Company shall indemnify Executive to the fullest extent permitted by law, in effect at the time of the subject act or omission, and shall advance to Executive reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses as such fees and expenses are incurred (subject to an undertaking from Executive to repay such advances if it shall be finally determined by a judicial decision which is not subject to further appeal that Executive was not entitled to the reimbursement of such fees and expenses). Executive shall be entitled to the protection of any insurance policies that the Company may elect to maintain generally for the benefit of its directors and officers against all costs, charges and expenses incurred or sustained by him in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (other than any action, suit or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement) to which Executive may be made a party by reason of his being or having been a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or his serving or having served any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company. The Company covenants to maintain during Executive’s employment for the benefit of Executive (in his capacity as an officer and director of the Company) Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance providing benefits to Executive no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the benefits provided to the other senior executives of the Company by the Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance maintained by the Company on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Board may elect to terminate Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance for all officers and directors, including Executive, if the Board determines in good faith that such insurance is not available or is available only at unreasonable expense.

(b) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no further appeal lies or is taken, that provision shall be deemed to be severed herefrom, and all remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable. 

(c) Entire Agreement. This document constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement and understanding between the parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and preempts any prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the parties, written or oral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as provided in this Agreement, all understandings and agreements, written or oral, relating to the employment of Executive by the Company or the payment of any compensation or the provision of any benefit in connection therewith or otherwise, are hereby terminated and shall be of no further force and effect.

(e) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive and the Company, and their respective successors and assigns, except that Executive may not assign any of his duties hereunder and he may not assign any of his rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company. 

(f) Amendments. No amendments or other modifications to this Agreement may be made except by a writing signed by both parties. No amendment or waiver of this Agreement requires the consent of any individual, partnership, corporation or other entity not a party to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any third person any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 

(g) Attorneys’ Fees. If any legal proceeding is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, or to recover damages for breach therefore, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees, as well as costs and disbursements, in addition to other relief to which he or it may be entitled. 

(h) Choice of Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of California. 

(i) Resolution of Disputes. Company and Executive mutually agree to resolve any and all legal claims arising from or in any way relating to Executive’s employment with Company through mediation or, if mediation does not resolve the claim or dispute within ten (10) days of notice demanding mediation, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act subject to the terms and conditions provided below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, insured workers’ compensation claims (other than wrongful discharge claims) and claims for unemployment insurance are excluded from arbitration under this Agreement. This Agreement does not prevent the filing of charges with administrative agencies such as the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or equivalent state agencies. Arbitration shall be conducted in Ventura County, California in accordance with any of the following, at Executive’s election: (a) the JAMS® Employment Rules of Procedure, or (b) the rules of procedure issued by another alternative dispute resolution service mutually acceptable to Executive and Company.

All other rights, remedies, exhaustion requirements, statutes of limitations and defenses applicable to claims asserted in a court of law shall apply in the arbitration. Executive expressly waives any presumption or rule, if any, which requires this Agreement to be construed against the Company. 

(j) Integration. This Agreement comprises the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and shall supersede all other prior written or oral agreements, including without limitation the Old Employment Agreement.
