Section 1.5. Voting. Except as the Articles of Incorporation otherwise provide, at any meeting of the shareholders, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders’ meeting.

Section 1.6. Notice of Shareholder Business. (a) At an annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the scheduled annual meeting, regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of that meeting to a later date; provided, however, that in the event that less than seventy (70) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled annual meeting is given or made, notice by a shareholder, to be timely, must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such public disclosure was made. A shareholder’s notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books of the shareholder proposing such business and of any other person or entity who is the record or beneficial owner of any shares of the Corporation and who, to the knowledge of the shareholder proposing such business, supports such proposal, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned and owned of record by the shareholder proposing such business on the date of his notice to the Corporation and the number of shares so owned by any person or entity who, to the knowledge of the shareholder proposing such business, supports such proposal and (d) any material interest (financial or other) of such shareholder in such proposal. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.6. The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.6. and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

The inspectors shall determine the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the results, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. On request of the Chairman of the meeting, the inspectors shall make a report of any challenge, request or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them.

Directors

Section 2.1. General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors and, except as otherwise expressly provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, all of the powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under the authority of said Board of Directors.

Section 2.2. Number and Qualification. The Board of Directors shall consist of twelve (12) Directors; provided, that as of the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors shall consist of nine (9) Directors. Except for individuals who are on the Board of Directors on April 21, 2004 (who may be reelected one or more times, regardless of age), no one who is seventy years of age or older shall be eligible to stand for election to the Board of Directors.

As more particularly described in the Articles of Incorporation, the directors shall be divided into three classes (A, B and C) as nearly equal in number as possible. The initial term of office for members of Class A shall expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders after their election; the initial term of office for members of Class B shall expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders after their election; and the initial term of office for members of Class C shall expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders after their election. At each annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and election, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, and shall continue to hold office until their respective successors are elected and qualify.

In the event of any increase or decrease in the number of directors fixed by the Bylaws, all classes of directors shall be increased or decreased as equally as may be possible. Newly-created directorships resulting from an increase by not more than two in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or other cause, shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, whether or not a quorum. Each director so

chosen shall hold office until the expiration of the term of the director, if any, whom he has been chosen to succeed or, if none, until the expiration of the term of the class assigned to the additional directorship to which he has been elected, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of each class of the voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding at a meeting called for that purpose.

Section 2.3. Election of Directors.

Advisory Directors shall be entitled only to notice of meetings of Advisory or other Boards of the Corporation to which they shall be appointed. Honorary and Advisory Directors shall receive such compensation as may be authorized by the Board of attendance at meetings of Advisory or other Boards to which such Advisory or Honorary Directors are appointed.

Section 2.5. Nominations. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 shall be eligible for election as Directors.

To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the scheduled annual meeting, regardless of postponements, deferrals, or adjournments of that meeting to a later date; provided, however, in the event that less than seventy (70) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a Director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person and (iv) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as to the shareholder
