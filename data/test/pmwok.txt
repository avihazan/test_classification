4\. Quorum. A quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the Board of Directors shall be a majority of the number of directors determined from time to time to comprise the Board of Directors, and the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the directors.

  


5\. Removal. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all of the directors of this Corporation may be removed from office for cause by the stockholders of this Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of this Corporation. Notice of any such annual or special meeting of stockholder shall state that the removal of a director or directors for cause is among the purposes of the meeting.

7\. Elections. When a quorum is present at any meeting for the election of directors, the vote required for election of a director by stockholders, other than in a contested election, shall be the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast with respect to the director nominee. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast “for” a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that director. In a contested election, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes “for” their election, up to the number of directors to be elected, shall be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes either “for” or “against” a nominee.

  


The election is “contested” if (i) the Secretary of the Corporation has received a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article VI, Section 8 hereof and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the tenth business day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting to the stockholders.

Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of this Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of: (a) the Board of Directors; (b) by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board; (c) or by any stockholder of this Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Article VI, Section 8.
