Exhibit 10a 

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 



2005–07 AWARD CYCLE 

AGREEMENT between Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.

1\. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant. 

2\. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Verizon Communications Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a restricted stock award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. The RSUs and this Agreement (including the covenants set forth in Exhibit A (the “Covenants”), which are incorporated into and shall be a part of the Agreement) are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan, this Agreement, and by the actions of the Human Resources Committee of Verizon Communication’s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee. To the extent that there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. 

3\. Contingency. The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained herein. If the Participant does not properly accept (or revokes acceptance of) this Agreement the Participant shall not be entitled to the RSUs regardless of the extent to which the vesting requirements in paragraph 5 (“Vesting”) are satisfied. 

4\. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified on their account under the 2005 RSU grant, administered by Fidelity Investments. A RSU is a hypothetical share of Verizon’s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to the closing price of Verizon’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of such date. A RSU does not represent an equity interest in Verizon and carries no voting rights. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be added to each RSU each time that a dividend is paid on Verizon’s common stock. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the dividend paid on a share of Verizon’s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the average of the high and low sales prices of Verizon’s common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the dividend payment date of each declared dividend on Verizon’s common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’s RSU balance. 

5\. Vesting.

(a) General. The Participant shall vest in the RSUs only if the Participant is continuously employed by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through the end of the Award Cycle, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee. For purposes of these RSUs, “Award Cycle” shall mean the three-year period beginning on January 1, 2005, and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2007. 

(b) Transfer. Transfer of employment from Verizon to a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13), from a Related Company to Verizon, or from one Related Company to another Related Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder, and service with a Related Company 

* * *

shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of the three-year continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). 

6\. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in cash. As soon as practicable after the end of the Award Cycle (but in no event later than March 15, 2008), except as described in paragraph 7(c), the value of the vested RSUs (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the Participant (subject, however, to any deferral application that the Participant has made under the deferral plan (if any) then available to the Participant). The amount of cash that shall be paid (plus withholding for taxes and any applicable deferral election) shall equal the number of vested RSUs times the closing price of Verizon’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the last trading day in the Award Cycle. If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’s beneficiary. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the RSU shall be canceled. 

7\. Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 7(c) and 5, RSUs may vest or be forfeited before vesting as follows: 

(a) Retirement Before July 1, 2005, Voluntary Separation On or Before December 31, 2007 or Discharge for Cause On or Before December 31, 2007. 

(1) If the Participant (i) Retires (as defined in paragraph 7(b)(4)) before July 1, 2005, (ii) quits on or before December 31, 2007, (iii) is terminated for Cause (as defined below) on or before December 31, 2007, or (iv) separates from employment on or before December 31, 2007 under circumstances not described in paragraph 7(b), all then-unvested RSUs shall be canceled immediately and shall not be payable. 

(2) For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means (i) grossly incompetent performance or substantial or continuing inattention to or neglect of the duties and responsibilities assigned to the Participant; fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement involving the Company; or a material breach of the Verizon Code of Business Conduct or any of the Covenants set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement, all as determined by the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon in his or her discretion, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding, or (ii) commission of any felony of which the Participant is finally adjudged guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

(b) Retirement After June 30, 2005, Involuntary Termination Without Cause On or Before December 31, 2007, Termination Due to Death or Disability On or Before December 31, 2007. 

(1) This paragraph 7(b) shall apply if the Participant: 

(i) Retires (as defined below) after June 30, 2005, or 

(ii) Separates from employment by reason of an involuntary termination without Cause (as determined by the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon), death, or disability (as defined below) on or before the last day of the Award Cycle. “Disability” shall mean the total and permanent disability of the Participant as defined by, or determined under, the Company’s long-term disability benefit plan. 

(2) If the Participant separates from employment prior to the end of the Award Cycle under circumstances described in paragraph 7(b)(1), the Participant’s then-unvested RSUs shall vest without regard to the three-year continuous employment requirement set forth in paragraph 5(a), 

* * *

provided that the Participant does not commit a material breach of any of the Covenants and provided that the Participant executes a release satisfactory to the Company waiving any claims he or she may have against the Company. 

(3) Any RSUs that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(b)(2) shall be payable as soon as practicable after the end of the Award Cycle (but in no event later than March 15, 2008), except as described in paragraph 7(c). However, the Committee retains the discretion to determine whether and the extent to which the Participant is eligible to receive DEUs with respect to dividends declared after the Participant’s separation from employment pursuant to paragraph 7(b)(1), and the Committee’s exercise of this discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. 

(4) For purposes of this Agreement, “Retire” means (i) to retire after having attained at least 15 years of Net Credited Service (as defined under the Verizon Management Pension Plan) and a combination of age and years of Net Credited Service that equals or exceeds 75 points, or (ii) retirement under any other circumstances determined in writing by the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon. 

(c) Change in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of Verizon (as defined in the Plan) on or before the last day of the Award Cycle, all then-unvested RSUs shall vest and be payable immediately (without prorating of the award) without regard to the three-year continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). A Change in Control that occurs after the end of the Award Cycle shall have no effect on whether any RSUs vest or become payable. A Participant who receives the immediate award payment provided in this paragraph 7(c) shall be entitled to receive payment for all DEUs earned before the Change in Control, even if such DEUs are paid or payable after the Change in Control. 

(d) Vesting Schedule. Except and to the extent provided in paragraphs 7(b) and (c), nothing in this paragraph 7 shall alter the vesting schedule prescribed by paragraph 5. 

8\. Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to shares of common stock to which this grant relates. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no adjustment shall be made, for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs while the RSUs are outstanding. 

9\. Revocation or Amendment of Agreement. Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether the Participant has been terminated for Cause, has a disability, or has satisfied the three-year continuous employment requirement), the Committee or the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon may not, without the written consent of the Participant, (a) revoke this Agreement insofar as it relates to the RSUs granted hereunder, or (b) make or change any determination or change any term, condition or provision affecting the RSUs if the determination or change would materially and adversely affect the RSUs or the Participant’s rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the Committee or the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon from exercising reasonable administrative discretion with respect to the Plan or this Agreement, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. 

10\. Assignment. The RSUs shall not be assigned, pledged or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the Participant’s lifetime, the RSUs may be deferred only by the Participant or by the Participant’s guardian or legal representative in accordance with the deferral regulations, if any, established by the Company. 

* * *

11\. Beneficiary. The Participant shall designate a beneficiary in writing and in such manner as is acceptable to the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon. If the Participant fails to so designate a beneficiary, or if no such designated beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary shall be the Participant’s estate. 

12\. Other Plans and Agreements. Any payment received by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination of the Participant’s benefits under any pension, savings, group insurance, severance or other benefit plan maintained by Verizon or a Related Company. The Participant acknowledges that receipt of this Agreement or any prior RSU agreement shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any other plans maintained by the Company or a Related Company. 

13\. Company and Related Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Company” means Verizon Communications Inc. “Related Company” means (a) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership or proprietary interest of 50 percent or more, or (b) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds an ownership or other proprietary interest of less than 50 percent but which, in the discretion of the Committee, is treated as a Related Company for purposes of this Agreement. 

14\. Employment Status. The grant of the RSUs shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company and the Participant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ of any such Company or Related Company. 

15\. Withholding. The Participant shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of RSUs, and the Company shall make such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 

16\. Securities Laws. The Company shall not be required to make payment with respect to any shares of common stock prior to the admission of such shares to listing on any stock exchange on which the stock may then be listed and the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law or rulings or regulations of any government body that the Company, in its discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. 

17\. Committee Authority. The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Committee in its discretion and such exercise shall be final, conclusive, and binding. The Committee may designate any individual or individuals to perform any of its functions hereunder. 

18\. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the RSUs may have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’s death, to refer to and be binding upon the Participant’s heirs and beneficiaries. 

19\. Construction. This Agreement is intended to grant the RSUs upon the terms and conditions authorized by the Plan. Any provisions of this Agreement that cannot be so administered, interpreted, or construed shall be disregarded. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder of this 

* * *

Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision, including any Covenant, is held to be unenforceable for being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. 

20\. Defined Terms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate. 

21\. Execution of Agreement. The Participant shall indicate consent to the terms of this Agreement (including its Exhibit) and the Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise complying with the requirements of paragraph 3. The Participant and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if the Participant and Verizon executed this Agreement (including its Exhibit) in paper form. 

22\. Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the Participant shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any of the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph 22 does not prevent the Participant from disclosing the terms of this Agreement to the Participant’s spouse or beneficiary or to the Participant’s legal, tax, or financial adviser, provided that the Participant take all reasonable measures to assure that the individual to whom disclosure was made does not disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party except as otherwise required by law. 

23\. Applicable Law. The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. 

24\. Notice. Any notice to the Company provided for in this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of the Executive Vice President – Human Resources of Verizon at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036, and any notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the current address shown on the payroll of the Company, or to such other address as the Participant may designate to the Company in writing. Any notice shall be delivered by hand, sent by telecopy or enclosed in a properly sealed envelope as stated above, registered and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post office regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service. 

25\. Dispute Resolution.

(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 26 below, all disputes arising under the Plan or this Agreement and all claims in which a Participant seeks damages that relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan are subject to the dispute resolution procedure described below in paragraph 25. The parties to this Agreement are not required to arbitrate Employment Claims, as defined in subsection (a)(ii) below, in which the Participant does not seek damages that relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan or this Agreement. 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Award Dispute” shall mean any claim against the Company or a Related Company regarding (A) the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, (B) any of the terms or conditions of the RSUs issued under this Agreement, or (C) allegations of entitlement to RSUs or additional RSUs, or any other benefits under the Plan, other than Employment Claims described in subparagraph (ii) below; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the forfeiture of an award as a 

* * *

result of a breach of any of the Covenants contained in Exhibit A shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures provided for in this paragraph 25\. 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Damages Dispute” shall mean any employment related claims between the Participant and the Company or a Related Company or against the directors, officers, employees, representatives, or agents of the Company or a Related Company, including claims of alleged employment discrimination, wrongful termination, or violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other federal, state or local law, statute, regulation, or ordinance relating to employment or any common law theories of recovery relating to employment, such as breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims (“Employment Claims”), in which the damages sought relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan. 

(b) Internal Dispute Resolution Procedure. All Units Award Disputes shall be referred in the first instance to the Verizon Employee Benefits Committee (“EB Committee”) for resolution internally within Verizon. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, all Units Award Disputes must be filed in writing with the EB Committee no later than one year from the date that the dispute accrues. Consistent with paragraph 25(c)(i) of this Agreement, decisions about the enforceability of the limitations period contained herein are for the arbitrator to decide. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the EB Committee shall have full power, discretion, and authority to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Units Award Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement before them. Determinations made by the EB Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to subsection (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. 

(c) Arbitration. All appeals from determinations of Units Award Disputes by the EB Committee as described in subsection (b) above, as well as all Units Damages Disputes, shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for final and binding arbitration on an individual basis (and not on a collective or class action basis) before a single arbitrator pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time this grant is accepted. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, all appeals of Units Award Disputes and all Units Damages Disputes must be filed in writing with the AAA no later than one year from the date that the appeal or dispute accrues. Consistent with paragraph 25(c)(i) of this Agreement, decisions about the enforceability of the limitations period contained herein are for the arbitrator to decide. If the Participant and either the Company or a Related Company are party to any prior agreement to arbitrate claims before the AAA under rules other than its Commercial Arbitration Rules, claims that are arbitrable under any such agreements shall be submitted to the AAA for disposition under its Commercial Arbitration Rules together with disputes that are arbitrable under this Agreement in order to promote expeditious and efficient dispute resolution. A copy of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The arbitration shall be held at the office of the AAA nearest the place of the Participant’s most recent employment by the Company or a Related Company, unless the parties agree to a different location. All claims by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Covenants, shall also be raised in such arbitration proceedings. 

(i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement is enforceable and whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement, existing Company policy, and applicable substantive state and 

* * *

federal law and shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief which could be awarded by a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and enforceable in any applicable court. 

(ii) The Participant understands and agrees that when Units Award Disputes or Units Damages Disputes are submitted for arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity, to have a trial by jury, or to resolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis, and that the sole forum available for the resolution of such issues is arbitration as provided herein. This dispute resolution procedure shall not prevent either the Participant or the Company or a Related Company from commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm pending arbitration hereunder; in such event, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company agree that the party who commences the action may proceed without necessity of posting a bond.

(iii) In consideration of the Participant’s agreement in subsection (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and arbitrator’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. 

(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units Award Disputes and Units Damages Disputes. Their agreement in this regard shall be interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent. 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this dispute resolution provision shall be governed by laws of the State of New York to the extent that it is not governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. 

26\. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause), the Participant acknowledges that— 

(a) The Covenants in Exhibit A to this Agreement are essential to the continued goodwill and profitability of the Company; 

(b) The Participant has broad-based skills that will serve as the basis for employment opportunities that are not prohibited by the Covenants in Exhibit A; 

(c) When the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates, the Participant shall be able to earn a livelihood without violating any of the Covenants in Exhibit A; 

(d) Irreparable damage to the Company shall result in the event that the Covenants in Exhibit A are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company from a breach of these Covenants; 

* * *

(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Covenants in Exhibit A, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy, and no bond or other security shall be required in connection therewith; 

(f) Such Covenants shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation of this Agreement; 

(g) The Participant’s breach of any of such Covenants shall result in the Participant’s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and 

(h) All disputes relating to such Covenants, including their interpretation and enforceability and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such Covenants, shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction.
