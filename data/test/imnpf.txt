Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall perform such services at such other locations as may be required for the proper performance of his duties hereunder, and Executive recognizes that such duties may involve travel. 

7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; EFFECT OF TERMINATION  
  
(a) Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated by the Company at any time: 

(i) upon the determination that Executive’s performance of his duties has not been fully satisfactory for any reason which would not constitute justifiable cause (as hereinafter defined) or for other business reasons necessitating termination which do not constitute justifiable cause, in either case upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Executive; or 

(ii) upon the determination that there is justifiable cause (as hereinafter defined) for such termination. 

(b) Executive’s employment shall terminate upon: 

(i) the death of Executive; 

(ii) the “total disability” of Executive (as hereinafter defined in Subsection (c) herein) pursuant to Subsection (h) hereof; or 

(iii) Executive’s resignation of employment. 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “total disability” shall mean Executive is physically or mentally incapacitated so as to render Executive incapable of performing the essentials of Executive’s job, even with reasonable accommodation, as reasonably determined by the Company, which determination shall be final and binding. 

(d) For the purposes hereof, the term “justifiable cause” shall mean: any failure or refusal to perform any of the duties pursuant to this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement by the Executive; Executive’s breach of any material written policies, rules or regulations which have been adopted by the Company; Executive’s repeated failure to perform his duties in a 

3 

* * *

satisfactory manner; Executive’s performance of any act or his failure to act, as to which if Executive were prosecuted and convicted, a crime or offense involving money or property of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or a crime or offense constituting a felony in the jurisdiction involved, would have occurred; any unauthorized disclosure by Executive to any person, firm or corporation of any confidential information or trade secret of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; any attempt by Executive to secure any personal profit in connection with the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates; or the engaging by Executive in any business other than the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates which interferes with the performance of his duties hereunder. Upon termination of Executive’s employment for justifiable cause, this Agreement shall terminate immediately and Executive shall not be entitled to any amounts or benefits hereunder other than such portion of Executive’s annual base salary and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to Section 5 hereof as have been accrued through the date of his termination of employment. 

(e) If the Company terminates this Agreement without “justifiable cause” as provided in Subsection 7 (a) (i), the Company shall pay Executive his then current base salary for five months after the effectiveness of such termination, payable in equal payments in accordance with the Company’s customary payroll practices. However, if Executive is employed or retained, as an employee, independent contractor, consultant or in any other capacity or if he is offered another position by the Company at a comparable salary (“New Employment”) prior to or during the time he receives payment under this Subsection or Subsection 3 (b), the Company is entitled to a credit for all sums paid or earned by Executive during this period of time or which he could have earned had he accepted the comparable position by the Company. The Executive must make a good faith effort to find New Employment and mitigate the amount of money to be paid by the Company to Executive under this Subsection or Subsection 3(b). Executive also agrees to immediately notify the Company if and when he is offered another position and/or accepts another position. The Company will pay any amount due and owing in accordance with the payment schedule in 3(a), until paid in full. Any payment pursuant to this paragraph 7(e) is contingent upon Executive’s execution of a general release and separation agreement in a form acceptable to the Company and will be in lieu of payments to which Executive might have been entitled under any other severance plan of the Company. 

(f) If Executive shall die during the term of his employment hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate immediately. In such event, the estate of Executive shall thereupon be entitled to receive such portion of Executive’s base annual salary and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to Section 4 as have been accrued through the date of his death. 

(g) Upon Executive’s “total disability”, the Company shall have the right to terminate Executive’s employment. Any termination pursuant to this Subsection (g) shall be effective on the earlier of (i) the date 30 days after which Executive shall have received written notice of the Company’s election to terminate or (ii) the date he begins to receive long-term disability insurance benefits under the policy provided by the Company pursuant to Section 5 hereof. 

(h) Upon the resignation of Executive in any capacity, that resignation will be deemed to be a resignation from all offices and positions that Executive holds with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates. In the event of Executive’s resignation, he 

4 

* * *

shall be entitled only to receive such portion of his annual base salary and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to Section 4 as have been accrued through the date of his resignation. 

(i) Change of Control. In the event the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company during the Term without justifiable cause within twelve months following a Change of Control of the Company occurring during the Term then, in such event, the Company shall pay Executive an amount equal to twelve (12) months of base annual salary in effect at the time of the termination, which amount will be subject to mitigation in accordance with Section 7(e) above. For the purposes of the foregoing, Change of Control shall have the meaning set forth in the Company’s 2006 Incentive Stock Option Plan (without regard to any subsequent amendments thereto). Any payment pursuant to this paragraph 7(i) is contingent upon Executive’s execution of a general release and separation agreement in a form acceptable to the Company and will be in lieu of payments to which Executive might have been entitled under paragraph 7(e) of this Agreement or under any other severance plan of the Company. 

8. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A  
  
(a) General. It is the intention of both the Company and the Executive that the benefits and rights to which the Executive could be entitled pursuant to this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and other guidance promulgated or issued thereunder (“Section 409A”), to the extent that the requirements of Section 409A are applicable thereto, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with that intention. If the Executive or the Company believes, at any time, that any such benefit or right that is subject to Section 409A does not so comply, it shall promptly advise the other and shall negotiate reasonably and in good faith to amend the timing of such benefits and rights such that they comply with Section 409A (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Executive). 

(b) Distributions on Account of Separation from Service. If and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A, no payment or benefit required to be paid under this Agreement on account of termination of the Executive’s employment shall be made unless and until the Executive incurs a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. 

(c) 6 Month Delay for “Specified Employees”. 

(i) If the Executive is a “specified employee”, then no payment or benefit that is payable on account of the Executive’s “separation from service”, as that term is defined for purposes of Section 409A, shall be made before the date that is six months after the Executive’s “separation from service” (or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death) if and to the extent that such payment or benefit constitutes deferred compensation (or may be nonqualified deferred compensation) under Section 409A and such deferral is required to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. Any payment or benefit delayed by reason of the prior sentence shall be paid out or provided in a single lump sum at the end of such required delay period in order to catch up to the original payment schedule. There shall be added to any payments that are delayed pursuant to this provision interest at the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal for the date on 

5 

* * *

which the Executive Separated from Service from the date on which the payment otherwise would have been made until the date on which the payment is made. 

(ii) For purposes of this provision, the Executive shall be considered to be a “specified Executive” if, at the time of his or her separation from service, the Executive is a “key Executive”, within the meaning of Section 416(i) of the Code, of the Company (or any person or entity with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or Section 414(c) of the Code) any stock in which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise. 

(d) No Acceleration of Payments. Neither the Company nor the Executive, individually or in combination, may accelerate any payment or benefit that is subject to Section 409A, except in compliance with Section 409A and the provisions of this Agreement, and no amount that is subject to Section 409A shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it may be paid without violating Section 409A. 

(e) Treatment of Each Installment as a Separate Payment. For purposes of applying the provisions of Section 409A to this Agreement, each separately identified amount to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In addition, to the extent permissible under Section 409A, any series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 

(f) Taxable Reimbursements. 

(i) Any reimbursements by the Company to the Executive of any eligible expenses under this Agreement that are not excludable from the Executive’s income for Federal income tax purposes (the “Taxable Reimbursements”) shall be made by no later than the earlier of the date on which they would be paid under the Company’s normal policies and the last day of the taxable year of the Executive following the year in which the expense was incurred. 

(ii) The amount of any Taxable Reimbursements to be provided to the Executive during any taxable year of the Executive shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement to be provided in any other taxable year of the Executive. 

(iii) The right to Taxable Reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

9. REPRESENTATION AND AGREEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE  
  
(a) Executive represents and warrants that he is free to enter into this Agreement and to perform the duties required hereunder, and that there are no employment contracts or understandings, restrictive covenants or other restrictions, whether written or oral, preventing the performance of his duties hereunder. 

(b) Executive agrees to submit to a medical examination and to cooperate and supply such other information and documents as may be required by any insurance company in 

6 

* * *

connection with the Company’s obtaining life insurance on the life of Executive, and any other type of insurance or fringe benefit as the Company shall determine from time to time to obtain. 

(c) Executive represents and warrants that he has never been convicted of a felony and he has not been convicted or incarcerated for a misdemeanor within the past five years, other than a first conviction for drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray, or disturbance of the peace. 

(d) Executive represents and warrants that he has never been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding that resulted in a judgement, decree, or final order (i) enjoining him from future violations of, or prohibiting any violations of any federal or state securities law, or (ii) finding any violations of any federal or state securities law. 

(e) Executive represents and warrants that he has never been accused of any impropriety in connection with any employment; 

Any breach of any of the above representations and warranties is “justifiable cause” for termination under Section 7(d) of this Agreement. 

10. NON-COMPETITION  
  
(a) Executive agrees that during his employment by the Company and during the two (2) year period following the termination of Executive’s employment hereunder (the “Non-Competitive Period”), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, as owner, partner, joint venturer, stockholder, employee, broker, agent, principal, trustee, corporate officer, director, licensor, or in any capacity whatsoever, engage in, become financially interested in, be employed by, render any consultation or business advice with respect to, accept any competitive business on behalf of, or have any connection with any business which is competitive with products or services of the Company or any subsidiaries and affiliates, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are then conducting or proposing to conduct business, including, without limitation, the United States of America and its possessions, Canada and Europe; provided, however, that Executive may own any securities of any corporation which is engaged in such business and is publicly owned and traded but in an amount not to exceed at any one time one percent (1%) of any class of stock or securities of such corporation. In addition, Executive shall not, during the Non-Competitive Period, directly or indirectly, request or cause any suppliers or customers with whom the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates has a business relationship to cancel or terminate any such business relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates or otherwise compromise the Company’s good will or solicit, hire, interfere with or entice from the Company any employee (or former employee) of the Company. 

(b) If any portion of the restrictions set forth in this Section 10 should, for any reason whatsoever, be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such restrictions shall not thereby be adversely affected. For the purposes of this Section 10, a business competitive with the products and services of the Company (or such subsidiaries and affiliates) is limited to a specialty retailer which primarily distributes, sells or 

7 

* * *

markets so-called “big and tall” apparel of any kind for men or which utilizes the “big and tall” retail or wholesale marketing concept as part of its business. 

(c) Executive acknowledges that the Company conducts business throughout the world, that Executive’s duties and responsibilities on behalf of the Company are of a worldwide nature, that its sales and marketing prospects are for continued expansion throughout the world and therefore, the territorial and time limitations set forth in this Section 10 are reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. In the event any such territorial or time limitation is deemed to be unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction, Executive agrees to the reduction of the territorial or time limitation to the area or period which such court shall deem reasonable. 

(d) The existence of any non-material claim or cause of action (a “non-material” claim or cause of action is defined as a claim or cause of action which results from something other than a material breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by the Company) by Executive against the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the foregoing restrictive covenants, but such claim or cause of action shall be litigated separately. 

11. INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES  
  
(a) Upon execution of this Agreement and thereafter, Executive shall promptly and fully disclose to the Company, and with all necessary detail for a complete understanding of the same, all existing and future developments, know-how, discoveries, inventions, improvements, concepts, ideas, writings, formulae, processes and Methods (whether copyrightable, patentable or otherwise) made, received, conceived, acquired or written during working hours, or otherwise, by Executive (whether or not at the request or upon the suggestion of the Company) during the period of his employment with, or rendering of advisory or consulting services to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates, solely or jointly with others, in or relating to any activities of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates known to him as a consequence of his employment or the rendering of advisory and consulting services hereunder (collectively the “Subject Matter”). 

(b) Executive hereby assigns and transfers, and agrees to assign and transfer, to the Company, all his rights, title and interest in and to the Subject Matter, and Executive further agrees to deliver to the Company any and all drawings, notes, specifications and data relating to the Subject Matter, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further papers, including applications for copyrights or patents, as may be necessary to obtain copyrights and patents for any thereof in any and all countries and to vest title thereto to the Company. Executive shall assist the Company in obtaining such copyrights or patents during the term of this Agreement, and at any time thereafter on reasonable notice and at mutually convenient times, and Executive agrees to testify in any prosecution or litigation involving any of the Subject Matter; provided, however, that Executive shall be compensated in a timely manner at the rate of $250 per day (or portion thereof), plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred in rendering such assistance or giving or preparing to give such testimony if it is required after the termination of this Agreement.

12. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
  
(a) Executive acknowledges that the Company possesses certain confidential and propriety information that has been or may be revealed to him or learned by Executive during the course of Executive’s employment with the Company and that it would be unfair to use that information or knowledge to compete with or to otherwise disadvantage the Company. Executive shall not, during the term of this Agreement or at any time following termination of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, disclose or permit to be known (other than as is required in the regular course of his duties (including without limitation disclosures to the Company’s advisors and consultants), as required by law (in which case Executive shall give the Company prior written notice of such required disclosure) or with the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity, any confidential information acquired by him during the course of, or as an incident to, his employment or the rendering of his advisory or consulting services hereunder, relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates, the directors of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates, any supplier or customer of the Company or any of their subsidiaries and affiliates, or any corporation, partnership or other entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any of the foregoing, or in which any of the foregoing has a beneficial interest, including, but not limited to, the business affairs of each of the foregoing.

9 

* * *

provide an adequate remedy to the Company.

10 

* * *

Agreement) to others, including businesses or entities that may employ, do business with, or consider employing Executive in the future. Executive further agrees that any subsequent change or changes in his duties, compensation or areas of responsibility shall in no way affect the validity of this Agreement or otherwise render inapplicable any of the provisions of paragraphs 10 through 13 of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect except as may be modified by a subsequent written agreement.
