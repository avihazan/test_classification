The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

(b) The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorney fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation. Nothing contained herein shall eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for: (i) any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) voting for or assenting to a distribution in violation of Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-106-401 or these articles of incorporation if it is established that the director did not perform such director’s duties in compliance with Colorado Revised Statutes § 7-106-401, provided that the personal liability of a director in this circumstance shall be limited to the amount of the distribution which exceeds what could have been distributed without violation of Colorado Revised Statutes 7-106-401 or these articles of incorporation; or (iv) any transaction from which the director directly or indirectly derives an improper personal benefit.

(e) Expenses (including attorney fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding as authorized in (c) or (d) of this Article upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent to repay such amount unless it is ultimately determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article .

(f) The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive or any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, and any procedure provided for by any of the foregoing, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent and shall inure to the benefit of heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.

(g) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Corporation or who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under provisions of this Article .
