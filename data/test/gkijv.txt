5\. Option Nontransferable. Optionee may not transfer or assign all or any part of the Option other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. This Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of Optionee, only by Optionee, or in the event of Optionee’s legal incapacity, by Optionee’s guardian or legal representative acting on behalf of Optionee in a fiduciary capacity under state law and court supervision. 

6\. Notice of Exercise; Payment. 

(a) To the extent then exercisable, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by written notice to the Company stating the number of Option Shares for which the Option is being exercised and the intended manner of payment.

Payment equal to the aggregate Option Price of the Option Shares being purchased pursuant to an exercise of the Option must be tendered in full with the notice of exercise to the Company in one or a combination of the following methods as specified by Optionee in the notice of exercise: (i) cash in the form of currency or check or by wire transfer as directed by the Company, (ii) solely following an IPO or shares of the Company’s Class A-1 Common Stock otherwise being traded on an established securities market, through the surrender to the Company of shares of Class A-1 Common Stock owned by Optionee for at least six months as valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or (iii) through such other form of consideration as is deemed acceptable by the Board. 

(b) As soon as practicable upon the Company’s receipt of Optionee’s notice of exercise and payment, the Company shall direct the due issuance of the Option Shares so purchased. 

(c) As a further condition precedent to the exercise of this Option in whole or in part, Optionee shall comply with all regulations and the requirements of any regulatory authority having control of, or supervision over, the issuance of the shares of Class A-1 Common Stock and in connection therewith shall execute any documents which the Board shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable. 

7\. Termination of Agreement. The Agreement and the Option granted hereby shall terminate automatically and without further notice on the earliest of the following dates: 

(a) after Optionee’s termination of service as a Director of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the lesser of (i) ninety (90) calendar days following the Optionee’s date of termination or (ii) the remaining term of the Option; 

(b) The date of Optionee’s termination of service as a Director of the Company and its subsidiaries for Cause; or 

(c) Ten (10) years from the Grant Date. 

In the event that Optionee’s employment is terminated in the circumstances described in Section 7(b) hereof, this Agreement shall terminate at the time of such termination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and Optionee’s option will cease to be exercisable to the extent exercisable as of such termination and will not be or become exercisable after such termination. Upon the Optionee’s termination of service as Director of the Company, and, if applicable, its Subsidiaries, all Options which are not then exercisable shall immediately terminate. 

8\. Call Right. Upon termination of Optionee’s service as a Director for any reason prior to an IPO, the Company will have the right to purchase (the “Call Right”) any Option Shares that Optionee

received pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in Article VI Call Rights of the Stockholders Agreement. 

9\. Initial Public Offering. Option Shares acquired on exercise of any Option will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Stockholders’ Agreement. The Company and Optionee acknowledge that they will agree to provide the Company with the right to require Optionee and other executives of the Company or any Subsidiary to waive any registration rights with regard to such Option Shares upon an IPO, in which case the Company will implement an IPO bonus plan in cash, stock or additional options to compensate for Optionee’s and the other executives’ loss of liquidity. 

10\. No Contract. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a) confer upon Optionee any right to continue in service as a Director of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) limit or affect in any manner the right of the Company’s stockholders to elect or remove Directors. 

11\. Compliance with Law. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option shall not be exercisable if the exercise thereof would result in a violation of any such law. 

12\. Adjustments. The Board may make or provide for such substitution or adjustments in the number of Option Shares covered by this Option, in the Option Price applicable to such Option, and in the kind of shares covered thereby and/or such other equitable substitution or adjustments as the Board may determine to prevent dilution or enlargement of Optionee’s rights that otherwise would result from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary cash-dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) any merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reclassification, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, or other distribution of assets or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing. Such substitutions and adjustments may include, without limitation, canceling any and all Options in exchange for cash payments equal to the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration paid to a shareholder of an Option Share over the Option Price per share subject to such Option in connection with such an adjustment event. 

13\. Relation to Other Benefits. Any economic or other benefit to Optionee under this Agreement shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which Optionee may be entitled under any plan maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan, if any, covering Optionee. 

14\. Amendments. Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto; provided, however, that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of Optionee under this Agreement without Optionee’s written consent. 

15\. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable. 

16\. Relation to Plan. This Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. In the event of any inconsistent provisions between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. The Board acting pursuant to the Plan, as constituted from time to time, shall, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, have the right to determine any questions which arise in connection with the Option or its exercise.
