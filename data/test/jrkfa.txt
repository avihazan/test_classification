THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of March 23, 2011 by and between Kensington Leasing, Ltd., a Nevada corporation (“Kensington”), and Angelique de Maison (“Purchaser”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the promises, covenants and conditions contained herein, the Parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE OF SHARES

1.1 Purchase and Sale.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Kensington hereby agrees to issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase from Kensington, shares of common stock (“Common Stock”) of Kensington (the “Kensington Shares”) at the applicable Per Share Purchase Price (defined below) as follows (each of the following, an “Installment”):

(i) Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Kensington shall issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Kensington, 300,000 Kensington Shares (the “First Installment”).

(ii) Upon closing of the transactions contemplated by that certain Exchange Agreement (the “Closing”), dated the date hereof, by and among Kensington, Wikifamilies SA (“Wikifamilies”), and certain other signatories thereto (the “Exchange Agreement”), Kensington shall issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Kensington, 600,000 Kensington Shares (the “Second Installment”).

(iii) If on or prior to the 15th day following the end of each month in the Call Period, Kensington sends to Purchaser a written notice (the “Call Notice”) requesting that Purchaser purchase an amount of shares of Common Stock, Purchaser shall purchase such amount of Common Stock, up to an aggregate purchase price of $100,000 (i.e. there shall be no obligation to pay more than $100,000 to purchase shares in any calendar month), within five business days of the date of the Call Notice. The “Call Period” is the period commencing on the first day of the calendar month following the Closing and ending on the last day of the 18th calendar month thereafter. Each purchase pursuant to a Call Notice is herein referred to as a “Monthly Installment.”

Exhibit 10.4

(c) If the Pre-Tax Profit Target is not met as of the last day of any calendar quarter during the Call Period, the Per Share Purchase Price for each Monthly Installment shall be $0.20 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 1.1(d). In such event: (i) all future purchases in the Monthly Installments shall be at a Per Share Purchase Price of $0.20 per share, and (ii) the Per Share Purchase Price for all prior Installments shall be retroactively adjusted to $0.20 per share. Such adjustment shall be effected by issuing to Purchaser, no later than the last business day of the month immediately following the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Pre-Tax Profit Target was not met, for no additional consideration, such additional number of Kensington Shares as necessary such that in effect, the Per Share Purchase Price for all Kensington Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement equals $.20.

(d) If on or prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under Section 1.1(a) of this Agreement (i) Kensington shall subdivide its capital stock (by any stock split, stock dividend or otherwise), (ii) Kensington shall combine the outstanding shares of its capital stock, or (iii) there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of Kensington’s capital stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), the Per Share Purchase Price then in effect shall be correspondingly adjusted for all future issuances of Common Stock under this Agreement, and Kensington shall notify Purchaser of such adjustment. Corresponding adjustments shall also be made in the event of any retrospective adjustments to Per Share Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.1(c).

(e) The “Pre-Tax Profit Target” shall be considered met as of the last day of a calendar quarter if (i) the pre-tax income or loss, as applicable, of Wikifamilies for such calendar quarter shall not be less than the pre-tax income or greater than the pre-tax loss, as applicable, for such quarter as set forth on the Approved Budget; and (ii) the cumulative pre-tax income or loss, as applicable, of Wikifamilies for the period commencing on the first applicable date of the Approved Budget and ending the last day of such calendar quarter shall not be less than the cumulative pre-tax income or greater than the pre-tax loss, as applicable, for such period as set forth on the Approved Budget.

(f) The “Approved Budget” shall mean the budget of Wikifamilies for the period beginning March 1, 2011 and continuing for the remainder of the Call Period, as approved in writing by Purchaser and Kensington on the date hereof, or as modified by mutual agreement of the Parties, which modification shall require the consent of Wikifamilies if such modification is prior to the Closing.

(g) Each Call Notice shall include an unaudited income statement of Wikifamilies, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, applied consistently with Kensington’s past practices, for the applicable periods to determine whether the Pre-Tax Profit Target has been met. If no Call Notice is provided in the month immediately following the end of a calendar quarter, the foregoing information shall be separately provided to Purchaser within 30 days of the end of the calendar quarter. In the event that Wikifamilies is merged into Kensington or into any subsidiary of Kensington at any time prior to the last calendar quarter within the Call Period, Kensington shall account for Wikifamilies as a separate profit and accounting unit in order to permit calculations set forth herein. Purchaser will have the right to inspect the books and records of Wikifamilies and, if applicable, Kensington, for purposes of reviewing the calculations set forth herein, provided that Purchaser shall maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information about Purchaser or Kensington that she acquires in connection with her investigation.
