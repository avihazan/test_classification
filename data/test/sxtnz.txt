1\. Restricted Stock Award. The Company hereby grants to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth or incorporated herein, an Award consisting of a total of  shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment under the Plan (the “Shares”). Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will, subject to Section 6 below, issue to the Participant the Shares granted hereunder, and such Shares shall constitute Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan.

* * *

3\. Restriction Period. The restriction period applicable to the Award granted hereunder is as follows: 

(a) All Shares shall be unvested at issuance. Subject to Section 3(b) below, 25% of the Shares shall vest on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversary date of this Agreement (or the following business day if such date is not a business day) if the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company on such date; provided, that 100% of the Shares shall vest if Participant’s employment is earlier terminated as a result of the Participant’s death or Disability. 

(b) Following a “Change of Control” (as defined herein), vesting of unvested Shares shall not accelerate by reason of such Change of Control; provided, however, that 100% of the Shares shall vest if, following a Change of Control, the employment of the Participant is terminated by the Company or by the Subsidiary without Cause, or the Participant resigns with Good Reason. 

(c) All unvested Shares shall automatically be forfeited (and shall not vest) if the Participant’s employment with the Company shall terminate for any reason (other than as provided in Section 3(b) above in the case of termination by the Company without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason following a Change in Control) prior to the earlier of the date on which they otherwise would have vested pursuant to Section 3(a) above. 

(d) Participant shall be entitled to receipt of all dividends paid by the Company on its Shares, as and when such dividends are declared and paid to holders of Shares; provided, any dividends on unvested Shares shall be held and paid to Participant within 10 days after the vesting of such Shares after becoming vested. 

4\. Stockholders Agreement. This Award and any Common Stock issued with respect to this Award are subject to restrictions on transfer and requirements of sale and other provisions as set forth herein and in the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement among Burlington Stores, Inc. and certain investors and managers, dated as of March 13, 2014 (the “Stockholders Agreement”). This Award and any Common Stock issued with respect to it constitute “Management Shares” as defined therein. The Participant’s rights with respect to the Award and shares of Common Stock issued with respect to this Award are subject to the restrictions and other provisions contained in the Plan and the Stockholders Agreement in addition to such other restrictions, if any, as may be imposed by law. In the event of a conflict between the Plan and the Stockholders Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement shall control. Furthermore, by acceptance of this Award, the undersigned agrees hereby to become a party to, and be bound by the terms of, the Stockholders Agreement as a Manager (and to the extent the undersigned is not already a party thereto, the undersigned shall execute a joinder thereto in form and substance acceptable to the Company). 

5\. Withholding Taxes. The Administrator may make such provision for any applicable federal or state the withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 6(a)(4) of the Plan. In addition, at least sixty (60) days prior to the time of vesting of any Shares granted under this Agreement, the Company will give notice thereof to the Participant.

Participant shall deliver to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy all United States federal, state and local and non-United States tax of any kind (including Participant’s FICA and SDI obligations) which the Board, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to be withheld or remitted with respect to the Shares in order to comply with the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and/or any other applicable law, rule or regulation (the “Minimum Withholding Tax”). Alternatively, at the Participant’s election, exercisable on or before ten (10) days prior to the date of vesting of such Shares, the Company shall have the right and power to deduct or withhold a number of Shares having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of vesting thereof) equal to the Minimum Withholding Tax; provided, however, that such option to shall be deemed to have been exercised in the case of accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 3(a) in the case of Participant’s death or Disability or pursuant to Section 3(b) in the case of termination of Participant’s employment by the Company or the Subsidiary or by the Participant for Good Reason following a Change of Control. Participant shall remain responsible for the payment of any remaining taxes payable on account of the vesting of Shares. 

6\. Delivery of Stock. Shares granted pursuant to this Agreement will be held in escrow by the Company on the Participant’s behalf during any period of restriction thereon and will bear an appropriate legend specifying the applicable restrictions thereon. Whenever Shares subject to the Award are released from restriction, the Company shall issue such unrestricted Shares. The Company shall follow all requisite procedures to deliver such Shares to Participant; provided, however, that such delivery may be postponed to enable the Company to comply with applicable procedures, regulations or listing requirements of any governmental agency, stock exchange or regulatory agency. Alternatively, at the Company’s discretion, shares may be held by the Company or its transfer agent on the Participant’s behalf in book entry form. 

7\. Transferability of Award. This Award may only be transferred by will, and by the laws of descent and distribution (and in connection therewith, such transferees must agree in writing (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to become a party to, and be bound by, the Stockholders Agreement). The terms of this Award, including the restriction and vesting provisions set forth in Section 3, shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the Participant.

9\. Section 83(b) Election. Participant agrees to inform the Company promptly, and provide a copy of the election filed by the Participant with the Internal Revenue Service, if the Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to treat any portion of this Award as taxable compensation prior to the time the restrictions are removed from the Shares subject to this Award.
