The Option Rights shall be exercisable cumulatively over the option period only in accordance with the following terms, conditions and provisions:  
  
(i)

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, the Option Rights shall not be exercisable prior to the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, and upon such day the Option Rights shall automatically become vested and exercisable with respect to ___% of the Option Rights.

Such form of written notice is attached hereto. In no event shall the Option Rights be exercisable as to less than 25 Shares at any one time or all of the remaining Shares then subject to the Option Rights, if less than 25.

CANCELLATION OF OPTION RIGHTS. The Committee may cancel any unexercised Option Rights if the Grantee, and while having rights to purchase hereunder, engages in any employment or activity which in any way directly or indirectly, diverts or attempts to divert from the Company any business whatsoever, and which in the opinion of the Committee is contrary to the best interests of the Company.
