For purposes of this Agreement, “cause” shall mean: (a) material default or other material breach by the Executive of the Executive’s obligations hereunder; (b) the willful and habitual failure by the Executive to perform the duties that the Executive is required to perform under this Agreement or the Company’s corporate policies, provided such corporate policies have previously been delivered to the Executive; or (c) misconduct, dishonesty, insubordination, or other act by the Executive that in any way has a direct, substantial and adverse effect on either Company’s reputation or its respective relationships with its customers or employees, including, without limitation, (i) use of alcohol or illegal drugs such as to interfere with the Executive’s obligations hereunder, (ii) conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude or theft, and (iii) material failure by the Executive to comply with applicable laws or governmental regulations pertaining to the Executive’s employment hereunder. 

4.2 Without Cause. Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary contained herein, the Company, may terminate this Agreement without cause by giving ninety (90) days written notice.

The amount payable to the Executive hereunder shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum or as otherwise directed by the Executive. 

4.3 Disability.
