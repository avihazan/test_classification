For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any general meeting of stockholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of shares, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the Company may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period or that a record date be fixed. If the stock transfer books shall be closed for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a general meeting of stockholders, such books shall be closed for at least 10 days but not to exceed, in any case, 60 days immediately preceding such meeting.

In the absence or disability of both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, such meetings shall be presided over by such person as may be chosen by the Board of Directors.

Matters to be acted upon by the Board at any regular or special meeting need not be specified in the notice thereof. 

SECTION 2.4 Action by Directors Without Meeting

When action by the Board of Directors is required or permitted to be taken, action at a meeting may be dispensed with if all commercially reasonable efforts have been taken to notify all the directors and if three fourths of the directors shall consent in writing, by telegram, telefax, electronic mail or other communication device to such action taken or being taken, and provided that all directors are promptly notified of such action taken or having been taken. 

SECTION 2.5 Quorum

A majority of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of any business, and the action of the majority of the directors present in person or by proxy, as hereinafter provided, at a meeting at which a quorum is so present shall constitute the action of the Board of Directors.

Until such general meeting of stockholders is held, the person so designated shall only take such acts of management that can not suffer any delay. If no such general meeting of stockholders shall be called and if no such person shall have been appointed, any person or persons holding, in the aggregate, at least five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company may call a general meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing a Board of Directors.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful. The Company shall indemnify any present or former officer or director of the Company to the fullest extent allowed by the preceding provisions of this Section 5.1 in the event of a “Change of Control”. “Change of Control” means a change in

SECTION 5.2 Indemnification In Actions by or in the Right of the Company  
  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify any current or former, director or officer who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or entity against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been finally adjudged to be liable to the Company for improper conduct unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or any other court having appropriate jurisdiction shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement which the court in which the action or suit was brought or such other court having appropriate jurisdiction shall deem proper. The Company shall indemnify any present or former officer or director of the Company to the fullest extent allowed by the preceding provisions of this Section 5.2 in the event of a Change of Control, as defined in Section 5.1.

extended to current or former employees or agents of the Company only as authorized by the Chief Executive Officer or by contract approved or, or by-laws, resolution or other action adopted or taken, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders. 

SECTION 5.4 Advance of Reimbursement of Expenses and Undertaking

Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a present or former director or a present officer in defending any civil or criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by Article V of these By-Laws. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate. 

SECTION 5.5 Non-Exclusivity of By-Laws

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to the other Sections of this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
