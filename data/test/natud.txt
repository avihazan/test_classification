3\. Rights of a Stockholder. From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Grantee, the Grantee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such shares. If there is any stock dividend, stock split or other change in character or amount of the Restricted Stock, then in such event, any and all new, substituted or additional securities to which Grantee is entitled by reason of the Restricted Stock shall be immediately subject to the Restrictions with the same force and effect as the Restricted Stock subject to such Restrictions immediately before such event. 

4\. Cessation of Service as a Director. 

(a) Forfeiture. If the Grantee’s service as a Director is removed by the Company in accordance with the by-laws or if the Director resigns his position with the Company, then the portion of the Restricted Stock that has not vested shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Grantee nor any of his successors, heirs, assigns, or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such unvested shares of Restricted Stock. 

(b) Accelerated Vesting. If the Director’s service is terminated for any other reason, including, death or Disability, all unvested portions of the Restricted Stock shall immediately vest in full, but the Company shall not be obligated to deliver such portions of the Restricted Stock that are unvested at the time of such termination until the end of the Restricted Period. 

5\. Certificates. Restricted Stock granted herein may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine. If certificates representing Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the Grantee, then the Company may retain physical possession of the certificate until such shares have vested. 

6\. Legends. The Company may require, as a condition of the issuance and delivery of certificates evidencing Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the certificates bear the legend as set forth immediately below, in addition to any other legends required under federal and state securities laws or as otherwise determined by the Committee. All certificates representing any of the shares of Restricted Stock subject to the provisions of this Agreement shall have endorsed thereon the following legend:

HELD BY THE ISSUER OR ITS ASSIGNEES(S) AS SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDER OF THE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY. 

Such legend shall not be removed until such shares vest pursuant to the terms hereof. 

7\. Taxes. The Grantee shall pay to the Company promptly upon request, at the time the Grantee recognizes taxable income in respect to the shares of Restricted Stock, an amount equal to the federal, state and/or local taxes the Company determines it is required to withhold under applicable tax laws with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock. In lieu of collecting payment from the Grantee, the Company may, in its discretion, distribute vested shares of Common Stock net of the number of whole shares of Common Stock the fair market value of which is equal to the minimum amount of federal, state and local taxes required to be withheld under applicable tax laws. The Grantee understands that he (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

8\. Miscellaneous. 

(a) Restrictions on Transfer. Shares of Restricted Stock may not be transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Grantee, including by way of sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or otherwise, except as permitted by the Committee, or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

(b) Compliance with Law and Regulations. The award and any obligation of the Company hereunder shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. Any purported transfer or sale of the shares of Common Stock shall be subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by any applicable state and Federal securities laws. Any transferee shall hold such shares of Common Stock subject to all the provisions hereof and shall acknowledge the same by signing a copy of this Agreement. 

(c) Invalid Transfers. No purported sale, assignment, mortgage, hypothecation, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, gift, transfer in trust (voting or other) or other disposition of, or creation of a security interest in or lien on, any of the shares of Restricted Stock by any holder thereof in violation of the provisions of this Restricted Stock Agreement shall be valid, and the Company will not transfer any of said shares of Restricted Stock on its books or otherwise nor will any of said shares of Restricted Stock be entitled to vote, nor will any dividends be paid thereon, unless and until there has been full compliance with said provisions to the satisfaction of the Company. The foregoing restrictions are in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies, legal or equitable, available to enforce said provisions.
