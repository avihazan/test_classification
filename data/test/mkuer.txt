* * *

##### 

e. the Employee may terminate the Employment Period in the event of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company that occurs more than sixty days prior to the expiration of a term or within six months after the Change in Control, and that results in a reduction in compensation or a material change in duties, title, or transfer to a location greater than seventy five miles from the Employee’s residence, during the term of this Agreement by delivering written notice to the Company in accordance with Section 20, and the Employment Period shall terminate upon delivery,; in which case Employee shall be entitled to receive as severance an amount equal to nine (9) months of Employee’s then current base salary and minimum bonus as defined in Attachment A, if applicable (less all applicable and required federal, state, local and authorized deductions), to be paid pursuant to Company’s regular payroll schedule; or

f. the Company may terminate the Employment Period with Cause by delivering written notice to the Employee in accordance with Section 20, and the Employment Period shall terminate upon delivery. For purposes of this Section 8 “Cause” shall mean: (a) Employee’s embezzlement, willful breach of fiduciary duty or fraud with regard to the Company or any of the Company’s assets or businesses, (b) Employee’s conviction of, or pleading of guilty or nolo contendere, with regard to a felony (other than a traffic violation) or to any other crime involving moral turpitude or involving activity related to the affairs of the Company, or (c) any other willful (and if, the breach relates to performance of his duties, continued) breach by Employee of a material provision of this Agreement that, if capable of being cured, remains uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given to Employee. If the breach is not curable, the Company may terminate without notice. In the event the Company terminates the Employment Period for Cause, the Company’s sole obligation is to pay Employee for that period actually worked by Employee, subject to any direct financial loss to the Company resulting from Employee’s breach.

For the purpose of this Agreement “Good Reason” shall mean a reduction in Employee’s compensation or the assignment to the Employee of any duties inconsistent in any material respect with the Employee’s position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4 of this Agreement, or any other action by Employer which results in a material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by Employer promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Employee or relocation of Employee’s principle place of employment to a location more than seventy-five miles from Employee’s residence.

For the purpose of this Agreement a “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if:

(A) any “person” (as defined in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), excluding for this purpose the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of such plan which acquires beneficial ownership of voting securities of the Company, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) directly or indirectly of securities of the Company representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; 

* * *

##### 

(i) provided, however, that no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as the result of an acquisition of securities of the Company by the Company which, by reducing the number of voting securities outstanding, increases the direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest of any person to thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities, but any subsequent increase in the direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest of such a person in the Company shall be deemed a Change in Control;

(ii) and provided further, however, that if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a person who has become the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of securities of the Company representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities has inadvertently reached that level of ownership interest, and if such person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient amount of securities of the Company so that the person no longer has a direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest in thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities, then no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred; or

(B) during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including any period prior to the Effective Date), individuals who at the beginning of such two-year period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (except for a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described elsewhere in this definition) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; or 

(C) the shareholders of the Company approve: 

a. a plan of complete liquidation of the Company, 

b. an agreement for the sale or disposition of the Company or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, 

c. any plan of merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, except that shareholder approval of a plan of merger or consolidation in which the security owners of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation continue to own at least seventy percent (70%) of the voting securities of the new (or continued) entity immediately after such merger or consolidation shall not be Change in Control. 

9. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. Employee recognizes and acknowledges that Company’s trade secrets, customer/client lists, strategic plans, marketing plans, private processes, prospective customer/client lists, and staff and prospective staff lists are deemed to be the private and proprietary information of Company and are available, special, unique and significant proprietary assets of Company’s business. Employee will not either during or subsequent to the Employment Period, in whole or in part, disclose such trade secrets, customer/client lists, strategic plans, marketing plans, staff or prospective staff lists, prospective customer/client lists or private processes to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever unless specifically authorized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Employee shall not make use of any of the above for Employee’s own purposes or for

The provisions of this Section 10 shall be construed as an Agreement independent of any other provision contained herein and shall be enforceable in both Law and Equity, including by temporary or permanent Restraining Orders, notwithstanding the existence of any claim or cause of action by Employee against Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company terminates Employee’s employment for convenience hereunder, Company agrees that Employee may upon the termination of the Employment Period, perform services within the information technology industry, provided however that Employee does not compete with Company, (a) by soliciting directly or indirectly any Company employees, and/or (b) by soliciting directly or indirectly any new business from Company’s then existing customers or Prospective Customers, during the Restrictive Period. “Prospective Customer” means any entity that the Company is, or has been within the twelve (12) months prior to Employee’s termination, in the process of soliciting, negotiating with, or otherwise communicating with, for the purpose of providing goods or services.
