Exhibit B 

Post Emergence Annual Bonus. Upon emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection, the Executive shall be entitled to incentive compensation directly related to the actual Eddie Bauer Earnings Before Taxes (EBT) growth achieved using pre and post emergence EBT for the calendar year. The incentive will be calculated as a percentage of the targeted minimum EBT improvement over the previous year with the opportunity for additional incentive based upon incremental EBT growth over the target. The incentive payout for the year of emergence will be pro-rated for the number of months post emergence in that year. 

The Executive’s 2004 incentive will be payable only upon a minimum of an $18M improvement in EBT over pre and post petition 2003 EBT earnings. If the minimum EBT improvement is achieved the executive will be eligible for a payment equal to 5% of the $18M gain achieved or $900,000. Performance in excess of the $18M gain but less than the 2004 target is rewarded at 5%. Upon achieving performance in excess of the 2004 EBT target the Executive will be eligible for a payout equal to 10% of the incremental growth achieved. The incentive earned on the incremental growth is not capped. 

The 2005 incentive program continues to reward sustained EBT growth. Eligibility is contingent upon Eddie Bauer achieving a minimum improvement of $25M over 2004 performance. Upon achieving a minimum improvement of $25M, the Executive will receive a payout equal to 5% of the minimum improvement EBT gain or $1,250,000. Performance in excess of the $25M gain but less than the 2005 target is rewarded at 5%. Upon achieving performance in excess of the 2005 EBT target the Executive will be eligible for a payout equal to 10% of the incremental growth achieved. The incentive earned on the incremental growth is not capped.
