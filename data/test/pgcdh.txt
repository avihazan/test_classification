Pursuant to the Fiserv, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Fiserv, Inc. (the “Company”) has granted to you an Option, the terms and conditions of which are set out below and in the Plan. Any capitalized term used in this Stock Option Agreement (this “Agreement”) without definition has the meaning set forth in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern. 

1. Date of Grant; Type of Option. The Option is granted to you on the date set forth above (the “Grant Date”). As a “non-qualified stock option,” the Option will not be treated by you or the Company as an “incentive stock option,” as defined in Section 422 of the Code.   
  
2. Termination of Option. Your right to exercise the Option (and to purchase the Shares subject to the Option (the “Option Shares”)) shall expire and terminate in all events on the earlier of (a) the close of business on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date or (b) the date upon which exercise is no longer permitted as provided in Section 7 hereof.   
  
3. Option Price. The purchase price to be paid upon the exercise of the Option is the exercise price per Option Share set forth above.   
  
4. Provisions Relating to Exercise.  
  
(a) The Option vests and becomes exercisable with respect to 20% of the Option Shares on the Grant Date and with respect to an additional 20% of the Option Shares on each anniversary of the Grant Date until the Option is fully vested and exercisable.   
  
(b) Once you become entitled to exercise any part of the Option (and to purchase Option Shares) as provided in Section 4(a) hereof, that right will continue until the date on which the Option expires and terminates pursuant to Section 2 hereof. The right to purchase Option Shares under the Option is cumulative, so that if the full number of Option Shares purchasable in a period is not purchased, the balance may be purchased at any time or from time to time thereafter during the term of the Option.

of your estate, any person who shall have acquired the Option through bequest or inheritance or such guardian ad litem, administrator or other legal representative is) entitled to exercise the Option per the terms contained herein within one year after you cease to be a full-time employee. Otherwise, you are (or such guardian ad litem, administrator or other legal representative is) entitled to exercise the Option per the terms contained herein within 30 days after you cease to be a full-time employee.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your employment is terminated for Cause, the Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall terminate immediately. In addition, if your employment is terminated other than for Cause but the Administrator later determines that it could have been terminated for Cause if all facts had been known at the time it was terminated, the Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, will terminate immediately on the date of such determination. For the sake of clarity, in the event that your employment was terminated for Cause, there shall be no acceleration of vesting or exercisability under Section 7(a).   
  
(d) If a Change of Control of the Company occurs, the provisions of Section 17(c) of the Plan shall apply to the Option. If the successor or purchaser in the Change of Control has assumed the Company’s obligations with respect to the Option or provided a substitute award as contemplated by Section 17(c)(i) of the Plan and within 12 months following the occurrence of the Change of Control you are terminated without Cause or you terminate your employment for Good Reason (as hereinafter defined), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7(c) of this Agreement, the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable with respect to all Option Shares covered by the Option as of the time immediately prior to such termination of employment and notwithstanding any other provision hereof (except Section 7(b)), the Option shall become exercisable by you for 30 days following such termination (or such longer period as is otherwise specified in Section 7(a)) and the provisions of Section 5 shall cease immediately to apply. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means your suffering any of the following events without your consent: (i) significant or material lessening of your responsibilities; (ii) a reduction in your annual base salary or a material reduction in the level of incentive compensation for which you have been eligible during the two years immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control and/or a material adverse change in the conditions governing receipt of such incentive compensation from those that prevailed prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control; or (iii) the Company’s requiring you to be based anywhere other than within 50 miles of your place of employment at the time of the occurrence of the Change of Control, except for reasonably required travel to an extent substantially consistent with your business travel obligations.
