9\. Change in Control. 

(a) In the event (i) the Company merges into or consolidates with another entity, or is subject in any way to a transfer of a substantial amount of its assets, resulting in the assets, business or operations of the Company being controlled by an entity or individual other than the Company (a “Change of Ownership”), or there occurs any “Change in Control” (as defined below) of the Company, and (ii) there is a significant change in the nature and scope of the duties and powers of the Executive, as outlined in paragraph 3, or the Executive reasonably determines that, as a result of the occurrence of one or more of the events described in subparagraph 9(a)(i), he is unable to exercise or perform the powers, functions or duties as set forth in this Agreement or the Executive has “good reason” to terminate, as that term is defined in subparagraph 9(c), then the Executive shall be entitled, upon giving thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Company, to terminate this Agreement and shall within 90 days after the effective date of such termination, receive a lump sum amount equal to his base salary for twelve (12) months at the rate in effect on the date such notice is given to the Company. The Executive shall also be entitled to any Bonus payable to the Executive in accordance with paragraph 5. In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to any money earned by the Executive under any Company long-term incentive plan which would have become available following the date of termination of this Agreement by the Executive. 

(b) A “Change in Control” shall be deemed to have taken place if (i) a third person, including a group of individuals or entities, becomes the beneficial owner of shares of the Company having fifty (50%) percent or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of Directors of the Company, or (ii) as a result of, or in connection with any cash tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, or sale of assets, or any combination of the foregoing events, the persons who are directors of the Company before the occurrence of such event or events cease to constitute twenty-five (25%) percent of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

(c) For purposes of paragraph 9(a)(ii) the Executive shall be deemed to have “good reason” to terminate his employment with the Company pursuant to paragraph 9(a)(ii) if any of the following events occurs without the Executive’s express written consent:

(2) A material change in the Executive’s reporting responsibilities, titles or offices as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or Change of Ownership, or any removal of the Executive from or any failure to re-elect the Executive to such office, unless such removal or failure to elect is for cause.

(4) A failure by the Company to continue any incentive programs for executives applicable to the Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control or Change of Ownership, the effect of which failure would be to materially reduce the incentive compensation which would be payable to the Executive but for discontinuance of such programs.

(5) The Executive is requested without his consent to relocate his office to a location more than One Hundred (100) miles from its location immediately prior to the Change in Control or Change in Ownership. 

(6) the event the Executive consents to any relocation of his office and such relocation necessitates the Executive moving from his then current residence (the “Prior Residence”), the failure by the Company to pay or reimburse the Executive for all reasonable moving expenses incurred with respect to a new residence (“New Residence”) and to indemnify the Executive against any relocation loss incurred by the Executive in relocating to his New Residence which loss shall be the amount, if any, by which the actual sales price of the Prior Residence is exceeded by the higher of the Executive’s aggregate investment in the Prior Residence or the fair market value of the Prior Residence as established by an independent appraiser designated by the Executive and acceptable to the Corporation. 

(7) Failure of the Company to continue in effect any benefit or compensation plan or arrangement in which the Executive was participating immediately preceding the Change in Control or Change of Ownership, or the taking of any action by the Company not required by law which would adversely affect the Executive’s participation in or materially reduce Executive’s benefits from such a plan. 

10\. Termination Payment Maximum. If any payments under this Agreement, when aggregated with any other Company payments to the Executive from other policies, plans and agreements of the Company that are deemed to constitute “golden parachute” payments (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) (“Code”), exceed the maximum amount of golden parachute compensation under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code that may be paid without tax penalties to the Executive and the loss or partial loss of the compensation tax deduction to the Company, then the Executive shall specify which of his payments shall be reduced until his aggregate golden parachute compensation reaches the highest amount permissible without triggering tax penalties to the Executive and the loss or partial loss of the compensation tax deduction to the Company under Code Sections 280G and 4999; provided, however, that when the Executive designates which of his Company golden parachute payments shall be reduced to meet the limitations under Code Sections 280G and 4999, no change in the timing of the payments shall be made without the consent of the Company. 

11\. Post-Termination Obligations. The Company and the Executive covenant and agree: 

(a) That the Executive shall not, for the twelve (12) months following the date of termination of this Agreement, either directly or indirectly as an agent, employee, consultant, investor or owner, unless acting with the prior written consent of the Board of Directors, associate himself with any other entity which directly competes with the Company, nor will the Executive divert or attempt to divert from the Company any business whatsoever by influencing or attempting to influence any customers of the Company within any jurisdiction within which the Company or any subsidiary thereof provides clinical decision support or service, or within any county contiguous thereto;

##### 

(b) That a breach of the obligations imposed on the Executive in this paragraph 11 regarding competition with the Company may not be one which is capable of being easily measured by monetary damages. Consequently, the Executive specifically agrees that this paragraph 11 may be enforced by injunctive relief. Further, the Executive specifically agrees that, in addition to such injunctive relief, and not in lieu of it, the Company may also bring suit for damages if such is incurred by the Company as a result of a breach of the Executive’s obligations under this paragraph 11; and, 

(c) That in the event a court of competent jurisdiction finds any of the provisions of this paragraph to be so overbroad as to be unenforceable, it is the parties’ intention that such provision be reduced in scope by the court, but only to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render the provision reasonable and enforceable, keeping in mind that it is the Executive’s intention to give the Company the broadest possible protection against harmful future competition. 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall be permitted to continue or expand his not-for-profit endeavors on behalf of the Robertson Research Institute without being found in violation of this paragraph 11. 

12\. Settlement of Controversy and Expenses. 

(a) Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in Michigan in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The arbitrator shall be chosen mutually by the parties and shall not have jurisdiction or authority to change, add to or subtract from any of the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitration decision shall be final and binding and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. 

(b) In the event proceedings are brought to enforce any provision in this Agreement and the Executive prevails, then he shall be entitled to recover from the Company his reasonable costs and expenses of the proceeding, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and what would otherwise be the Executive’s portion of the costs of arbitration. If the Company prevails, then each party shall be responsible for his/its respective costs, expenses and attorneys fees and the costs of arbitration shall be equally divided. In the event it is determined that the Executive is entitled to compensation, legal fees and expenses hereunder, he also shall be entitled to interest thereon, payable to him at the prime rate of interest of 7% per annum, as in effect from time to time during the period from the date such amounts should have been paid to the date of actual payment. For purposes of determining the date when legal fees and expenses are payable, such amounts shall not be due until 30 days after notification to the Company of such amounts.
