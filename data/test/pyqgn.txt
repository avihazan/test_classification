ANNEX A

TO

THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION

2009 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

Further Terms and Conditions of Award. It is understood and agreed that the Award of RSUs evidenced by the RSU Award Agreement to which this is annexed is subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

1. Tax Withholding. With respect to the minimum statutory tax withholding required upon the lapse of restrictions on the RSUs, the Participant may elect to satisfy such withholding requirements by tender of previously acquired shares of Stock or by having the Company withhold shares of Stock upon the Conversion Date in accordance with Article 16 of the Plan.

2\. Termination of Employment. Upon the Participant’s Termination of Employment (as defined in the Plan), all RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction shall be treated as follows:

(A) If the Participant’s Termination of Employment is on account of death or Disability, then all RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction shall immediately become nonforfeitable and the restrictions with respect to the RSUs shall lapse as of the date of such Termination of Employment.

(B) If the Participant’s Termination of Employment is on account of Retirement at the Normal Retirement Date,

(i) any RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction granted more than twelve (12) months prior to the Normal Retirement Date, and

(ii) a prorated portion of any RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction granted within twelve (12) months of the Normal Retirement Date (such proration to be determined by multiplying the Number of RSUs Granted by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Participant was employed since the Date of Grant and the denominator of which is 365)

will remain subject to the Period of Restriction set forth on the first page of this RSU Award Agreement. The remaining portion of the RSUs that do not remain subject to the Period of Restriction shall be forfeited.

(C) If the Participant’s Termination of Employment is on account of Retirement at the Normal Retirement Date and if the Participant dies after such Termination of Employment but before the end of the Period of Restriction, then the restrictions with respect to all RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction pursuant to subsection 2(B) shall be deemed to have lapsed as of the date of death.

(D) If the Termination of Employment occurs during the Post-Change Period and

(i) the Participant’s Termination of Employment is initiated by the Employer

1

other than for Cause, death, or Disability, or

(ii) the Participant is eligible to participate in The Allstate Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan (the “CIC Plan”) and the Participant’s Termination of Employment is initiated by the Participant for Good Reason,

all RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction shall immediately become nonforfeitable and the restrictions with respect to the RSUs shall lapse as of the date of such Termination of Employment.

(E) If the Participant’s Termination of Employment is on account of any other reason, then all RSUs that remain subject to the Period of Restriction shall be forfeited as of the end of the day of such Termination of Employment.

3\. Conversion Date. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, a Participant shall be entitled to delivery of shares of Stock that underlie the RSUs then outstanding on the day following the date the restrictions lapse with respect to such RSU.

4\. Dividend Equivalent Right. Each RSU entitles a Participant to receive a cash amount (less applicable withholding) equal to the sum of all regular dividend payments as would have been made in respect of each share of Stock underlying such RSUs if the Participant were the holder of such shares during the period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on the day prior to the Conversion Date. The dividend equivalent payments will accrue during such period and will be paid within 30 days of the Conversion Date of such RSUs.

Dividend equivalent accruals shall be made only with respect to such RSUs that were outstanding on the applicable dividend record date.

5\. Ratification of Actions. By accepting the RSU Award or other benefit under the Plan, the Participant and each person claiming under or through him shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated the Participant’s acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan or the RSU Award by the Company, the Board, or the Compensation and Succession Committee.

6\. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company shall be addressed to its Stock Option Record Office and any notice hereunder to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at his or her most recent home address on file with the Company, subject to the right of either party to designate at any time hereafter in writing some other address.

7\. Governing Law and Severability. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the RSU Award Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. In the event any provision of this RSU Award Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this RSU Award Agreement, and this RSU Award Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

8\. Definitions. In addition to the following definitions, capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given them in the Plan.

Participant’s Termination of Employment for actions which would constitute conduct leading to immediate termination pursuant to Company policy. If a Participant is a participant in the CIC Plan, “Cause” means “Cause” as that term is defined in the CIC Plan on the Date of Grant.

“Change in Control” means, except as otherwise provided at the end of this definition, the occurrence of any one or more of the following:

(a) (Voting Power) any Person or group (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B)), other than a Subsidiary or any employee benefit plan (or any related trust) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, acquires or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person or Persons, ownership of stock of the Company possessing 30% or more of the combined voting power of all Voting Securities of the Company (such a Person or group that is not a Similarly Owned Company (as defined below), a “More than 30% Owner”), except that no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of such ownership by a corporation with respect to which both more than 70% of the common stock of such corporation and Voting Securities representing more than 70% of the combined voting power of the Voting Securities of such corporation are then owned, directly or indirectly, by the Persons who were the direct or indirect owners of the common stock and Voting Securities of the Company immediately before such acquisition in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately before such acquisition, of the common stock and Voting Securities of the Company, as the case may be (a “Similarly Owned Company”); or

“CIC Plan” – see subsection 2(D).

“Good Reason” means “Good Reason” as that term is defined in the CIC Plan on the Date of Grant.
