II. AGREEMENT

A. Grant of Restricted Stock. The Corporation hereby grants Shares of Restricted Stock to the Grantee for the number of Shares set forth above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary anywhere else in this Agreement, the Shares of Restricted Stock in this Award are subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference.

1. Restrictions on Transfer. The Shares of Restricted Stock are restricted from transfer until the restrictions lapse. Subject to the Grantee's termination of services, as described in Section 4, below, the Shares of Restricted Stock vest, and all restrictions lapse, on August 5, 2012. Upon vesting and the lapse of the restrictions, the associated Shares become freely transferable if the Grantee is still a Service Provider on that date. The Restricted Shares subject to the Award will be forfeited if the Grantee terminates his or her services with the Corporation or a Subsidiary prior to vesting and the lapse of restrictions, except as designated otherwise in this Agreement.

2. Rights as Stockholder. Except for the potential forfeitability of the Shares before the lapse of restrictions set forth in Section 1 above, the Grantee has all rights of a stockholder (including voting and dividend rights) commencing on the date of the Corporation's book entry evidencing the grant of Restricted Stock.

3. Adjustments.  In the event of any stock dividend, reclassification, subdivision or combination, or similar transaction affecting the Shares of Restricted Stock covered by this Award, the rights of the Grantee will be adjusted as provided in Article X of the Plan.

4. Termination of Services. The Shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Award will be forfeited if the Grantee terminates his or her services with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or if the Grantee's services are terminated by the Corporation for any reason before the Shares of Restricted Stock vest and the restrictions lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shares of Restricted Stock vest and the restrictions on transfer will lapse upon the death or Disability (as defined in the Plan) of the Grantee with respect to 100% of the Shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement. Upon the lapse of the transfer restrictions, the Shares of Restricted Stock are fully transferable.

B. Other Terms and Conditions.

1. Non-Transferability of Award. Except as described below, this Award and the Restricted Shares subject to the Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by laws of descent or distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with the consent of the Administrator, the Grantee may assign or transfer the Award and its underlying Restricted Shares to a Permitted Assignee, provided the Permitted Assignee is bound by and subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, and the Permitted Assignee executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation evidencing these obligations. The terms of this Award are binding on the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Grantee.

2. Other Restrictions on Share Issuance. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation's obligation to deliver Shares under this Award is subject to its compliance with federal and state laws, rules and regulations applying to the authorization, issuance or sale of securities as the Corporation deems necessary or advisable. The Corporation is not required to deliver Shares under this Agreement unless and until it receives satisfactory proof that the issuance or transfer of the Shares does not violate any of the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, or the provisions of any state law governing the sale of securities or any stock exchange on which the Corporation's Shares may be listed, and that there has been compliance with the provisions of these acts, rules, regulations and state laws. 

3. Withholding. Grantee agrees to tender sufficient funds to satisfy any applicable income and employment tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of and the lapse of restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock under the Award. Alternatively, Grantee may request the Corporation to sell a number of Shares sufficient to satisfy any tax liabilities.

4. Dispute Resolution. Grantee and the Corporation agree that any disagreement, dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation, validity, or the alleged breach thereof, will be settled exclusively and, consistent with the procedures specified in this Section, irrespective of its magnitude, the amount in controversy, or the nature of the relief sought. 

(a)Negotiation. In the event of any dispute, controversy, claim, question or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the Grantee and the Corporation will use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question or disagreement. To this effect, they will consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. 

(b)Arbitration. If the Grantee and the Corporation do not reach a solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then, upon written notice by the Grantee to the Corporation or the Corporation to the Grantee, all disputes, claims, questions, controversies, or differences will be submitted to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Employment Arbitration Rules (the “Arbitration Rules”). 

(1) Arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator skilled in the arbitration of executive employment matters. The parties to the arbitration will jointly appoint the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after initiation of the arbitration. If the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator as provided above, an arbitrator with substantial experience in executive employment matters will be appointed by the AAA as provided in the Arbitration Rules. The Corporation will pay all of the fees, if any, and expenses of the arbitrator and the arbitration, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator. Each party to the arbitration is responsible for his/its respective attorneys fees or other costs of representation. 

(2) Location. The arbitration will be conducted in Oakland County, Michigan.

(3) Procedure. At any oral hearing of evidence in connection with the arbitration, each party or its legal counsel will have the right to examine its witnesses and cross-examine the witnesses of any opposing party. No evidence of any witness may be presented in any form unless the opposing party or parties has the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, except under extraordinary circumstances in which the arbitrator determines that the interests of justice require a different procedure.

(4) Decision. Any decision or award of the arbitrator is final and binding on the parties to the arbitration proceeding. The parties agree that the arbitration award may be enforced against the parties to the arbitration proceeding or their assets wherever they may be found and that a judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(5) Power. Nothing contained in this Agreement may be deemed to give the arbitrator any authority, power, or right to alter, change, amend, modify, add to, or subtract from any of the provisions of this Agreement.

The provisions of this Section survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, are binding on the Corporation's and Grantee's respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, designated beneficiaries and any other person asserting a claim described above, and may not be modified without the consent of the Corporation. To the extent arbitration is required, no person asserting a claim has the right to resort to any federal, state or local court or administrative agency concerning the claim unless expressly provided by federal statute, and the decision of the arbitrator is a complete defense to any action or proceeding instituted in any tribunal or agency with respect to any dispute, unless precluded by federal statute.
