* * *

  


(b) To insure the availability for delivery of the Participant’s Unvested Shares in the event of forfeiture of such Shares by the Participant pursuant to Section 3, the Participant hereby appoints the secretary, or any other person designated by the Board as escrow agent, as its attorney-in-fact to assign and transfer unto the Company, any Unvested Shares forfeited by the Participant pursuant to Section 3 and shall, upon execution of this Agreement, deliver and deposit with the secretary of the Company, or such other person designated by the Board, the share certificate or certificates representing the Unvested Shares, together with the stock assignment duly endorsed in blank, attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Unvested Shares and stock assignment shall be held by the secretary in escrow, pursuant to the Joint Escrow Instructions of the Company and the Participant attached as Exhibit B hereto, until (i) the Shares are forfeited by the Participant as provided in Section 3, (ii) such Unvested Shares vest or (iii) until such time as this Agreement no longer is in effect. Upon vesting of the Unvested Shares, the escrow agent shall deliver to the Participant the certificate or certificates representing such Shares in the escrow agent’s possession belonging to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Joint Escrow Instructions and the escrow agent shall be discharged of all further obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the escrow agent shall nevertheless retain such certificate or certificates as escrow agent if so required pursuant to other restrictions imposed pursuant to this Agreement.

  


(c) The Company, or its designee, shall not be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to holding the Shares in escrow and while acting in good faith.

“THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE STOCKHOLDER, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY.”

  


7\. Adjustment for Stock Split. All references to the number of Shares in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split or stock dividend or other similar change in the Shares which may be made by the Company after the date of this Agreement.

  


8\. Tax Issues. 

  


(a) Section 83(b) Election. The Participant may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to this award. Section 83 of the Code provides that generally the Participant is not subject to federal income tax until Shares are released from the Forfeiture Restriction. If the Participant makes a Section 83(b) election, the Participant would recognize income as of the date 

  


3

  


* * *

  


of the award in the amount of the excess of the Fair Market Value of the award (determined as of the date of the award) over the Purchase Price. A Section 83(b) election must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Date of Grant. The form for making a Section 83(b) election is attached as Exhibit C. The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant’s sole responsibility to timely file the Section 83(b) election and that failure to file a Section 83(b) election within the applicable thirty (30) day period will cause the Participant to be taxed when the shares are released from the Forfeiture Restriction. 

(b) If the Recipient does not file a Section 83(b) election after the grant of the Shares, at such time as the shares of Restricted Stock are released from the Forfeiture Restriction, the Recipient (or his/her personal representative) shall deliver to the Company, within ten (10) days after the occurrence of such release (or in the event of death, within ten (10) days of the appointment of the personal representative), either a check payable to the Company in the amount of all withholding tax obligations (whether federal, state, local or foreign income or social insurance tax), imposed on the Recipient and the Company by reason of the release of the Forfeiture Restriction, or a withholding election form to be provided by the Company upon request by the Recipient (or personal representative).

(c) In the event the Recipient or his personal representative elects to satisfy the withholding obligation by executing the withholding election form, the Recipient’s actual number of vested shares of Restricted Stock shall be reduced by the smallest number of whole shares which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date that the Forfeiture Restriction is released, is sufficient to satisfy the amount of the withholding tax obligations imposed on the Company by reason of the Recipient being recorded as the stockholder of record of such Shares. In the event that the Recipient fails to tender either the required certified check or withholding election, the Recipient shall be deemed to have elected and executed the withholding election form.

9\. Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation.

(a) In consideration of the Shares, the Participant agrees and covenants not to: 

(i) Contribute his or her knowledge, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, as an employee, officer, owner, manager, advisor, consultant, agent, partner, director, shareholder, volunteer, intern or in any other similar capacity to an entity engaged in the same or similar business as the Company and its Related Entities, as such business may be expanded from time to time, for a period of 2 years following the Participant's termination of employment, provided that nothing in this Section 9 shall prohibit the ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the stock of a publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or listed with the Nasdaq Stock Market; 

(ii) Directly or indirectly, solicit, hire, recruit, attempt to hire or recruit, or induce the termination of employment of any employee of the Company or its Related Entities for 2 years following the Participant's termination of employment; or

(iii) Directly or indirectly, solicit, contact (including, but not limited to, e-mail, regular mail, express mail, telephone, fax, and instant message), attempt to contact

* * *

  


or meet with the current, former, or prospective customers of the Company or any of its Related Entities for purposes of offering or accepting goods or services similar to or competitive with those offered by the Company or any of its Related Entities for a period of 2 years following the Participant's termination of employment.

(b) If the Participant breaches any of the covenants set forth in Section 9(a):

(i) All Unvested Shares shall be immediately forfeited; and

(ii) the Participant hereby consents and agrees that the Company shall be entitled to seek, in addition to other available remedies, a temporary or permanent injunction or other equitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing any actual damages or that money damages would not afford an adequate remedy, and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security. The aforementioned equitable relief shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, legal remedies, monetary damages or other available forms of relief.

(c) If the Participant has agreed to a non-compete and/or a non-solicitation provision in any other contract or agreement with the Company, then the Company may choose to enforce any other non-compete and/or non-solicitation provision to which the Participant is bound to the extent such provision provides greater restrictions than those provided in Sections 9(a) and 9(b) herein. 

  


10\. General Provisions.

  


(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the issuance of the Shares to the Participant and may only be modified or amended in a writing signed by Participant and the Company.

  


(b) This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the Company and the Participant concerning the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement between the Company and the Participant concerning the subject matter hereof is hereby terminated and superseded by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Participant except as required in connection with a permitted transfer thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. Any attempted transfer of this Agreement not in compliance with the terms hereof shall be null and void.

  


(c) Either party’s failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party’s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.
