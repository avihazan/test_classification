(a)

The Company and Employee acknowledge and agree that for Employee to compete with the Company during the Employment Term and for a limited time after the end of the Employment Term would be contrary to the purposes for which the parties entered into this Agreement.

(i)

for a period of two (2) years from the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company (the “Covenant Period”), be employed by, engage in or carry on any business or undertaking which competes with the Protected Parties in the Business, or those aspects of the Business involved in the specific area of cholesterol regulation and anti-inflammatory agents unique to the Company and protected by its patents or patent applications, in the State of Michigan and in any other State in which the Protected Parties conduct the Business or take active steps to conduct the Business during the Employment Term (the “Area of Non-Competition”);

  


(ii)

during the Covenant Period, have any interest in, assist in any manner or in any capacity, make any loan to, or be associated with (whether as a shareholder, partner, member, associate, owner, employee, independent contractor, consultant, agent or otherwise) any Person which is deemed to be engaged in the specific aspects of the Business as they relate to cholesterol regulation and anti-inflammatory agents unique to the Company and protected by its patents or patent applications, in each case as then currently conducted, anywhere within the Area of Non-Competition; provided, however, that Employee may invest in any publicly-held entity engaged in the Business if his aggregate investment does not exceed 1% in value of the issued and outstanding voting securities of such entity;

The parties intend that the covenants set forth in Section 9 above shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each and every political subdivision of each state, province and county in the Area of Non-Competition. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in Section 9 above are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If any court determines that any covenant set forth in Section 9 above, or any portion of any such covenant, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the covenants set forth in Section 9 above shall not be affected and shall be given full force and effect, without regard to the invalid covenant or the invalid portion. If any court determines that any covenant set forth in Section 9 above, or any portion of any such covenant, is unenforceable because of its duration or geographic scope, such court shall have the power to reduce such duration or scope, as the case may be, and enforce such covenant or portion in such reduced form. The parties intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the covenants set forth in Section 9 above upon the courts of any jurisdiction in which Employee is alleged to have committed an act in violation of any of the covenants contained here. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the covenants set forth in Section 9 above, or any portion of such covenants, unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of the parties that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of the Company to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions.

  


(c)

In the event of a breach or attempted breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 9, Section 10 or Section 11 below, in addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies immediately available, such covenants may be enforced by a temporary and/or permanent injunction to secure the specific performance of such covenants, and to prevent a breach or contemplated breach of such covenants, without the need to post any bond or other security of any kind. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 9, Section 10 or Section 11 below, would be inadequate. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are intended to be and are in addition to any other remedies available to the Company, either at law or in equity. In addition, Employee agrees that, in the event of a breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 9, Section 10 or Section 11 below, by Employee, he shall be liable, and shall reimburse the Company, for all fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other professional fees) arising out of or in any way related to the enforcement of this Covenant. The Company agrees that in the event of a dispute or breach in which the Employee prevails, the Company shall be liable, and shall reimburse the Employee, for all fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other professional fees) arising out of or in any way related to the enforcement of this Covenant.

Employee agrees that all such Inventions are the sole and exclusive property of the Company. EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT ANY PARTICIPATION BY HIM IN THE DESIGN, DISCOVERY, CONCEPTION, PRODUCTION, PERFECTION, DEVELOPMENT OR IMPROVEMENT OF AN INVENTION IS WORK MADE FOR HIRE, AS DEFINED IN TITLE 17, UNITED STATES CODE, FOR THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEE HEREBY ASSIGNS TO THE COMPANY ALL OF HIS RIGHTS IN AND TO SUCH INVENTIONS.

If the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Employee’s signature on any document needed to vest in the Company all right, title and interest in and to any Inventions, whether because of Employee’s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in Employee’s behalf and stead to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and enforcement of patents, copyrights or similar protections with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Employee.

Employee further agrees that he shall not utilize or make available any Confidential Information, either directly or indirectly, in connection with his solicitation of employment or acceptance of employment with any third party. Employee further agrees that he will promptly return (or destroy if it cannot be returned) to Company all written or other tangible evidence of any Confidential Information and any memoranda with respect thereto which are in his possession or under his control upon Company’s request for the return of such items. Notwithstanding this Section 11, Employee may disclose Confidential Information if required (and then only to the extent required) by applicable law; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, Employee must provide the Company with written notice of such pending disclosure, sufficiently in advance thereof so as to allow the Company a reasonable opportunity to contest such required disclosure.

  


For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall include all proprietary information related to the Business, including, but not limited to, processes, ideas, techniques, Inventions, methods, products, services, research, purchasing, marketing, selling, customers, suppliers or trade secrets.

Miscellaneous.

  


(a)
