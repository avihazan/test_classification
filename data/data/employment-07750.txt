8\. 

Confidentiality.  
  
a. 

Consequences of Entrustment with Sensitive Information. Executive recognizes that his position with Company requires considerable responsibility and trust. Relying on Executive’s responsibilities hereunder and undivided loyalty, Company expects to entrust Executive with highly sensitive confidential, restricted, and proprietary information involving Trade Secrets and other intellectual property. Executive should recognize that it could prove very difficult to isolate these Trade Secrets from business activities that Executive might consider pursuing after termination of employment, and in some instances, Executive may not be able to compete with Company in certain ways because of the risk that Company's Trade Secrets might be compromised. Executive is responsible for protecting and preserving Company's proprietary rights for use only for Company's benefit, and these responsibilities may impose unavoidable limitations on Executive’s ability to pursue some kinds of business opportunities that might interest Executive during or after his employment.  
  
b. 

Restrictions on Use and Disclosure of Trade Secrets. Executive agrees not to use or disclose any Trade Secrets of Company during his employment and for so long afterwards as the pertinent information or data remain Trade Secrets, whether or not the Trade Secrets are in written or tangible form, except as required to perform any duties for Company.  
  
c. 

Screening of Public Releases of Information. In addition, and without any intention of limiting Executive’s other obligations under this Agreement in any way, Executive shall not, during his employment, reveal any nonpublic information concerning the technology pertaining to the proprietary products and manufacturing processes of Company (particularly technology under current development or improvement), unless Executive has obtained approval from Company in advance. In that connection, Executive shall submit to Company for review any proposed scientific and technical articles and the text of any public speeches relating to work done for Company before they are released or delivered. Company has the right to disapprove and prohibit, or delete any parts of, such articles or speeches that might disclose Company's Trade Secrets or Confidential Information or otherwise be contrary to Company's business interests.

This obligation applies to all materials made or compiled by Executive, as well as to all materials furnished to Executive by anyone else in connection with employment hereunder.  
  
10\. 

Benefit. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns but the obligations of the Executive hereunder may not be assigned by the Executive and are personal to her. The Executive agrees that the Company may arrange for his employment through an employee-leasing firm provided that his rights hereunder are not materially reduced.  
  
11\. 

Entire Agreement. This instrument contains the entire agreement of the Parties and hereby terminates the previous Consulting Agreement entered into and effective May 12, 2008. This Agreement may not be changed orally but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, extension, or discharge is sought.
