ARTICLE 7

COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

  


Except as expressly permitted in Article 5 above, during the Term of this Agreement, (a) Employee shall not engage, directly or indirectly, in any business or activity competitive to any business or activity engaged in, or proposed to be engaged in, by Employer or (b) soliciting or taking away or interfering with any contractual relationship of any employee, agent, representative, contractor, supplier, vendor, customer, franchisee, lender or investor of Employer, or using, for the benefit of any person or entity other than Employer, any Confidential Information of Employer. The foregoing covenant prohibiting competitive activities shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall extend, and shall remain enforceable against Employee, with respect to any business or activity that Employer is engaging in as of the termination date of this Agreement and the territory for such business or activity, for the period of one (1) year following the date this Agreement is terminated.

Nothing in this Article 7 shall be deemed, however, to prevent Employee from owning securities of any publicly-owned corporation engaged in any such business, provided that the total amount of securities of each class owned by Employee in such publicly-owned corporation (other than Parent) does not exceed two percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of such class.

  


ARTICLE 8

SURVIVAL

  


Employee agrees that the provisions of Articles 6, 7 and 9, and Employer agrees that the last sentence of Article 7, shall survive expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reasons, whether voluntary or involuntary, with or without cause, and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated upon the dissolution of Employer, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by Employer or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors of the assets of Employer, Articles 6, 7 and 9 shall be of no further force or effect.

  


ARTICLE 9

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

  


Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Employee set forth in Articles 6 and 7 with respect to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and Employer’s property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause Employer irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Employee agrees that Employer shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain Employee from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations referred to in this Article 9. These injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies Employer may have at law or in equity.
