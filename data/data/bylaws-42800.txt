The members of the governing board of the Corporation shall be known as Directors, and the number of Directors shall be as fixed in the By-Laws and may, from time to time, be increased or decreased by a two-thirds (2/3) affirmative vote of the entire Board of Directors provided that the number shall not be increased to more than fifteen (15).

Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors for any reason, including any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of Directors, shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors, though less than a quorum.

ARTICLE IX

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

  


Section 1:

The private property of the stockholders, directors, or officers shall not be subject to the payment of any corporate debts to any extent whatsoever.

Section 2:

(A) To the fullest extent that the laws of the State of Nevada, as in effect on March 18, 1987, or as thereafter amended, permit elimination or limitation of the liability of directors and officers, no Director, officer, employee, fiduciary or authorized representative of the Company shall be personally liable for monetary damages as such for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, as a Director, officer or other representative capacity.

(B) This Article shall not apply to any action filed prior to March 18, 1987, nor to any breach of performance or failure of performance of duty by a Director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or authorized representative occurring prior to March, 1987. Any amendment or repeal of this Article which has the effect of increasing Director liability shall operate prospectively only, and shall not affect any action taken, or any failure to act, prior to its adoption.

14

* * *

Section 3:

(A) Right to Indemnification. Except as prohibited by law, every director and officer of the company shall be entitled as a matter of right to be indemnified by the company against reasonable expense and any liability paid or incurred by such person in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding, civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, whether brought by or in the right of the company or otherwise, in which he or she may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such person being or having been a Director or officer of the company or by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving at the request of the company as a Director, officer, employee, fiduciary or other representative of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity (such claim, action, suit, or proceeding hereinafter being referred to as “action”); provided, however, that no such right of indemnification shall exist with respect to an action brought by a director or officer against the company (other than a suit for indemnification as provided in paragraph (B)). Such indemnification shall include the right to have expenses incurred by such person in connection with an action paid in advance by the company prior to final disposition of such action, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by law. As used herein, “expense” shall include fees and expenses of counsel selected by such person; and “liability” shall include amounts of judgments, excise taxes, fines and penalties, and amounts paid in settlement.

(B) Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Section is not paid in full by the company within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action that the conduct of the claimant was such that under Nevada law the company would be prohibited from indemnifying the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the company. Neither the failure of the company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the conduct of the claimant was not such that indemnification would be prohibited by law, nor an actual determination by the company (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the conduct of the claimant was such that indemnification would be prohibited by law, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the conduct of the claimant was such that indemnification would be prohibited by law.

15

* * *

(C) Insurance and Funding. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any person eligible to be indemnified hereunder against any liability or expense asserted or incurred by such person in connection with any action, whether or not the company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability or expense by law or under the provisions of this Section 3. The company may make other financial arrangements which include a trust fund, program of self-insurance, grant a security interest or other lien on any assets of the corporation, establish a letter of credit, guaranty or surety as set forth in 1987 Statutes of Nevada, Chapter 28 to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided herein.

(D) Non-Exclusive; Nature and Extent of Rights. The right of indemnification provided for herein (1) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights, whether now existing or hereafter created, to which those seeking indemnification hereunder may be entitled under any agreement, by-law or article provision, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise, (2) shall be deemed to create contractual rights in favor of persons entitled to indemnification hereunder, (3) shall continue as to persons who have ceased to have the status pursuant to which they were entitled or were denominated as entitled to indemnification hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of persons entitled to indemnification hereunder and (4) shall be applicable to actions, suits or proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the adoption hereof. The right of indemnification provided for herein may not be amended, modified or repealed so as to limit in any way the indemnification provided for herein with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to the adoption of any such amendment or repeal.

  


16

* * *

Section 4:

In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors, by majority vote of those present at any called meeting, is expressly authorized:

(A) To hold its meetings, to have one or more offices, and to keep the books of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise specifically required by the laws of the State of Nevada, within or without the State of Nevada, at such places as may be from time to time designated by it.

(B) To determine from time to time whether, and if allowed under what conditions and regulations, the accounts and books of the Corporation (other than the books required by law to be kept at the principal office of the Corporation in Nevada), or any of them, shall be open to inspection of the stockholders, and the stockholders’ rights in this respect are and shall be restricted or limited accordingly.

(C) To make, alter, amend and rescind the By-Laws of the Corporation, to fix the amount to be reserved as working capital, to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends, and to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property of the Corporation.

(D) To designate from its number an executive committee, which, to the extent provided by the By-Laws of the Corporation or by resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise in the intervals between meetings of the Board of Directors, the powers thereof which may lawfully be delegated in respect of the management of the business and the affairs of the Corporation, and shall have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to such papers as may require it. The Board of Directors may also, in its discretion, designate from its number a finance committee and delegate thereto such of the powers of the Board of Directors as may be lawfully delegated, to be exercised when the Board is not in session.

ARTICLE X

OTHER CONSTITUENCIES PROVISIONS

Nothing in this paragraph shall create any duties owed by any Director to any person or entity to consider or afford any particular weight to any of the foregoing. For purposes of this paragraph, “control” shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Corporation, whether through the ownership of voting stock, by contract or other.
