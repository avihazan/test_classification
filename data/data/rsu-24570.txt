THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (“Agreement”), dated as of  (“Grant Date”), is entered into between NovaMed, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and  (“Participant”), an employee of NovaMed Management Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Employer”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the NovaMed, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Plan the Company desires to grant to the Participant shares of its Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Shares”), subject to certain restrictions set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Grant Date;

WHEREAS, the Committee has duly made all determinations necessary or appropriate to the grants hereunder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions. Any capitalized term used in this Agreement that is not defined in this Agreement will have the same meaning as that given to it in the Plan.

2. Grant of Restricted Stock.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the additional terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Participant, as a matter of separate agreement and not in lieu of salary or any other compensation for services,  ( ) Shares (the “Restricted Stock”).

3. Certificates. Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under Section 2 will be evidenced by one or more certificates bearing a legend referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. The Company will retain physical possession of such certificates, and Participant shall be required upon demand to execute and deliver one or more stock powers to the Company, endorsed in blank, relating to such shares or Restricted Stock for so long as such shares remain unvested and subject to a risk of forfeiture. Neither unvested shares of Restricted Stock, nor the right to vote such shares and receive dividends thereon, may be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered; provided, however, that Participant may grant to another person a revocable proxy to vote unvested shares of Restricted Stock at a Company stockholder meeting.

4. Rights. Participant will have full voting rights with respect to shares of Restricted Stock issued hereunder. Participant will be entitled to receive dividends on shares of Restricted Stock if and when dividends are payable on Shares to shareholders of record after the Grant Date; provided, however, that any dividends with respect to unvested shares of Restricted Stock will be subject to forfeiture and held by the Company in escrow or constructive trust for the Participant. Any such dividends held in escrow or constructive trust (i) will be forfeited immediately if the shares of unvested Restricted Stock to which they are attributable are forfeited and (ii) will cease to be subject to forfeiture when the shares of Restricted Stock to which they are attributable become vested and be paid to the Participant, subject to withholding, within ten days after the applicable vesting date. Dividends held by the Company in escrow or constructive trust for the Participant may be commingled with the general assets of the Company until paid.

5. Delivery and Withholding. Subject to satisfaction of any tax withholding obligation as described below, shares of Restricted Stock that are no longer subject to forfeiture will be transferred and delivered to Participant as soon as practicable after the date on which they vest in accordance with Section 2(b). Upon the vesting of shares of Restricted Stock, the prohibition against the sale or transfer of such shares will be lifted and such shares may be treated as any other Shares, subject to any restrictions on transfer that may be applicable under federal securities laws. In the absence of an effective election under Section 83(b) of the Code, the payment to Participant and transfer of such shares of Restricted Stock upon vesting will be subject to withholding by the Company of amounts sufficient to cover withholding obligations applicable to such payment and transfer. In the event that any required tax withholding upon the settlement of such Restricted Stock exceeds Participant’s regular compensation available to satisfy such withholding, Participant agrees to remit to the Company, as a condition of settlement of the Restricted Stock, such additional amounts as are necessary to satisfy such required withholding. Any withholding obligation may be settled either in cash or with Shares, including by withholding Shares that are otherwise deliverable hereunder upon vesting of Restricted Stock.

6. Plan. Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Restricted Stock is granted pursuant to the Plan, as in effect on the date of the Agreement, and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided by the Plan no amendment to either the Plan or this Agreement will deprive the Participant, without the Participant’s consent, of any shares of Restricted Stock or of Participant’s

7. No Employment Rights. No provision of this Agreement or of the Restricted Stock will give Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates, create any inference as to the length of employment of the Participant, affect the right of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of the Participant, with or without Cause, or give Participant any right to participate in any employee welfare or benefit plan or other program (other than the Plan) of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

8. Changes in Company’s Capital or Organizational Structure. The existence of the Restricted Stock shall not affect in any way the right or authority of the Company or its shareholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Company’s capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of preferred Shares ahead of or affecting the Shares or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

9. Delays. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Company shall have the right to suspend or delay any time period prescribed in this Agreement or in the Plan for any action if the Committee shall determine that the action may constitute a violation of any law or result in any liability under any law to the Company, an Affiliate or a shareholder in the Company until such time as the action required or permitted will not constitute a violation of law or result in liability to the Company, an Affiliate or a shareholder of the Company.

10. Governing Law; Construction. This Agreement and the Restricted Stock will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to conflicts of law principles.

12. Amendment. Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the Company.

13. Waiver; Cumulative Rights. The failure or delay of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement will not affect its right to require performance of such provision unless and until such performance has been waived in writing. Each right under this Agreement is cumulative and may be exercised in part or in whole from time to time.
