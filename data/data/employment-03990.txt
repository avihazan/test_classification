The amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be increased to the extent necessary to pay income and excise taxes and penalties due on such amount. The determination of the amount of any such tax indemnity shall initially be made by the independent accounting firm employed by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control, or if such firm is unwilling to complete such calculations, such independent accounting or consulting firm as the Company may select in its discretion. 

(ii) If at a later date it is determined (pursuant to final regulations or published rulings of the IRS, final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise) that the amount of excise taxes and penalties payable by Executive is greater than the amount initially so determined, then the Company (or its successor) shall pay Executive an amount equal to the sum of (1) such additional excise taxes and penalties, and (2) any interest, fines and penalties resulting from such underpayment, plus (3) any additional amount necessary to reimburse Executive for any income, excise or other taxes payable by Executive with respect to the amounts specified in (1) and (2) above, and the reimbursement provided by this clause (3).
