This Restricted Stock Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of ______________________, 200__ between SPARTAN MOTORS, INC., a Michigan corporation ("Spartan Motors"), and ____________________________________ ("Grantee").

The Spartan Motors, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 200__ (the "Plan") is administered by the Compensation Committee of Spartan Motors's Board of Directors (the "Committee"). The Committee has determined that Grantee is eligible to participate in the Plan. The Committee agrees to award restricted stock to Grantee, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in the Plan.

Grantee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and the Plan Description, and accepts this restricted stock award subject to all of the terms, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan.

1\. Award. Spartan Motors hereby awards to Grantee, as of the Date of Award, ______ shares of Spartan Motors' common stock, $.01 par value, subject to conditions and restrictions imposed under this Agreement and the Plan (the "Restricted Stock"). Spartan Motors may issue share certificates with respect to the Restricted Stock or may deposit the Restricted Stock into an electronic account maintained by a third party, in which case the share certificates with respect to the Restricted Stock may, in Spartan Motors' discretion, not be issued until the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Stock have lapsed.

2\. Transferability. Until the restrictions lapse as set forth in paragraph 3 below, the Plan provides that Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement is generally not transferable by Grantee except by will or according to the laws of descent and distribution, and further provides that all rights with respect to the Restricted Stock are exercisable during Grantee's lifetime only by Grantee, Grantee's guardian, or legal representative. Spartan Motors shall place an appropriate legend upon any certificate representing shares of Restricted Stock awarded under this Agreement and may also issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to such shares.

3\. Lapsing of Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall lapse as follows: ______ shares of the Restricted Stock will vest on __________, 200__; _______ shares of the Restricted Stock will vest on ___________, 200__ (_______ shares vested) and ______ shares of the Restricted Stock will vest on ___________, 200__ (______ shares vested). The periods during which Restricted Stock is subject to restrictions imposed by the Plan and under this Agreement shall be known as "Restricted Periods."

4\. Securities Laws. The Restricted Stock award under this Agreement is conditional upon (i) the effective registration of the Plan and the Restricted Stock granted thereunder under the Securities Act of 1933 and the effective registration or exemption of the Plan and the Restricted Stock granted thereunder under applicable state or foreign securities laws, and (ii) the effective listing of the stock on any applicable securities exchange or quotation system. Grantee shall not resell or distribute the Restricted Stock after any Restricted Period except in compliance with such conditions as Spartan Motors may reasonably specify to ensure compliance with federal and state securities laws.

5\. Termination of Employment, Directorship or Officer Status. If Grantee's employment, directorship and/or officer status (each as applicable) with Spartan Motors or any of its subsidiaries terminates for any reason, such termination shall affect the Restricted Stock, and Grantee's rights with respect to the Restricted Stock, as set forth in the Plan. 

6\. Employment by Spartan Motors. To the extent Grantee is or becomes an employee of Spartan Motors or any of its subsidiaries, the award of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall not impose upon Spartan Motors or any of its subsidiaries any obligation to retain Grantee in its employ for any given period or upon any specific terms of employment. Spartan Motors or any of its subsidiaries, as appropriate, may at any time dismiss Grantee from employment, free from any liability or claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in any written agreement with Grantee.

7\. Shareholder Rights. During the Restricted Period, Grantee shall have all voting, dividend, liquidation, and other rights with respect to the Restricted Stock held of record by Grantee as if Grantee held unrestricted common stock; provided, however, that the unvested portion of any Restricted Stock award shall be subject to any restrictions on transferability or risks of forfeiture imposed pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan. Any noncash dividends or distributions paid with respect to shares of unvested Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the shares to which such dividends or distributions relate. After the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock lapse, Grantee shall have all shareholder rights, including the right to transfer the shares, subject to such conditions as Spartan Motors may reasonably specify to ensure compliance with federal and state securities laws.

8\. Withholding. Spartan Motors and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from Grantee's future wages (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to Grantee from Spartan Motors and/or its subsidiaries), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, state, and local withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to the Restricted Stock award under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the award or vesting of, or payments of dividends with respect to, the Restricted Stock; or (b) require Grantee promptly to remit the amount of such withholding to Spartan Motors before taking any action with respect to the Restricted Stock. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, withholding may be satisfied by withholding common stock to be received or by delivery to Spartan Motors of previously owned common s tock of Spartan Motors.

9\. Effective Date. This Agreement shall be effective as of ____________, 20___.

10\. Amendment. This Agreement shall not be modified except in a writing executed by the parties to this Agreement.

11\. Agreement Controls. The Plan is incorporated in this Agreement by reference. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement will have those meanings provided in the Plan.
