Form of Exercise. Each election to exercise the Option shall be in writing, signed by the Participant, and received by the Company at its principal office, accompanied by this agreement, and payment in full in the manner provided in the Plan. The Participant may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of the Option may be for any fractional share.  
  
b)

Continuous Relationship with the Company Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Participant, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee or officer of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company as defined in Section 424(e) or (f) of the Code (an “Eligible Participant”).

If the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) below, the right to exercise the Option shall terminate three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), provided that the Option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise the Option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, the right to exercise the Option shall terminate immediately upon such violation.  
  
c)

Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability.

If the Participant is party to an employment, consulting or severance agreement with the Company that contains a definition of “cause” for termination of employment, “Cause” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such agreement. Otherwise, “Cause” shall mean willful misconduct by the Participant or willful failure by the Participant to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Participant of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Participant and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. The Participant’s employment shall be considered to have been terminated for “Cause” if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Participant’s resignation, that termination for “Cause” was warranted.  
  
6\. 

Tax Matters.  
  
a)

Withholding.

Notice is hereby given of the following option grant (the “Option”), as of ____ (the “Grant Date”), to be held in trust by ESOP Trust Company (the “Trustee”) for _______ (the “Optionee”) until exercised, to purchase _____ shares (the “Option Shares”) of the Common Stock of LivePerson, Inc. (the “Company”) at an exercise price equal to $___ per share (the “Exercise Price”).

The provisions specified in this notice of grant (the “Grant Notice”) shall form an integral part of the LivePerson, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). This Grant Notice completes the Plan and the attached LivePerson, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan Israeli Appendix (the “Appendix”) so that they comply with the requirements set by the provisions of Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance (New Version) 1961 (the “Ordinance”), as amended, and any regulations, rules, orders or procedures promulgated there under as may be regulated, amended, or replaced from time to time (“Section 102”) with respect to any Option to be granted by the Corporation to Israeli Optionees, subject to this Grant Notice. The Plan, the Appendix and this Grant Notice are complementary to each other and shall be deemed as one with respect to any Option to be issued to the employees and members of the Board of LivePerson Ltd. (the “Company”). In any case of contradiction, whether explicit or implied, between the provisions of this Grant Notice and the Plan or the Appendix, the provisions set out in the Plan and the Appendix shall prevail.

The Option is allocated to the Trustee under the 102 Capital Gain Track and is subject to the provisions of Section 102 and the following terms:

(a) 

The Option is subject to Section 102 and the terms that apply to a Non-Statutory Stock Option in the Plan.  
  
(b) 

The Option may only be granted to an Israeli person employed by the Company or by an Israeli subsidiary of the Company or any person who is engaged as an officer of the Company or of an Israeli subsidiary of the Company, and that is not a "controlling party", as defined in section 32 (9) of the Ordinance, prior to and after the issuance of the Option.  
  
(c) 

The Option and the Option Shares issued upon the exercise of the Option will be held by the Trustee for a period of at least 24 months from the date on which such Option is allocated to the Trustee or a shorter period as approved by the tax authorities (the “Lock-up Period”), under the terms set in Section 102. In accordance with Section 102, the Optionee is prohibited from selling the Option or the Option Shares issued upon the exercise of the Option, until the end of the Lock-up Period, unless otherwise determined by the Tax Authorities. The meaning of the above restriction for purposes of the Tax Authorities is that if the Employee voluntarily sells the Option or the Option Shares before the end of the Lock-up Period, the Option or the Option Shares shall be subject to tax as ordinary income as per sections 2(1) and 2(2) of the Ordinance, and other provisions of Section 102.  
  
(d) 

All rights related to the Option Shares will be held by the Trustee until the end of the Lock-up Period, including bonus shares, and will be subject to the provisions of Section 102 regarding the 102 Capital Gain Track.

Any and all taxes, fees and other liabilities (as may apply from time to time) in connection with the grant and/or exercise of the Option and the sale of Option Shares issued upon the exercise of the Option, will be borne by the Optionee and s/he will be solely liable for all such taxes, fees and other liabilities. Furthermore, the Optionee shall agree to indemnify the Corporation and the Company and hold them harmless against and from any and all liability for any such tax or interest or penalty thereon.  
  
(g) 

The Optionee acknowledges that the receipt of the Option and the acquisition of the Option Shares to be issued upon the exercise of the Option may result in tax consequences. The description set forth in the Plan relating to the payment of tax does not purport to be a full and complete description of the Optionee’s tax obligations under the law.  
  
(h) 

Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall not release any part of the Option which was not already exercised into Option Shares by the Optionee nor release any Option Shares issued upon an exercise of the Option, prior to the full payment of the Exercise Price and Optionee’s tax liability arising from the Option that was granted to him and/or Option Shares issued upon exercise of such Option.
