During the period ending immediately before the date one year after the Date of Award, all Shares will be subject to forfeiture and nontransferable by the Awardee. On the date ending one

On the date ending four years after the Date of Award, a cumulative 100% of the Shares awarded will become transferable by the Awardee. During the Restriction Periods, the nontransferable Shares shall bear a legend indicating their nontransferability. If the Awardee terminates service for any reason, including without limitation, upon death or disability, during the Restriction Periods, the Awardee shall forfeit the Shares which remain nontransferable at that time If, at the end of the last Restriction Period, the Awardee is and has been continuously in the service of the Company since the Date of Award, all of the awarded Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable.

4\. Medium of Payment. The Award shall be made or otherwise settled in shares of Company Stock. The Company shall withhold sufficient shares to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold for tax requirements at the time of delivery or vesting of shares hereunder, as appropriate, if Awardee is at the time of vesting subject to the Company’s policies regarding restrictions on trading within specified trading “windows”, and the Company may, in its sole discretion, so withhold if Awardee is not subject to such restrictions upon Awardee’s request. In the event that the Company withholds shares as contemplated in this Section, the Awardee shall receive a net number of shares equal to the shares to which the Awardee is otherwise entitled hereunder, less the number of shares withheld by the Company

Such arrangements for payment of withholding may include, for example, directing an appropriate broker to sell such number of shares as necessary to result in a cash amount equal to the withholding requirements. 

5. Termination of Service. Awardee shall forfeit the Shares to the extent not vested prior to Awardee’s termination of service. The Shares hereby granted shall not be affected by any change of service so long as Awardee continues to be a service provider to the Company or a subsidiary thereof. Nothing herein shall confer on Awardee the right to continue in the service of the Company or any subsidiary or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any subsidiary thereof to terminate Awardee’s service at any time. 

6\. Committee Administration. This award has been made pursuant to a determination made by the Committee, and such Committee or any successor or substitute committee authorized by the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, subject to the express terms of this agreement, shall have plenary authority to interpret any provision of this agreement and to make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this agreement and may waive or amend any provisions hereof in any manner not adversely affecting the rights granted to the Awardee by the express terms hereof. 

7\. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Awardee is deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or sate courts of Missouri, County of St. Louis, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement.
