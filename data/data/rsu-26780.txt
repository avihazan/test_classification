Dear [ ]:

  


I am pleased to inform you that Cree, Inc. (the “Company”) has awarded [ ] Performance Shares (the “Performance Shares”) to you effective [ ] (the “Grant Date”). The Performance Shares are subject to and governed by the terms of the Cree, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) and the terms of this Performance Share Award Agreement (the “Agreement”).

  


Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you are eligible to earn the Performance Shares based on [ ], as follows:

  


[ ]

  


Except as provided in the Company’s Severance Plan for Section 16 Officers, if such plan is then in effect, and except as provided below with respect to your death or LTD Disability (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement between you and the Company effective [ ] (the “Change in Control Agreement”)) or a Change in Control (as defined in Section [ ] of the Change in Control Agreement), (i) you must be continuously in service with the Company or any Employer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company through the vesting date specified above for Performance Shares in order to have a right to payment of such Performance Shares on such vesting date, (ii) the Performance Shares will not be considered earned until the vesting date specified above for the Performance Shares, and (iii) if you incur a Termination of Service prior to [ ], with or without cause, you will forfeit all the Performance Shares that are not vested on the date of such Termination of Service.

  


Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to ensure that the Company’s best interests are met, except as specifically provided in the Change in Control Agreement, the Committee in its discretion may decrease or eliminate the amount payable pursuant to the Performance Shares at any time prior to payment if it determines in good faith that payment of the full amount otherwise payable pursuant to the Performance Shares is not warranted or appropriate; provided, however, so long as you are not in breach of your Confidential Information Agreement (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), following (i) the commencement of a tender offer or the Company and another party entering into a written agreement that contemplates a transaction, the consummation of either of which would result in a Change in Control as defined in [ ] of such definition, or (ii) a Change in Control (including without limitation a resulting Change in Control described in clause (i)), the Committee may not decrease or eliminate the amount payable as otherwise determined in accordance with this Agreement without your prior written consent, except that this restriction shall cease to apply if the tender offer or the written agreement is terminated or expires without the occurrence of a Change in Control.

  


If there is a Change in Control and you remain continuously employed by the Company through the end of a Fiscal Year, but your employment terminates In Connection with a Change in Control upon or after the end of such Fiscal Year but prior to the [ ] immediately following the end of such Fiscal Year, you will vest in any Performance Shares 

  


  


* * *

  


  


that would otherwise have vested on such [ ] in accordance with this Agreement. However, if there is a Change in Control and your employment terminates prior to the end of a Fiscal Year, you will not vest in any Performance Shares on the [ ] immediately following the end of such Fiscal Year. “In Connection with a Change of Control” will have the same meaning as in Section [ ] of the Change in Control Agreement.

  


You will vest in a pro rata portion of the Performance Shares on the date of your death or on the effective date of the determination of your LTD Disability by the Employee Benefits Committee of the Company (the “EBC”) or such other committee as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, and you will forfeit the remainder of the Performance Shares on such date. The portion of the Performance Shares in which you will vest under the immediately prior sentence shall be determined by (i) multiplying the total number of Performance Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of calendar days that have elapsed beginning with [ ], and with the date of your death or LTD Disability, as applicable, and the denominator of which is [ ], rounded up to the nearest whole number of Performance Shares (as necessary), and (ii) subtracting the number of Performance Shares in which you vested prior to the date of your death or LTD Disability, as applicable, pursuant to [ ] above (if any). The determination of whether or not you have a LTD Disability will be made by the EBC in good faith in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be conclusive, final and binding upon all parties. The above definition of LTD Disability applies in lieu of the definition of disability set out in the Plan.

  


This award is intended to fulfill any and all agreements, obligations or promises, whether legally binding or not, previously made by the Company or any Employer under the Plan to grant you Performance Shares for [ ]. By signing below, you accept such award, along with all prior awards received by you, in full satisfaction of any such agreement, obligation or promise.

  


Nothing in this Agreement is intended to modify or amend the Change in Control Agreement, including but not limited to your right to receive the payment specified in Section [ ] thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Change in Control Agreement (applied as if the Performance Shares constitute “performance units” for purposes of the Change in Control Agreement).

BY SIGNING BELOW YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FAILURE TO SIGN WILL RESULT IN FORFEITURE OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES.

3.

Responsibility for Taxes.  
  
(a)

For purposes of this Agreement, “Tax-Related Items” means any or all income tax, social insurance tax, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items that may be applicable to the Performance Shares by law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or local, domestic or foreign. Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to withholding Tax-Related Items, you acknowledge that you are ultimately responsible for all Tax-Related Items and that such Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Shares, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or payment with respect to the Performance Shares, the subsequent sale of Shares and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Performance Shares to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former Employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. If permissible under local law and at your election, the Company will satisfy this condition pursuant to the withholding of Shares consistent with the “Share Withholding” provisions under Section [ ] of the Plan. The Company, in its discretion, may authorize alternative arrangements, including, if permissible under local law, the Company's selling or arranging to sell Shares that you acquire under the Plan. In any event, to the extent this condition is not otherwise satisfied, you authorize the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Employer.  
  
  
  
  
(c)

Depending upon the withholding method, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. In the event Tax-Related Items are over-withheld, you will receive a refund in cash for any over-withheld amounts and will have no entitlement to the Shares equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding of Shares, you shall be deemed, for tax purposes, to have been issued the full number of Shares, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.  
  
  


  


* * *

The Company may refuse to make payment with respect to the Performance Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.  
  
  
  
  
4.

Transfer of Performance Shares. The Performance Shares and any rights under any Performance Share may not be assigned, pledged as collateral or otherwise transferred, except as permitted by the Plan, nor may they be subject to attachment, execution or other judicial process. In the event of any attempt to assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of a Performance Share or any rights under a Performance Share, except as permitted by the Plan, or in the event of the levy of any attachment, execution or similar judicial process upon the rights or interests conferred by a Performance Share, the Committee may in its discretion terminate a Performance Share by notice to you.  
  
  
  
  
5.

Rights Prior to Vesting of Shares.  
  
(a)

You will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable under the Performance Shares, including but not limited to voting rights or rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, until such Shares have been duly issued by the Company or its transfer agent pursuant to the vesting and payment of the Performance Shares.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

In the event of a change in capitalization within the meaning of Section [ ] of the Plan, the number and class of Shares or other securities that you are entitled to pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted or changed as determined by the Committee to reflect the change in capitalization, provided that any such additional Shares or additional or different shares of securities shall remain subject to the restrictions in this Agreement.  
  
  
  
  
6.

Termination of Service: Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan, for purposes of this Agreement “Termination of Service” means the discontinuance of your relationship with the Company as an employee of the Company or the Employer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company under the Plan or as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Except as determined otherwise by the Committee, you will not be deemed to have incurred a Termination of Service if the capacity in which you provide services to the Company changes (for example, you change from being a non-employee director to being an employee) or if you transfer employment among the various subsidiaries or affiliates of the Company constituting the Employer, so long as there is no interruption in your provision of services to the Company or other Employer as an employee or as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company.
