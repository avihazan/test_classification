  3. Exercise of Stock Purchase Right

    1. Participant hereby agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to sell to Participant, any and all vested Shares subject to the Stock Purchase Right as they vest from time to time, in consideration of services rendered to the Company by Participant and otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. Immediately upon such vesting from time to time of Shares subject to the Stock Purchase Right: (1) the Stock Purchase Right shall be deemed to be exercised to the extent of the vested Shares as of the date of such vesting; and (2) the Company shall issue the vested Shares to Participant in consideration of services rendered to the Company by Participant, in accordance with Section 7.3(b) of the Plan. 

    2. As soon as practicable after the vesting of any and all Shares, Participant's name shall be entered as the stockholder of record on the books and records of the transfer agent for the Company with respect to the vested Shares subject to compliance with all requirements under applicable laws or regulations in connection with such issuance and with the requirements of this Agreement and of the Plan. The determination of the Committee as to such compliance shall be final and binding on Participant.

    3. No fraction of a Share shall be delivered to Participant at any time. In the event that, from time to time, the number of Shares that vest and would otherwise be deliverable to Participant includes a fraction of a Share, the number of Shares that shall be deliverable to Participant shall be adjusted to the nearest smaller whole number of Shares.

    4. Until such time as any Shares subject to the Stock Purchase Right have vested and been issued to Participant pursuant to this Section 3, Participant shall not have any rights as a holder of such Shares, including, but not limited to, voting rights, rights to receive dividends and other distributions with respect to Common Stock, and stockholder inspection rights.

  4. Termination of Service

Participant's right to purchase any Shares that are not vested as of the date on which Participant's Service has ceased shall automatically terminate on such date, and the Stock Purchase Right shall be canceled as provided under the Plan and shall be of no further force and effect. In the event of termination of Service, the Company, as soon as practicable following the effective date of termination, shall issue Shares to Participant (or Participant's designated beneficiary or estate executor in the event of Participant's death) with respect to any Shares which, as of the effective date of termination of Service, have vested but for which Shares had not yet been issued to Participant. 

  5. Adjustments

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by the Stock Purchase Right shall be proportionately adjusted for certain corporate actions in accordance with and pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Plan. Such adjustments shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or purchase price of Shares subject to the Stock Purchase Right.
