AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

The Compensation & Management Development Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to the Newfield Exploration Company 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan (the “Plan”), hereby awards to you, the above-named awardee, effective as of the Date of Award set forth above (the “Date of Award”), that number of restricted stock units set forth above (the “Restricted Stock Units”), on the following terms and conditions:

The Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the prohibitions and restrictions set forth herein with respect to the sale or other disposition of such Restricted Stock Units and the obligation to forfeit and surrender such Restricted Stock Units to the Company (the “Forfeiture Restrictions”). The Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to the Restricted Stock Units that are awarded hereby in accordance with the following schedule provided that your employment with the Company and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries has not terminated prior to the applicable lapse date:

(a)

on the second anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date, the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to one-third of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement; and  
  
(b)

on each succeeding anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date, the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to an additional one-third of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement, so that on the fourth anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to all of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement.  
  
If a Change of Control of the Company occurs, you die, become Disabled or your employment terminates by reason of a Qualified Retirement, in each case, before the fourth anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date, your rights to the Restricted Stock Units under this Agreement will be determined as provided in the attached Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”).

Upon the lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall issue to you one share of the Company’s Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), in exchange for each such Restricted Stock Unit and thereafter you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock Unit and such shares of the Common Stock shall be transferable by you (except to the extent that any proposed transfer would, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, constitute a violation of applicable federal or state securities law).

* * *

If during the period in which you hold the Restricted Stock Units the Company pays a dividend in shares of the Common Stock with respect to the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, then the Company will increase the Restricted Stock Units that have not then been exchanged by the Company for shares of the Common Stock by an amount equal to the product of (a) the Restricted Stock Units that have not been forfeited to the Company or exchanged by the Company for shares of the Common Stock and (b) the number of shares of the Common Stock paid by the Company per share of the Common Stock (collectively, the “Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Units”). Each Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Unit will be subject to same Forfeiture Restrictions and other restrictions, limitations and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Unit for which such Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Unit was awarded and will be exchanged for shares of the Common Stock at the same time and on the same basis as such Restricted Stock Unit.

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan, shares of Common Stock shall be transferred at the time(s) specified in this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.

The Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, encumbered or disposed of (other than by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution). Any such attempted sale, assignment, pledge, exchange, hypothecation, transfer, encumbrance or disposition in violation of this Agreement shall be void and the Company shall not be bound thereby. Any shares of Common Stock issued to you in exchange for the Restricted Stock Units may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws. You also agree that (a) the Company may refuse to cause the transfer of any such shares of the Common Stock to be registered on the stock register of the Company if such proposed transfer would in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities law and (b) the Company may give related instructions to the transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of such shares of the Common Stock.

The shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a Registration Statement on Form S-8.

Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Plan or the Terms and Conditions.

In accepting the award of the Restricted Stock Units you accept and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Plan, this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.

NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1\. 

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT/CHANGE OF CONTROL. The following provisions will apply in the event your employment with the Company and all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company Group”) terminates, or a Change of Control of the Company occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date (the “Fourth Anniversary Date”) under the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement awarded to you (the “Agreement”):  
  
1.1 Termination Generally. If your employment with the Company Group terminates on or before the Fourth Anniversary Date for any reason other than one of the reasons described in Sections 1.2 through 1.5 below, the Forfeiture Restrictions then applicable to the Restricted Stock Units shall not lapse and the number of Restricted Stock Units then subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions shall be forfeited to the Company on the date your employment terminates.  
  
1.2 Change of Control. The impact of a Change of Control of the Company on the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined under the provisions of this Section 1.2 rather than under any provisions of the Plan dealing with vesting or the lapse of forfeiture restrictions. If a Change of Control of the Company occurs on or before the Fourth Anniversary Date and you do not terminate employment with the Company Group before the date the Change of Control of the Company occurs, then all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse on the date the Change of Control of the Company occurs if the Change of Control of the Company qualifies as a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the final Department of Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (“Section 409A”).  
  
1.3 Disability. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, if before the Fourth Anniversary Date you incur a Separation From Service due to your having incurred a Disability, then all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the date you incur a Separation From Service due to your Disability if you are not a Specified Employee or on the date that is six months following your Separation From Service if you are a Specified Employee; provided, however, that if you die before the expiration of such six-month delay period (if applicable) then all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the date of your death. For purposes of this Section 1.3, you will be treated as having a “Disability” if you (a) are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (b) are, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company Group. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Separation From Service” has the meaning ascribed to that term in Section 409A and “Specified Employee” means a person who is, as of the date of the person’s Separation From Service, a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A, taking into account any elections made and procedures established in resolutions adopted by the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board.

* * *

1.4  Death. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, if you die before the Fourth Anniversary Date and before you have otherwise terminated employment with the Company Group, all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the date of the termination of your employment due to death.  
  
1.5 Qualified Retirement. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, if you incur a Separation From Service as a result of your Qualified Retirement before the Fourth Anniversary Date, then the number of Restricted Stock Units issued to you under the Agreement shall automatically be reduced (without further action by you and/or the Company) on the date you incur a Separation From Service to that number of Restricted Stock Units determined under the following formula (the “Retirement Adjusted Restricted Stock Units”):  
  
(1) multiplied by (2) divided by (3)

where (1) is the number of the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which Forfeiture Restrictions would have otherwise lapsed on the next anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date following your Separation From Service due to Qualified Retirement, (2) is the number of days, if any, that have elapsed (excluding the date of your Separation From Service) since the most recent anniversary of the Vesting Effective Date before the date you incur a Separation From Service due to Qualified Retirement, and (3) is 365.

The excess of the Restricted Stock Units that were originally awarded to you under the Agreement over the Retirement Adjusted Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited on the date you incur a Separation From Service due to Qualified Retirement. The Forfeiture Restrictions with respect to the Retirement Adjusted Restricted Stock Units shall immediately lapse on the date you incur a Separation From Service due to your Qualified Retirement if you are not a Specified Employee or on the date that is six months following your Separation From Service if you are a Specified Employee; provided, however, that if you die before the expiration of such six-month delay period (if applicable) then all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the date of your death.

For purposes of this Section 1.5 “Qualified Retirement” means you (i) either are (A) at least age 60 and sign a non-compete agreement (the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) that is effective until your reaching age 62 or (B) are at least age 62, (ii) have at least 10 years of Qualified Service and (iii) provide the Requisite Notice. “Qualified Service” means (i) your continuous employment with (A) the Company or (B) a subsidiary of the Company during the time that such subsidiary is, directly or indirectly, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company plus (b) any additional service credit granted to you (or a group of employees of which you are a member) by the Board. “Requisite Notice” means (a) if you are an officer of the Company, at least six months prior written notice to the Board or (b) otherwise, at least three months prior written notice to the chief executive officer of the Company.

2\. 

PROHIBITED ACTIVITY. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions or the Agreement, if you engage in a “Prohibited Activity,” as described below, while employed by one or more members of the Company Group or within two years after the date your employment with the Company Group terminates, then your right to receive the shares of the Common Stock, to the extent still outstanding at that time, shall be completely forfeited. A "Prohibited Activity" shall be deemed to have occurred, as determined by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, if you divulge any non-public, confidential or proprietary information of the Company Group, but excluding information that (a) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of your public use, disclosure, or fault, or (b) becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis after your employment termination date from a source other than a member of the Company Group prior to the public use or disclosure by you, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.  
  
3\. 

TAX WITHHOLDING. To the extent that the receipt of the Restricted Stock Units or the lapse of any forfeiture restrictions results in income, wages or other compensation to you for any income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to which the Company has a withholding obligation, you shall deliver to the Company at the time of such receipt or lapse, as the case may be, such amount of money as the Company may require to meet its obligation under applicable tax laws or regulations, and, if you fail to do so, the Company is authorized to withhold from any shares of Common Stock issued under the Agreement or from any cash or stock remuneration or other payment then or thereafter payable to you any tax required to be withheld by reason of such taxable income, wages or compensation including (without limitation) shares of the Common Stock sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation. No shares of Common Stock shall be withheld from the shares issued under the Agreement in excess of the Company’s minimum statutory withholding obligations (determined using the minimum statutory withholding rates required by the relevant tax authorities, including your share of payroll taxes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income.)  
  
4\. 

NONTRANSFERABILITY. The Agreement is not transferable by you otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  
  
5\. 

CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS AND REORGANIZATIONS. The existence of the Restricted Stock Units shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or any company the stock of which is awarded pursuant to the Agreement to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in its capital structure or its business, engage in any merger or consolidation, issue any debt or equity securities, dissolve or liquidate, or sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its assets or business, or engage in any other corporate act or proceeding.

* * *

6\. 

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS DO NOT AWARD ANY RIGHTS OF A STOCKHOLDER. You shall not have the voting rights or any of the other rights, powers or privileges of a holder of the Common Stock with respect to the Restricted Stock Units that are awarded hereby. Only after a share of the Common Stock is issued in exchange for a Restricted Stock Unit will you have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such share of Common Stock issued in exchange for a Restricted Stock Unit.  
  
7\. 

EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. For purposes of the Agreement, you shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company Group as long as you have an employment relationship with the Company Group. The Committee shall determine any questions as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment relationship, and the cause of such termination, under the Plan and the Committee’s determination shall be final and binding on all persons.  
  
8\. 

NOT AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. The Agreement is not an employment agreement, and no provision of the Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to create an employment relationship between you and any member of the Company Group or guarantee the right to remain employed by any member of the Company Group for any specified term.  
  
9\. 

SECURITIES ACT LEGEND. If you are an officer or affiliate of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, you consent to the placing on any certificate for the shares of the Common Stock issued under the Agreement an appropriate legend restricting resale or other transfer of such shares except in accordance with such Act and all applicable rules thereunder.  
  
10\. 

LIMIT OF LIABILITY. Under no circumstances will any member of the Company Group be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages (including lost profits) of any form incurred by any person, whether or not foreseeable and regardless of the form of the act in which such a claim may be brought, with respect to the Plan.  
  
11\. 

FUNDING. You shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any assets of the Company or any investments which the Company may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under this Agreement. Your right to receive payments under this Agreement shall be no greater than the right to an unsecured general creditor of the Company.  
  
12\. 

MISCELLANEOUS. The Agreement is awarded pursuant to and is subject to all of the provisions of the Plan, including amendments to the Plan, if any. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Plan provisions, the Plan provisions will control. The term “you” and “your” refer to the Awardee named in the Agreement. Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan or the Agreement.
