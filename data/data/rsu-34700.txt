(b) Termination of Employment For Other Reasons.

12. Trading Black Out Policies. The Participant agrees to abide by all trading “black out” policies established from time to time by the Company.

13. No Employment Rights. Nothing in this Agreement will confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates or affect the right of the Company to terminate the employment of the Participant at any time for any reason.

14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to principals of conflicts of laws, and applicable provisions of federal law.
