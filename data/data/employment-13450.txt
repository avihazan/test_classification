4

* * *

  


use or disclose any Trade Secrets of the Company during or after his or her employment. Employee agrees that the provisions of this subsection shall be deemed sufficient to protect Trade Secrets of third parties provided to the Company under an obligation of secrecy. As provided by Georgia statutes, “Trade Secret” shall mean any information (including, but not limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential customers) that: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

b. Protection of Other Confidential Information. In addition, Employee agrees to maintain in strict confidence and, except as necessary to perform his or her duties for the Company, not to use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Company during his or her employment and for a period of 12 months following termination of Employee’s employment. “Confidential Information” shall mean any internal, non-public information (other than Trade Secrets already addressed above) concerning (without limitation) the Company’s financial position and results of operations (including revenues, assets, net income, etc.); annual and long-range business plans; product or service plans; marketing plans and methods; training, educational and administrative manuals; supplier information and purchase histories; customers or clients; personnel and salary information; and employee lists. Employee agrees that the provisions of this subsection shall be deemed sufficient to protect Confidential Information of third parties provided to the Company under an obligation of secrecy.

c. Rights to Work Product. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company alone shall be entitled to all benefits, profits and results arising from or incidental to Employee’s performance of his or her job duties to the Company. To the greatest extent possible, any work product, property, data, invention, “know-how,” documentation or information or materials prepared, conceived, discovered, developed or created by Employee in connection with performing his or her employment responsibilities during Employee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed to be “work made for hire” as defined in the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.A. §101 et seq., as amended, and owned exclusively and perpetually by the Company. Employee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably transfers and assigns to the Company all intellectual property or other rights, title and interest Employee may currently have (or in the future may have) by operation of law or otherwise in or to any work product. Employee agrees to execute and deliver to the Company any transfers, assignments, documents or other instruments which the Company may deem necessary or appropriate to vest complete and perpetual title and ownership of any work product and all associated rights exclusively in the Company. The Company shall have the right to adapt, change, revise, delete from, add to and/or rearrange the work product or any part thereof written or created by Employee, and to combine the same with other works to any extent, and to change or substitute the title thereof, and in this connection Employee hereby waives the “moral rights” of authors as that term is commonly understood throughout the world including, without limitation, any similar rights or principles of law which Employee may now or later have by virtue of the law of any locality, state, nation, treaty, convention or other source. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, Employee shall not be entitled to any additional compensation, beyond his or her salary, for any exercise by the Company of its rights set forth in the preceding sentence.

d. Return of Materials. Employee shall surrender to the Company, promptly upon its request and in any event upon termination of Employee’s employment, all media, documents, notebooks, computer programs, handbooks, data files, models, samples, price lists, drawings, customer

5

* * *

  


lists, prospect data or other material of any nature whatsoever (in tangible or electronic form) in the Employee’s possession or control, including all copies thereof, relating to the Company, its business or its customers. Upon the request of the Company, employee shall certify in writing compliance with the foregoing requirement.

11. Severability

It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time or to apply to business activities which is not permitted by applicable law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and any other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable law.

If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

This agreement supersedes any prior employment agreement between Employer and Employee.

12. Waiver of Provisions 

Failure of either party to insist, in one or more instances, on performance by the other in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right granted hereunder or of the future performance of any such term or condition or of any other term of condition of this Agreement, unless such waiver’s contained in a writing signed by the party against whom the waiver or relinquishment is sought to be enforced.

13. Notices

Any notice or other communication to a party required or permitted hereunder shall be in a writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given when received by the party (regardless of the method of delivery), or if sent by registered or certified mail, postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the party as follows, on the third business day after mailing:

(a)

If to Employer:

3130 Gateway Drive  
  
Norcross, GA 30071  
  
(b)

If to Employee:

10 Homecrest Terrace  
  
Halifax, NS B3N1Y4  
  
or in each case to such other address as the party may time to time designate in writing to the other party.

14. Governing Law 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.

15. Enforcement

In the event of any breach or threatened breach by Employee of any covenant contained in Sections 9 or 10 hereof, the resulting injuries to the Company would be difficult or impossible to estimate accurately, even though irreparable injury or damages would certainly result. Accordingly, an award of legal damages, if without other relief, would be inadequate to protect the Company. Employee, therefore, agrees that in the event of any such breach, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction an injunction to restrain the breach or anticipated breach of any such covenant, and to obtain any other available legal, equitable, statutory or contractual relief. Should the Company have cause to seek such relief, no bond shall be required from the Company, and Employee shall pay all attorney’s fees and court costs which the Company may incur to the extent the Company prevails in its enforcement action.

16. Entire Agreement; Modification and Amendment 

This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements between the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein, and any such prior agreement shall, from and after the date hereof, be null and void. This Agreement and the attached Schedules shall not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

17. Parties Benefited

This Agreement shall insure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, Employee, his heirs, executors and administrators, and Employer, its subsidiaries, affiliates and successors.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first mentioned above.
