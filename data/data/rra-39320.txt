(b) Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses associated with each registration, including filing and printing fees, the Company’s counsel and accounting fees and expenses, costs associated with clearing the Registrable Securities for sale under applicable state securities laws, listing fees, but excluding discounts, commissions, fees of underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers or similar securities industry professionals fees and other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel to the Investors which shall not exceed $10,000) incurred by the Investors in connection with the registration with respect to the Registrable Securities being sold (the “Registration Expenses”).

(c) Effectiveness.

(i) The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify the Investors by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours, after any Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide the Investors with copies of any related Prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby. 

(ii) For not more than twenty (20) consecutive days or for a total of not more than forty-five (45) days in any twelve (12) month period, the Company may delay the disclosure of material non-public information concerning the Company, by suspending the use of any Prospectus included in any registration contemplated by this Section containing such information, the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith opinion of the Company, in the best interests of the Company (an “Allowed Delay”); provided, however, that the Company may suspend the use of any Prospectus included in any registration contemplated by this Section, and such suspension shall not be included in the number of days constituting an Allowed Delay, for a period commencing on the date that the Company publicly announces its quarterly or annual earnings and ending on the date that the SEC declares effective a post-effective amendment to the related Registration Statement including updated financial statements reflecting such earnings (an “Update Delay”). Upon the occurrence of an Allowed Delay or an Update Delay that the Company shall promptly (a) notify the Investors in writing of the existence of an Allowed Delay or an Update Delay (but in no event, without the prior written consent of an Investor, shall the Company disclose to such Investor any of the facts or circumstances regarding) material non-public information giving rise to an Allowed Delay, (b) advise the Investors in writing to cease all sales under the Registration Statement until the end of the Allowed Delay or Update Delay and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate an Allowed Delay or Update Delay as promptly as practicable. The Allowed Delay and the Update Delay are referred to hereinafter collectively as the “Suspension Period”.

(d) Additional Interest. If:

  


(i) a Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities is not filed with the SEC on or before October 16, 2006, 

-3-

* * *

  


(ii) a Registration Statement is filed and declared effective but, during the Effectiveness Period, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without such disability being cured within ten Business Days by an effective post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that cures such failure; or 

  


(iii) Suspension Periods exceed an aggregate of 60 days in any 360-day period (each such event referred to in foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), a “Registration Default”), 

  


then the Company will make pro rata payments to each Investor, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, in an amount equal to 2.0% of the portion of Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) paid by each Investor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default has been cured, accruing during the period during which a Registration Default shall have occurred and be continuing (the “Blackout Period”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be liable for liquidated damages in excess of 10% of the Purchase Price. Such payments shall constitute the Investors’ exclusive monetary remedy for such events, but shall not affect the right of the Investors to seek injunctive relief. The amounts payable as liquidated damages pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid monthly within three (3) Business Days of the last day of each month following the commencement of the Blackout Period until the termination of the Blackout Period. Such payments shall be made to each Investor in cash.

  


(e) Company Registration. 

  


(i) If at any time or from time to time the Company shall determine to register any of its securities, either for its own account or the account of any stockholder, in an underwritten public offering, the Company will:

  


(A) promptly give to each Investor written notice thereof and of each such Investor’s rights under this Section; and

  


(B) use commercially reasonable efforts to include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the Registrable Securities specified in a written request or requests, made within ten (10) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company, by any Investor, subject to Section(e)(ii).

-4-

* * *

  


(ii) The right of any Investor to registration pursuant to Section 2(e)(i) shall be conditioned upon such Investor’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Investors proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Company) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2(e), if the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may limit the Registrable Securities and other securities to be distributed through such underwriting, provided, that the Company shall include in such registration (a) first, one hundred percent (100%) of the securities the Company proposes to sell, and (b) second, the amount of Registrable Securities which the Investors have requested to be included in such registration, such amount to be allocated pro rata among all requesting Investors on the basis of the relative amount of Registrable Securities then held by each such Investor together with other holders of rights similar to those granted in this Agreement on a pari passu basis. The Company shall so advise all Investors distributing their securities through such underwriting of such limitation, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all Investors in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of Registrable Securities held by such Investors at the time of filing the Registration Statement or in such other manner as shall be agreed to by the Company and holders of a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities proposed to be included in such registration. To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company may round the number of shares allocated to any Investor or other selling stockholder to the nearest one hundred (100) shares. If any Investor does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such Investor shall be excluded therefrom by written notice from the Company or the underwriter. Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. If shares are so withdrawn from the registration and if the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration was previously reduced as a result of marketing factors, the Company shall then offer to all Investors who have retained the right to include securities in the registration the right to include additional securities in the registration in an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares so withdrawn, with such shares to be allocated among the persons requesting additional inclusion in accordance with this Section 2(e)(ii). The registrations provided for in this Section 2(e) are in addition to, and not in lieu of the registrations made on behalf of the Investors as described elsewhere in this Section 2.

  


(iii) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2(e) prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Investor has elected to include securities in such registration. The Registration Expenses of the Investors relating to such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company.

  


3. Company Obligations. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms hereof, and pursuant thereto the Company will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) cause such Registration Statement to become effective and to remain continuously effective for a period that will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement as amended from time to time, have been sold, and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) (the “Effectiveness Period”) and advise the Investors in writing when the Effectiveness Period has expired;

-5-

* * *

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the distribution of all of the Registrable Securities covered thereby;

(c) provide copies to and permit counsel designated by the Investors to review each Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto no fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to their filing with the SEC and not file any document to which such counsel reasonably objects;

(d) furnish to the Investors and their legal counsel (i) promptly after the same is prepared and publicly distributed, filed with the SEC, or received by the Company (but not later than two (2) Business Days after the filing date, receipt date or sending date, as the case may be) one (1) copy of any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, each preliminary prospectus and Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto, and (ii) such number of copies of a Prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, and all amendments and supplements thereto and such other documents as each Investor may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Investor that are covered by the related Registration Statement;

(e) use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness and, (ii) if such order is issued, obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment;

(f) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, register or qualify or cooperate with the Investors and their counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions requested by the Investors and do any and all other commercially reasonable acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the distribution in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement;

(g) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange, interdealer quotation system or other market on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

(h) immediately notify the Investors, at any time prior to the end of the Effectiveness Period, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the Prospectus includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly prepare, file with the SEC and furnish to such Investor a supplement to or an amendment of such Prospectus as may be necessary so that such Prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; and

(i) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 172 under the Securities Act, file any final Prospectus, including any supplement or amendment thereof, with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, promptly inform the Investors in writing if, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172 and, as a result thereof, the Investors are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with any disposition of Registrable Securities and take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the registration of the Registrable Securities hereunder; and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the Availability Date (as defined below), an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve (12) months, beginning after the effective date of each Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, including Rule 158 promulgated thereunder (for the purpose of this subsection 3(i), “Availability Date” means the 45th day following the end of the fourth fiscal quarter that includes the effective date of such Registration Statement, except that, if such fourth fiscal quarter is the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year, “Availability Date” means the 90th day after the end of such fourth fiscal quarter).

(j) With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule 144 (or its successor rule) and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investors to sell shares of Common Stock to the public without registration, the Company covenants and agrees to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, until the earlier of (A) six months after such date as all of the Registrable Securities may be resold pursuant to Rule 144(k) or any other rule of similar effect or (B) such date as all of the Registrable Securities shall have been resold; (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and (iii) furnish to each Investor upon request, as long as such Investor owns any Registrable Securities, (A) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, (B) a copy of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-KSB or Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB, and (C) such other information as may be reasonably requested in order to avail such Investor of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such Registrable Securities without registration.

The Company shall make available, during normal business hours, for inspection and review by the Investors, advisors to and representatives of the Investors (who may or may not be affiliated with the Investors and who are reasonably acceptable to the Company), all financial and other records, all filings with the SEC, and all other corporate documents and properties of the Company as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of such review, and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees, promptly, to supply all such information reasonably requested by the Investors or any such representative, advisor or underwriter in connection with such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, in response to all questions and other inquiries reasonably made or submitted by any of them), prior to and from time to time after the filing and effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the sole purpose of enabling the Investors and such representatives, advisors and underwriters and their respective accountants and attorneys to conduct initial and ongoing due diligence with respect to the Company and the accuracy of such Registration Statement.

* * *

The Company shall not disclose material nonpublic information to the Investors, or to advisors to or representatives of the Investors, unless prior to disclosure of such information the Company identifies such information as being material nonpublic information and provides the Investors, such advisors and representatives with the opportunity to accept or refuse to accept such material nonpublic information for review and any Investor wishing to obtain such information enters into an appropriate confidentiality agreement with the Company with respect thereto.

5. Obligations of the Investors.

(a) Each Investor shall furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of any Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor of the information the Company requires from such Investor if such Investor elects to have any of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement. An Investor shall provide such information to the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement if such Investor elects to have any of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement. The Company shall not have any obligation hereunder with respect to Registrable Securities held by an Investor that does not comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(b) Each Investor, by its acceptance of the Registrable Securities agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of a Registration Statement hereunder, unless such Investor has notified the Company in writing of its election to exclude all of its Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement.

(c) Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of either (i) the commencement of an Allowed Delay or an Update Delay pursuant to Section 2(c)(ii) or (ii) the happening of an event pursuant to Section 3(h) hereof, such Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities, until the Investor is advised by the Company that such dispositions may again be made.

6. Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Investor and its officers, directors, members, employees and agents, successors and assigns, and each other person, if any, who controls such Investor within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof; (ii) any blue sky application or other document executed by the Company specifically for that purpose or based upon written information furnished by the Company filed in any state or other jurisdiction in order to qualify any or all of the Registrable Securities under the securities laws thereof; (iii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (iv) any violation by the Company or its agents of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act applicable to the Company or its agents and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with such registration; or (v) any failure to register or qualify the Registrable Securities included in any such Registration in any state where the Company or its agents has affirmatively undertaken or agreed in writing that the Company will undertake such registration or qualification on an Investor’s behalf and will reimburse such Investor, and each such officer, director or member and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such Investor or any such controlling person in writing specifically for use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus.

-8-

* * *

(b) Indemnification by the Investors. Each Investor agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors, officers, employees, stockholders and each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expense (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by such Investor to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto. In no event shall the liability of an Investor be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of all expense paid by such Investor in connection with any claim relating to this Section 6 and the amount of any damages such Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission) received by such Investor upon the sale of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest exists between such person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person); and provided, further, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or litigation. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party will, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.

-9-

* * *

(d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless, other than as expressly specified therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In no event shall the contribution obligation of an Investor be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of all expenses paid by such Investor in connection with any claim relating to this Section 6 and the amount of any damages such Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission) received by it upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation.
