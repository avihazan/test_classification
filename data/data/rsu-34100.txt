The following provisions are hereby incorporated into, and are hereby made a part of, that certain Stock Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) by and between Rubio’s Restaurants, Inc. (the “Corporation”) and  (“Optionee”) evidencing the stock option (the “Option”) granted this day to Optionee under the terms of the Corporation’s 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, and such provisions are effective immediately. All capitalized terms in this Addendum, to the extent not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Option Agreement.

INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION FOLLOWING

CORPORATE TRANSACTION/CHANGE IN CONTROL

1. To the extent the Option is, in connection with a Corporate Transaction, to be assumed in accordance with Paragraph 6 of the Option Agreement, the Option shall not accelerate upon the occurrence of that Corporate Transaction, and the Option shall accordingly continue, over Optionee’s period of Service after the Corporate Transaction, to become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments in accordance with the provisions of the Option Agreement. However, immediately upon an Involuntary Termination of Optionee’s Service within eighteen (18) months following such Corporate Transaction, the assumed Option, to the extent outstanding at the time but not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall become immediately exercisable for all the Option Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully vested shares.

2. The Option shall not accelerate upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, and the Option shall, over Optionee’s period of Service following such Change in Control, continue to become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments in accordance with the provisions of the Option Agreement. However, immediately upon an Involuntary Termination of Optionee’s Service within eighteen (18) months following the Change in Control, the Option, to the extent outstanding at the time but not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall become immediately exercisable for all the Option Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully vested shares.

3. The Option as accelerated pursuant to this Addendum shall remain so exercisable until the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date or (ii) the expiration of the one (1)-year period measured from the date of the Optionee’s Involuntary Termination.

(A) the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any person or related group of persons (other than the Corporation or a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Corporation) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of securities possessing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Corporation’s outstanding securities pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Corporation’s stockholders, or
