BYLAWS

OF

ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION

ARTICLE I 

SHARES

Section 1. Certificates. All shares issued by the Corporation shall, when fully paid, be represented by certificates in such form as may be required by law and approved by the board of directors. Share certificates shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article, be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or any other officer authorized by resolution of the board of directors. Each share certificate may, but need not, be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof. 

Section 2. Signatures. The signatures of the officers upon a share certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent, or registered by a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation. If any person who signed, either manually or by facsimile, a share certificate no longer holds office when such certificate is issued, the certificate is nevertheless valid. 

Section 3. Duplicate Certificates. In case of the loss, mutilation or destruction of a share certificate, a duplicate may be issued upon such terms, and bearing such legend, if any, as the board of directors may lawfully prescribe. 

Section 4. Transfer of Shares. A transfer of shares shall be made on the share transfer books of the Corporation only upon surrender of the certificates representing the shares transferred, endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment signed by the holder of record or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. The board of directors may from time to time make such reasonable regulations governing the transfer of shares as it may deem necessary or proper. 

Section 5. Restrictions on Transfer. A transfer of shares shall be made only in accordance with any provisions of the articles of incorporation or these bylaws or an agreement among the shareholders or between the shareholders and the Corporation that imposes restrictions on the transfer of shares. 

ARTICLE II 

SHAREHOLDERS

Section 1. Holders of Shares. Only shareholders of record on the share transfer books of the Corporation shall be entitled to be treated by the Corporation as the holders of the shares standing in their respective names, and, except to the extent, if any, required 

3 

* * *

##### 

by law, the Corporation shall not be obligated to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in any share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice hereof. 

Section 2. Meetings Generally. Meetings of shareholders shall be held at the registered office or the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, as the board of directors may designate from time to time. At least ten days before each meeting, the officer or agent having charge of the share transfer books of the Corporation shall prepare a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, with the address and number of shares held by each, arranged by voting group and within each voting group by class or series of shares. For a period of ten days prior to the meeting the list of shareholders kept on file at the registered office or the principal office of the Corporation or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar shall be subject to inspection by any shareholders at any time during usual business hours. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof. 

Section 3. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held on the second Thursday in May of each year or on such other day set by the board of directors for the purpose of electing directors and transacting such other business as may properly come before the meeting. 

Section 4. Notice. Written notice of the date, time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting (or if required by law, the articles of incorporation or these bylaws), the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting. Such notice shall be given either by personal delivery or by mail, by or at the direction of the officer or persons calling the meeting, not more than 60 days nor less than ten days before the date of the meeting (except that such notice shall be given to each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, not less than 25 days before a meeting called to act on an amendment to the articles of incorporation, a plan of merger or share exchange, a proposed sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property of the Corporation other than in the usual and regular course of business, or the dissolution of the Corporation, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed amendment, plan of merger or share exchange, agreement of sale or plan of dissolution, as the case may be). Notice to a shareholder shall be deemed given when mailed postage prepaid, correctly addressed, to the shareholder at his address as shown in the current record of shareholders of the Corporation. 

A shareholder’s attendance at a meeting waives objection to: (i) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless at the beginning of the meeting he objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (ii) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the notice of the meeting, unless he objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

##### 

Section 5. Waiver of Notice. Notice of any meeting may be waived before or after the date and time of the meeting in a writing signed by the shareholder entitled to notice and delivered to the Secretary for inclusion in the minutes of the meeting or filing with the corporate records. 

Section 6. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted by law to be taken at a shareholders’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote thereon and delivered to the Secretary for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. 

Section 7. Determination of Shareholders of Record. The share transfer books may be closed by order of the board of directors for not more than 70 days for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders or any adjournment thereof (or entitled to receive any distribution or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other purpose). In lieu of closing such books, the board of directors may fix in advance as the record date for any such determination a date not more than 70 days before the date on which such meeting is to be held (or such distribution made or other action requiring such determination is to be taken). If the books are not thus closed or the record date is not thus fixed, the record date shall be the close of business on the day before the effective date of the notice to shareholders. 

Section 8. Conduct of Meetings. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his absence the President, shall act as chairman of and preside over meetings of the shareholders. If no such officer is present, the meeting shall elect a chairman. The Secretary, or in his absence the Assistant Secretary, shall act as the secretary of such meetings. If no such officer is present, the chairman shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. 

Section 9. Proxies. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him by signing and dating an appointment form, either personally or by his attorney-in-fact. No appointment of proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided therein. Every appointment of proxy shall be revocable by the shareholder executing it, unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and that it is coupled with an interest in accordance with law. 

Section 10. Procedure at Meetings. The procedure at meetings of the shareholders shall be determined by the chairman, and (subject to the provisions of Section 9 of this Article) the vote on all questions before any meeting shall be taken in such manner as the chairman prescribes. However, upon the demand of the holders in the aggregate of at least twenty percent of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the meeting, such vote shall be by ballot.

* * *

##### 

Section 11. Quorum and Voting. A quorum at any meeting of shareholders shall be a majority of the votes entitled to be cast, represented in person or by proxy. If a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved by a majority of the votes cast within the voting group, unless a greater vote is required by law or the articles of incorporation (except that in elections of directors those receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected even though less than a majority). 

Section 12. Adjournments. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast at any meeting, represented in person or by proxy, even though less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting to a fixed time and place. If a meeting of the shareholders is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of the original meeting. If a meeting is adjourned for less than 120 days, no notice of the date, time or place of the adjourned meeting or, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, need be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, prior to such adjournment. If a quorum shall be present at any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted if a quorum had been present at the meeting as originally called. 

ARTICLE III 

DIRECTORS

Section 1. General Powers. Except as expressly provided in the articles of incorporation or these bylaws, all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation managed under the direction of, the board of directors. 

Section 2. Number and Qualifications. The board of directors shall consist of a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of fifteen (15) individuals. No director may be nominated for election or elected if on the date of his election he has or would have attained the age of 70 years. Directors need not be residents of Virginia or shareholders of the Corporation. Consistent with their terms, directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the shareholders and may be elected at any special meeting of the shareholders. 

Section 3. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at the registered office or principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, as the board of directors may designate from time to time. A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be held as soon as practicable after each annual meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of appointing officers and transacting such other business as may properly come before the meeting. 

Section 4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the board of directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or any two (2) of the directors.

* * *

##### 

Section 5. Notice. Written notice of the date, time and place of special meetings shall be given to each director either by personal delivery or by mail, by or at the direction of the officer or directors calling the meeting, to the address of such director as it appears in the records of the Corporation not less than five days before the date of the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the board of directors need be specified in the notice or any waiver of notice of such meeting. 

A director’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him of the meeting unless he at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to the action taken at the meeting. 

Section 6. Waiver of Notice. Notice of any meeting may be waived before or after the date and time of the meeting in a writing signed by the director entitled to notice and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes of the meeting or filing with the corporate records. 

Section 7. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted by law to be taken at a meeting of the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all of the members of the board of directors. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents stating the action taken, signed by each director either before or after the action taken, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. 

Section 8. Conduct of Meetings. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his absence the President, shall act as chairman of and preside over meetings of the board of directors. If no such officer is present, the meeting shall elect a chairman. The Secretary, or in his absence the Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of such meetings. If no such officer is present, the chairman shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. 

Section 9. Procedure at Meetings. The procedure at meetings of the board of directors shall be determined by the chairman, and (subject to the provisions of Section 18 of this Article) the vote on all matters before any meeting shall be taken in such manner as the chairman may prescribe. 

Section 10. Participation by Conference Telephone. The board of directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a meeting of the directors by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, conference telephone or any other means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by such means shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting. When a meeting is so conducted, a written record shall be made of the action taken at such meeting. 

Section 11. Quorum. A quorum at any meeting of the board of directors shall be a majority of the number of directors fixed or prescribed by these bylaws or, if no number is prescribed, the number of directors in office immediately before the meeting begins. 

7

The affirmative vote of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors. 

Section 12. Committees. The board of directors may create one or more committees and appoint two or more members of the board of directors to serve on them at the pleasure of the board of directors. Any such committee, to the extent specified by the board of directors, may exercise the authority that may be exercised by the board of directors except to the extent prohibited or restricted by law, the articles of incorporation or these bylaws. 

The provisions of Sections 3 through 11 of this Article, which provide for, among other things, meetings, action without meetings, notice and waiver of notice, quorum and voting requirements of the board of directors, shall apply to committees and their members as well. 

Section 13. Staggered Terms. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible. Directors of the first class (Class I) shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 2003 annual meeting of the shareholders; directors of the second class (Class II) shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2004 annual meeting of the shareholders, and directors of the third class (Class III) shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders. The successors to the class of directors whose terms expire shall be identified as being of the same class as the directors they succeed and elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. When the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be apportioned among the classes by the Board of Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The classes into which the directors will be divided are as follows:   
  
Class I 

Class II  Class III  
Serving until 2003  Serving until 2004  Serving until 2005  
Michael W. Clarke  Robert C. Shoemaker  Jacques Rebibo

J. Randolph Babbitt  
  
Section 14. Resignation. A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary. A resignation shall be effective when delivered, unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 

Section 15. Removal. Directors of the Corporation may be removed only with cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

Section 16. Vacancies. If the office of any director shall become vacant, the directors at the time in office, whether or not a quorum, may, by majority vote of the directors then in office, choose a successor who shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders. In such event, the successor elected by the shareholders at that annual meeting shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of the class of directors to which that person has been elected. Vacancies resulting from the increase in the number of directors shall be filled in the same manner. 

Section 17. Nominations of Director Candidates. The Board of Directors may nominate directors by resolution at any time prior to solicitation of proxies for the annual meeting of shareholders. Any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting, but only if written notice of such shareholder’s intent to make such nomination(s) has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not less than thirty (30) days prior to the first anniversary date of the initial notice given to shareholders of record on the record date for the previous annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required to be given more than ninety (90) days prior to the annual meeting of shareholders. Each such notice of a shareholder’s intention to make nomination(s) shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination of the person(s) and of the person(s) to be nominated; (b) a representation that the shareholder is the owner of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person(s) specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee for director and any other person(s) (naming such person(s)) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information regarding such nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors, including, but not limited to, the amount and nature of his beneficial ownership of the Corporation’s securities, his principal occupation for the past five years and his age; and (e) the written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected. The presiding officer at any meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing sentence. 

Section 18. Conflicts of Interest. No transaction with the Corporation in which a director has a direct or indirect personal interest shall be void or voidable solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if: (i) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest are disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors, and the transaction was authorized, approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect personal interest in the transaction; provided, however, that a transaction shall not be authorized, approved or ratified by a single director; or (ii) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest are disclosed to the shareholders entitled to vote, and the transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the vote of a majority of the shares other than shares owned by or voted 

9

under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction; or (iii) the transaction is fair to the Corporation.
