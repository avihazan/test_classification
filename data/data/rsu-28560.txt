Exhibit 10.39 

THERMA-WAVE, INC.



(Nonqualified Stock Option)

THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of ____________, 2002 by and between Therma-Wave, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the employee of the Company listed on the signature page hereto ("Optionee").

Pursuant to the Company's 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company and the Optionee desire to enter into an agreement to evidence the grant by the Company to the Optionee of an option (the "Option") to acquire that number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") listed on the signature page hereto (the "Option Shares"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are defined in Section 6 hereof.

The parties hereto agree as follows:

  1. Option Grant. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee, pursuant to the Plan, an Option to purchase the Option Shares at a price per share equal to that amount listed on the signature page hereto (the "Exercise Price"). The Exercise Price and the number of Option Shares will be equitably adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification or recapitalization of the Company which occurs subsequent to the date of this Agreement. The Option is not intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422A of the Code.
  2. Exercise of Option.
    1. Normal Vesting. The Option granted hereunder may be exercised only to the extent it has become vested. The Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to the following number of Option Shares (set forth on a cumulative basis): (i) 25% of the Option Shares on the first year anniversary of the Grant Date; (ii) 2.083% of the Option Shares each month on the thirteenth (13th) through the forty eighth (48th) monthly anniversary of the Grant Date (each a "Vesting Date"), if and only if the Optionee is, and has been, continuously employed by the Company from the Grant Date through the applicable Vesting Date.
    2. No Vesting After Termination Date. The Option shall cease to vest after the Termination Date. Any portion of the Option which has vested and become exercisable prior to the Termination Date shall remain exercisable for the period set forth in Section 3.
    3. Procedure for Exercise. At any time prior to the Expiration Date, Optionee may exercise all or a portion of the Option (to the extent vested), which has not expired pursuant to subsection 3(b) below by delivering written notice of exercise to the Company, together with (i) a written acknowledgment that Optionee has read and has been afforded an opportunity to ask questions of members of the Company's management regarding all financial and other information provided to Optionee regarding the Company and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of payment in cash, check, other shares of capital stock of the Company or any combination of the foregoing. As a condition to any exercise of the Option, Optionee will permit the Company to deliver to him all financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries which it believes necessary to enable Optionee to make an informed investment decision. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse.
  3. Expiration of Option.
    1. Normal Expiration. In no event shall any part of the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date.
    2. Expiration Upon Termination of Employment. Any portion of the Option that was not vested and exercisable on the Termination Date shall expire on such date and may not be exercised thereafter under any circumstance. Any portion of the Option that was vested and exercisable on the Termination Date shall expire on the earlier of (i) three months after the Termination Date (or 12 months after the Termination Date if the termination was caused by Optionee's death, disability or retirement) and (ii) the Expiration Date and may not be exercised thereafter under any circumstance.
    3. Non-Transferability of Option. The Option is personal to Optionee and is not transferable by Optionee except pursuant to the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.
  4. Adjustments upon Dissolution, Merger or Asset Sale.
    1. Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Board shall notify each Optionee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
    2. Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Option and shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Option Shares, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable.
  5. Definition of Option Shares. For all purposes of this Agreement, Option Shares will continue to be Option Shares in the hands of any holder other than Optionee (except for the Company, purchasers pursuant to an offering registered under the 1933 Act and subsequent transferees), and each such other holder of Option Shares will succeed to all rights and obligations attributable to Optionee as a holder of Option Shares hereunder.
