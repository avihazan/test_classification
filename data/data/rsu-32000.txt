have been held by the Optionee for at least six months at the time of tender); or  
(iii) The Optionee may tender payment of the Option Price on the date of exercise in a combination of (A) shares of Common Stock (subject to the holding period described in paragraph (ii) above); and (B) cash, certified check, bank draft, or postal or express money order made payable to the order of the Company and denominated in U.S. dollars, equal to the difference between the Option Price and the Fair Market Value of the tendered shares of Common Stock on the date of exercise.
