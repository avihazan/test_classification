(a) Each Installment which is not yet exercisable as of the date of Optionee’s termination (the “Termination Date”) shall expire on the Termination Date; and

  


(b) Each Installment which is exercisable as of the Termination Date shall expire 90 days after the Termination Date.

  


6\. Securities Laws Requirements. No Option Share shall be issued unless and until, in the opinion of the Company, there has been full compliance with any applicable registration require­ments of the Securities Act of 1933, any applicable listing requirements of any securities exchange on which stock of the same class has been listed, and any other requirements of law or any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery. Pursuant to the terms of the Notice And Agreement Of Exercise Of Option (Exhibit A) that shall be delivered to the Company upon each exercise of the Option, the Optionee shall acknowledge, represent, warrant and agree as follows:

  


* * *

(a) All Option Shares shall be acquired solely for the account of the Optionee for investment purposes only and with no view to their resale or other distribution of any kind (Note: This provision will be applicable only if the issuance of the Option Shares is not registered at the time of exercise of the Options);

  


(b) No Option Share shall be sold or otherwise dis­trib­uted in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or any other applicable federal or state securities laws;

  


(c) The Optionee shall report all sales of Option Shares to the Company in writing on a form prescribed by the Company; and

  


(d) If and so long as the Optionee is subject to reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), he shall (i) be aware that any sale by him or his immediate family of shares of the Company's common stock or any of the Option Shares within six months before or after any transaction deemed to be a "purchase" of an equity security of the Company may create liability for him under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, (ii) consult with his counsel regarding the application of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act prior to any exercise of the Options, and prior to any sale of shares of the Company's common stock or the Option Shares, (iii) furnish the Company with a copy of each Form 4 and Form 5 filed by him, and (iv) timely file all reports required under the federal securities laws.

  


(e) No Option Shares may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of prior to six months from the Date of Grant.

  


The restrictions described in Sections 6(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) above, or notice thereof, may be placed on the certificates representing the Option Shares purchased, and the Company may refuse to issue the certificates or to transfer the shares on its books unless it is satisfied that no violation of such restrictions will occur.

  


7\. Transferability. The Option shall not be transferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or involun­tarily, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, any attempt to transfer the Option shall void the Option.

  


8\. Adjustment By Stock Split, Stock Dividend, Etc. If at any time the Company increases or decreases the number of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, or changes in any way the rights and privileges of such shares, by means of the payment of a stock dividend or the making of any other distribution on such shares payable in its Common Stock, or through a stock split or subdivision of shares, or a consolidation or combination of shares, or through a reclassification or recapitalization involving its Common Stock, the numbers, rights and privileges of the shares of Common Stock included in the Option shall be increased, decreased or changed in like manner as if such shares had been issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, at the time of such occurrence, and the Option Price shall be adjusted accordingly.

  


* * *

9\. Common Stock To Be Received Upon Exercise. Optionee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the issuance of the Option Shares, the resale of the Option Shares, or the Option Shares, under the Securities Act of l933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and that in the absence of any such registration, the Option Shares cannot be sold unless they are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company is under no obligation to comply, or to assist the Optionee in complying, with any exemption from such registration requirement, including supplying the Optionee with any infor­mation necessary to permit routine sales of the Option Shares under Rule l44 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Optionee also understands that with respect to Rule l44, routine sales of securities made in reliance upon such Rule can be made only in limited amounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Rule, and that in cases in which the Rule is inapplicable, compliance with another exemption under the Securities Act will be required. Thus, the Option Shares will have to be held indefinitely in the absence of registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration.

  


10\. Privilege Of Ownership. Optionee shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares covered by the Options except to the extent that one or more certificates for such shares shall be delivered to him upon exercise of the Options.

  


11\. Notices. Any notices and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be deemed to have been given to a party on the date of service if delivered personally, if delivered to the address designated below, or if delivered by facsimile to the number designated below, or shall be deemed to have been given on the fifth day after mailing by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, if mailed to the party to whom notice is to be given, and shall be addressed as follows:

(b)

if to the Optionee:

At the address listed below his/her name on the last page of this Agreement.  
  
  


Any party may change its address for purposes of this Section 11 by giving the other parties written notice of the new address in the manner set forth above.

  


12\. No Employment Right. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered to confer on the Optionee any right to continue in the Company’s employ or to limit the Company’s right to terminate the Optionee’s employment.

  


13\. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. This Option is subject to, and the Company and the Optionee agree to be bound by, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan under which this Option was granted, as the same shall have been amended from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Pursuant to the Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company, or its Committee established for such purposes is vested with final authority to interpret and construe the Plan or this Option, and is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for carrying out the Plan. A copy of the Plan in its present form is available for inspection during business hours by the Optionee at the Company’s principal office.

  


* * *

14\. General Provisions. This instrument (a) contains the entire agreement between the parties, (b) may not be amended nor may any rights hereunder be waived except by an instrument in writing signed by the party sought to be charged with such amendment or waiver, (c) shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of Colorado, and (d) shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective personal representatives and assigns, except as above set forth. All pronouns contained herein and any vari­ations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural as the identity of the parties hereto may require.

  


15\. Effective Date. This Agreement shall not become effective until the Optionee accepts this Agreement by returning a copy to the Company completed and signed below by the Optionee and, if the Optionee is married, by the Optionee’s spouse. When the Optionee so accepts this Agreement, this Agreement shall become effective retroactive to the Date of Grant without the necessity of further action by either the Company or the Optionee.
