Restricted Stock Award Agreement

  


Restricted Stock Terms and Conditions

  
  
  
1.

Award of Restricted Stock. The Company hereby confirms the grant to you, as of the Grant Date, of the number of Restricted Shares identified on the cover page of this Agreement, subject to the restrictions and other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
2.

Delivery of Restricted Shares. As soon as practicable after the Grant Date, the Company will issue one or more certificates for, or cause its transfer agent to maintain a book entry account reflecting the issuance of, the Restricted Shares in your name. The Secretary of the Company, or the Company's transfer agent, will hold the certificates for the Restricted Shares, or cause such Restricted Shares to be maintained as restricted shares in a book entry account, until the Restricted Shares either vest as provided in Section 4 or are forfeited as provided in Section 6. Any certificate(s) issued for Restricted Shares will bear an appropriate legend referring to the restricted nature of the Restricted Shares evidenced thereby, and any book entry accounts that reflect the issuance of such Restricted Shares will be accompanied by a comparable notation regarding applicable restrictions. Your right to receive this Restricted Stock Award is conditioned upon your execution and delivery to the Company of all stock powers or other instruments of assignment that may be necessary to permit transfer to the Company of all or a portion of the Restricted Shares if such Restricted Shares are forfeited in whole or in part.   
  
  


3. Applicable Restrictions.

  


(a) Beginning on the Grant Date, you shall have all rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Shares except as follows (the “Restrictions”):

  
  
  
(i)

dividends and other distributions declared and paid with respect to the Restricted Shares before they vest shall be subject to Paragraph 3(c);  
  
  
  
  
(ii)

none of the Restricted Shares may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of before they vest other than a transfer upon your death in accordance with your will, by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a beneficiary designation submitted in accordance with Section 6(d) of the Plan; and  
  
  
  
  
(iii)

all or a portion of the Restricted Shares may be forfeited in accordance with Section 6.  
  
  


(b) Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Shares in a manner contrary to the Restrictions shall be void and of no effect. 

  


(c) If the Company declares and pays a dividend or other distribution on its common stock, the Company shall retain custody of all such dividends and distributions made or declared with respect to any unvested Restricted Shares. The Company shall not be required to segregate any such retained dividends or distributions. At the time Restricted Shares vest, the Company shall pay to you (without interest) the portion of such retained dividends and distributions that relate to the Restricted Shares that vest.

  
  
  
4.

Vesting Schedule. The Restrictions will lapse and the Restricted Shares will vest and become non-forfeitable, in the amounts and on the dates specified in the Vesting Schedule on the cover page to this Agreement, so long as your Service to the Company and its Affiliates has not previously ended. The vesting of the Restricted Shares may be accelerated under the circumstances described in Section 12 of the Plan, and at the discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 3(b)(2) of the Plan, except as otherwise provided for in the Employment Agreement.

5.

Release of Unrestricted Shares. Upon the vesting of Restricted Shares and the corresponding lapse of the Restrictions, and after the Company has determined that all conditions to the release of unrestricted Shares, including Section 8 of this Agreement, have been satisfied, it shall release to you the unrestricted Shares, as evidenced by issuance of a stock certificate without restrictive legend, by electronic delivery of such Shares to a brokerage account designated by you, or by an unrestricted book-entry registration of such Shares with the Company’s transfer agent.   
  
  
  
  
6.

Termination of Service. If your Service to the Company and its Affiliates is terminated before all of the Restricted Shares have vested, you will immediately forfeit all unvested Restricted Shares, which shall be returned to the Company, except as otherwise provided for in the Employment Agreement.   
  
  
  
  
7.

83(b) Election. You may make and file with the Internal Revenue Service an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the grant of the Restricted Shares hereunder, electing to include in your gross income as of the Grant Date the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Shares as of the Grant Date. You shall promptly provide a copy of such election to the Company. If you make and file such an election, you shall make such arrangements in accordance with Section 8 as are satisfactory to the Committee to provide for the timely payment of all applicable withholding taxes.  
  
  
  
  
8.

Withholding Taxes. You hereby authorize the Company (or any Affiliate) to withhold from payroll or other amounts payable to you any sums required to satisfy any federal, state, local or foreign withholding taxes that may be due as a result of the receipt or vesting of Restricted Shares, and the Company may defer the release to you of any and all unrestricted Shares until you have made arrangements acceptable to the Company for payment of all such withholding taxes in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 of the Plan. If you wish to satisfy some or all of such withholding tax obligations by delivering Shares you already own or by having the Company retain a portion of the unrestricted Shares that would otherwise be released to you, you must make such a request which shall be subject to approval by the Company.
