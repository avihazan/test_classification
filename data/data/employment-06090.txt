  




EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), effective as of July 1, 2010 (“Effective Date”), between Lions Gate Lighting Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and Dan Zang (the “Employee”).

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to employ the Employee in the position set forth below, and the Employee desires to serve in that capacity.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the Company and Employee hereby agree as follows:

1\.  Employment Period. The Company shall employ the Employee, and the Employee shall serve the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period commencing on the date of the Shell Merger and ending three years after such date (the “Initial Term” and, together with any subsequent term of Employment, the “Employment Period”). The term of employment hereunder will automatically be renewed for successive one-year terms (each such term a “Renewal Term”) unless either party shall, at least 90 days before the last day of the Employment Period, provide written notice to the other party that the Employment Period will not be extended.

2\. Position, Duties and Location.

(a) The Employee shall serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, reporting to the Board, with such duties and responsibilities as are customarily assigned to such position and such other duties and responsibilities not inconsistent therewith as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board.

(b) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Employee is entitled, the Employee shall devote his full-time efforts to the business and affairs of the Company and use his best efforts to carry out such responsibilities faithfully and efficiently. It shall not be considered a violation of the foregoing for the Employee to (i) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (ii) deliver lectures or fulfill speaking engagements, (iii) manage personal investments, or (iv) engage in other business activities, so long as such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of his responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

  


(c) Employee will initially be based at the Company’s U.S. headquarters in or around New York, New York (the “Initial Headquarters”); provided that the Company anticipates that its headquarters may be relocated to San Diego, California at which time Employee will be expected to move to that location.

3\. Compensation.

(a) Base Salary. During the first contract year of the Initial Term, the Employee shall receive an annual base salary (the “Annual Base Salary”) of US$179,000, which will be subject to review and change by the Board at the six month anniversary of the Effective Date. Thereafter, Employee will receive an annual salary review by the Board, or an authorized committee thereof, on or before each anniversary of the Effective Date. The Annual Base Salary shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s payroll practices as in effect from time to time. As part of the referenced annual salary review, the Board or an authorized committee thereof may increase the Annual Base Salary above the foregoing amounts at its discretion. It is understood that the Annual Base Salary includes an amount of $9,000 to cover the cost of health insurance for Employee until the Company offers its employees a Company sponsored health plan at which time the Annual Base Salary will be reduced by said amount. On the date hereof, the Employee will be granted five-year options to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $1.00 per share. Of these, options to purchase 50,000 shares will vest immediately. Options to purchase an additional 50,000 shares will vest on the first anniversary of the Effective Date. The balance will vest in two equal installments on the second and third anniversary of the Effective Date.

(b) Bonus and Other Compensation. In addition to the Annual Base Salary, the Board (or its designated compensation committee) may award Employee an annual bonus at its discretion. Employee will also be eligible to participate in the Company’s equity compensation plan, if and when adopted. Awards thereunder will be made to Employee from time to time at the discretion of the Board (or relevant committee thereof).

(c) Benefits. During the Employment Period, the Employee and the Employee’s direct family shall be entitled to participate in all benefit programs of the Company (if and when available), including, but not limited to, health insurance coverage, as well as all welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company, including, but not limited to any comprehensive dental plan, retirement plans and profit sharing programs the Company may provide to other employees from time to time.

(d) Expenses. During the Employment Period, the Employee shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Employee in carrying out the Employee’s duties under this Agreement, provided that the Employee complies with the policies, practices and procedures of the Company for submission of expense reports, receipts and similar documentation of such expenses.

  


(e) Housing and Relocation Expenses. The Company will reimburse Employee for reasonable rent paid for suitable accommodations during Employee’s work at the Initial Headquarters for a period of up to twelve (12) months.

4\. Termination of Employment.

Employee will be immediately advised of any allegations of conduct covered by clause (A) above and will be provided a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of the written notice to defend himself against such allegations and to take any appropriate remedial action. If Employee shows that the allegations are untrue or takes appropriate remedial action to address the allegations, the Company will not terminate the Employee’s employment for Cause.

The determination of whether a payment under or pursuant to this Agreement would result in Employee receiving an excess parachute payment (but for the provisions of this Section 4) shall be made by counsel for the Company.

(g) No Waiver. The failure to set forth any fact or circumstance in a Notice of Termination for Cause or a Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall not constitute a waiver of the right to assert, and shall not preclude the party giving notice from asserting, such fact or circumstance in an attempt to enforce any right under or provision of this Agreement.

Accordingly, the Employee agrees that during the Employment Period and thereafter, the Employee and his affiliates shall not, except in the performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder or as may otherwise be approved in advance by the Company, directly or indirectly, disclose or use (except for the direct benefit of the Company) any confidential information that he may learn or has learned by reason of his association with any Relevant Entity. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Employee shall promptly return to the Company any and all properties, records or papers of any Relevant Entity that may have been in his possession at the time of termination, whether prepared by the Employee or others, including, but not limited to, confidential information and keys.

For purposes of this Agreement, “affiliate” means any person or entity that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by, or under common control with another person. For purposes of this definition, the terms “controlled” and “under common control with” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting stock, by contract or otherwise.

(b) Injunction. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Employee acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this Section 7, Employer shall have no adequate remedy at law and shall therefore be entitled to enforce each such provision by temporary or permanent injunctive or mandatory relief obtained in any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving damage or posting any bond or other security, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available at law or in equity.
