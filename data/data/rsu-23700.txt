Incorporated Terms and Conditions  
  
1.

Grant of Option.  
  
This Agreement evidences the grant by the Company on the grant date (the “Grant Date”) set forth in the Notice of Grant that forms part of this Agreement (the “Notice of Grant”) to the Participant of an option to purchase, in whole or in part, on the terms provided herein and in the Company’s 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant of Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (“Common Stock”) at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant. Unless earlier terminated, this option shall expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Final Exercise Date set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Final Exercise Date”).

It is intended that the option evidenced by this Agreement shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Code”). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term “Participant”, as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms.

2. Vesting Schedule.

(a) This option is exercisable in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. This option shall expire upon, and will not be exercisable after, the Final Exercise Date. The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all Shares which are then exercisable until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan.

(b) If the Participant ceases to be an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company as defined in Section 424(e) or (f) of the Code (an “Eligible Participant”) as a result of the Participant’s (i) death or (ii) Disability, this option shall become immediately exercisable as to all of the Shares subject to this option, effective as of such cessation. The Participant shall only be entitled to exercise this option following such cessation as provided in Section 3 below.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” or “Disabled” shall have the meaning provided under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(4)(i) and (iii). 

3. Exercise of Option.

(a) Form of Exercise.

(1) in cash or by check, payable to the order of the Company;

(2) by delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a credit-worthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price, or delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a credit-worthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price, or by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant valued at their fair market value (valued in the manner determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), which Common Stock was owned by the Participant at least six months prior to such delivery; or

(3) any combination of the above permitted forms of payment.

The Participant may purchase less than the number of Shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional Share.

(b) Continuous Relationship with the Company Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Participant, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an Eligible Participant.

(c) Termination of Relationship with the Company. If the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the restrictive covenants (including, without limitation, the non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality provisions) of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation.

(d) Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability. If the Participant dies or becomes Disabled prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Participant and the Company has not terminated such relationship for Cause as specified in paragraph (e) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of death or Disability of the Participant, by the Participant (or in the case of death by an authorized transferee), provided that this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Participant on the date of his or her death or Disability, and further provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.

This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of the Participant, this option shall be exercisable only by the Participant.

6. Provisions of the Plan.
