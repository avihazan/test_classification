Except as otherwise provided herein, neither the shares nor any ownership interest therein may be sold, pledged, transferred or otherwise disposed of prior to December 31, 2013.

  


3\. Forfeiture

  


Without limiting the foregoing provisions, this paragraph sets forth certain circumstances under which this Award will be forfeited.

Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Event, the Award, if restricted at the time of a Forfeiture Event, will be forfeited and will be cancelled. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) or entire Board of Directors may waive any condition of forfeiture described in this paragraph.

  


4\. Shareholder Rights

  


Prior to the release of restrictions as set forth above, Recipient shall be entitled to all shareholder rights except the right to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares, and except that any and all dividends declared and paid with respect to restricted shares will be held by the Company in an account until release of restrictions. Interest will be credited to the account quarterly on the full amount in the account until the account is distributed. Interest shall be calculated at a rate equal to the average of the daily close of business prime rates for the quarter, as such prime rates are established by JPMorgan Chase, or such other bank as may be designated by the Committee. On the date on which restrictions are released, all dividends and interest, if any, accrued to that date with respect to the shares on which the restrictions are released will be payable to Recipient; provided that, for this purpose, to the extent necessary to avoid the adverse tax

  


* * *

  


consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), restrictions will be deemed to be released under this paragraph on account of a total and permanent disability or a Change in Control only to the extent such events occur both under the terms of this Agreement and in a manner consistent

with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Recipient is determined to be a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, for purposes of payment on termination of employment hereunder, payment shall be made on the first payroll date which is more than six months following the date of separation from service, to the extent required to avoid any adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that the restrictions are not released and the award is forfeited pursuant to Paragraph 3 above or otherwise, Recipient shall not be entitled to receive any dividends and interest which may have accrued with respect to the shares so forfeited, unless approved by the Committee or the entire Board.

  


5\. Other

  


The Company reserves the right, as determined by the Committee, to convert this Award to a substantially equivalent award and to make any other modification it may consider necessary or advisable to comply with any law or regulation. In addition, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri with reference to the conflict of laws provisions therein.

In addition to any remedies available at law, the Company shall have the right to seek and obtain any equitable and injunctive relief (without the requirement to post a bond) that a court may determine is appropriate. To the extent that the Company is successful in enforcing this provision, Recipient shall be responsible for paying the Company’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

(iii) If Recipient breaches any covenant concerning non hiring or non solicitation contained herein or to which Recipient is or may become a party in the future, then, in addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing or any other remedies:

(c) Recipient shall pay any damages in excess of the amounts paid to the Company under the foregoing.  


c. The parties acknowledge and agree that the time and other limitations contained in this Section are reasonable and necessary for the proper protection of the Company. However, if any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the time period of the foregoing covenants is too lengthy or the geographic coverage and scope of the covenants is too broad, the restrictive time period shall be deemed to comprise the largest scope permissible by law under the circumstances. Recipient further acknowledges that, in the event of the termination of his employment with the Company, Recipient’s skills and experience will permit him to find employment in many markets, and the limitations contained herein will not prevent him from earning a livelihood. The period of time applicable to any covenant in this Section shall be extended by the duration of any actual or threatened violation by Recipient of such covenant.
