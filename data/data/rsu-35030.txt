II. AGREEMENT  
  
3\. Grant of Option. The Committee hereby grants to the optionee named in the Notice of Grant in Part I of this Agreement (the “Optionee”) an option (the “Option”) to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant above, at the exercise price per share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Exercise Price”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 19 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail. 

If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option (“ISO”), this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. However, to the extent that an option designated as an ISO exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section 422(d), it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option (“NSO”). 

4\. Exercise of Option.

(a) Right to Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. 

(b) Method of Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice in the form attached as Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be completed by the Optionee and delivered to the Stock Plan Administrator. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by the Exercise Price. 

No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with any applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, any applicable listing requirement of any national securities exchange on 

2 

* * *

which stock of the same class is then listed, and any other requirements of federal, state or local law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and exercise. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Shares. 

(c) Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee: 

(1) cash or cash equivalent; or 

(2) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; or 

(3) surrender of other Shares that (i) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender and (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares. 

(d) Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment or settlement under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the exercise of this Option and the delivery of the Option Shares, any federal, state, local or other taxes that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to be withheld to comply with the Code or any other applicable law, rule or regulation. 

5\. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee. 

6\. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan and this Option Agreement. 

7\. Tax Consequences. The federal tax consequences relating to this Option are set forth below. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES. 

(a) Exercising the Option. 

(i) Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee may incur regular federal income tax liability upon the exercise of an NSO. The Optionee will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, 

3 

* * *

of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their Exercise Price. If the Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be required to withhold for income and employment tax purposes, as set forth in Section 2(d) above. 

(ii) Incentive Stock Option. If this Option qualifies as an ISO, the Optionee will have no regular federal income tax liability upon its exercise, although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to alternative minimum taxable income for federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise. In the event that the Optionee ceases to be an Employee but remains a Service Provider, any Incentive Stock Option of the Optionee that remains unexercised shall cease to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option on the date three (3) months and one (1) day following such change of status. 

(b) Disposition of Shares.

(i) NSO. If the Optionee holds NSO Shares for at least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. 

(ii) ISO. If the Optionee holds ISO Shares for at least one year after exercise and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on the disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. If the Optionee disposes of ISO Shares within one year after exercise or two years after the grant date (a “Disqualifying Disposition”), any gain realized on such disposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and the Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale price of such Shares and the Exercise Price. Any additional gain will be taxed as capital gain, short-term or long-term, depending on the period that the ISO Shares are held. 

(c) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. In the event of a Disqualifying Disposition, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. 

8\. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Optionee. Neither the Plan nor the Option Agreement may be modified adversely to the Optionee’s interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and Optionee. This Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of North Carolina. 

9\. No Guarantee of Continued Service. OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL 

4 

* * *

OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED AN OPTION OR PURCHASING SHARES HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE COMPANY’S OR THE OPTIONEE’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE OPTIONEE’S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. 

Optionee and the Company agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. Optionee has reviewed the Plan and this Option Agreement in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and Option Agreement. Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions relating to the Plan and Option Agreement.
