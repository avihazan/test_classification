If, as a result of Executive’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness (“Disability”), Executive shall have been absent from the full-time performance of Executive’s duties with the Company for a period of four (4) consecutive months and, within thirty (30) days after written notice is provided to Executive by the Company (in accordance with Section 4A hereof), Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of Executive’s duties, Executive’s employment under this Agreement may be terminated by the Company for Disability. During any period prior to such termination during which Executive is absent from the full-time performance of Executive’s duties with the Company due to Disability, the Company shall continue to pay Executive’s Base Salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of such period of Disability, offset by any amounts payable to Executive under any disability insurance plan or policy provided by the Company.

Upon the termination of Executive’s employment by the Company for Cause (as defined below), the Company shall have no further obligation hereunder, except for the payment of any Accrued Obligations (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below). As used herein, “Cause” shall mean: (i) the plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or conviction for, the commission of a felony offense by Executive; provided, however, that after indictment, the Company may suspend Executive from the rendition of services, but without limiting or modifying in any other way the Company’s obligations under this Agreement; provided, further, that Executive’s employment shall be immediately reinstated if the indictment is dismissed or otherwise dropped and there is not otherwise grounds to terminate Executive’s employment for Cause; (ii) a material breach by Executive of a fiduciary duty owed to the Company, provided that the Reporting Officer determines, in his/her good faith discretion, that such material breach undermines his/her confidence in Executive’s fitness to continue in his position, as evidenced in writing from the Reporting Officer (it being understood that the determination as to whether such material breach occurred is not in the good faith discretion of the Reporting Officer); (iii) a material breach by Executive of any of the covenants made by Executive in Section 2 hereof, provided, however, that in the event such material breach is curable, Executive shall have failed to remedy such material breach within ten (10) days of Executive having received a written demand for cure by the Reporting Officer, which demand

## 

## (d) TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR DEATH, DISABILITY OR CAUSE OR RESIGNATION BY EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON. If Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated prior to the expiration of the Term by the Company for any reason other than Executive’s death, Disability or Cause, or if Executive terminates his employment hereunder prior to the expiration of the Term for Good Reason, then:

## 

### (i) the Company shall continue to pay to Executive the Base Salary for twelve (12) months from the date of such termination (the “Severance Period”), payable in equal biweekly installments (or, if different, in accordance with the Company’s payroll practice as in effect from time to time) over the course of such twelve (12) months;

### 

### (ii) the Company shall pay Executive within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination in a lump sum in cash any Accrued Obligations (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below);

### 

### (iii) any compensation awards of Executive based on, or in the form of, Company equity (e.g. restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options or similar instruments) that are outstanding and unvested at the time of such termination but which would, but for a termination of employment, have vested during the Severance Period shall vest as of the date of such termination of employment; provided that any outstanding award with a vesting schedule that would, but for a termination of employment, have resulted in a smaller percentage (or none) of the award being vested through the end of the Severance Period than if it vested annually pro rata over its vesting period shall, for purposes of this provision, be treated as though it vested annually pro rata over its vesting period (e.g., if 100 RSUs were granted 2.7 years prior to the date of termination and vested pro rata on the first five anniversaries of the grant date and 100 RSUs were granted 1.7 years prior to the date of termination and vested on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, then on the date of termination 20 RSUs from the first award and 40 RSUs from the second award would vest); and provided further that any amounts that would vest under this provision but for the fact that outstanding performance conditions have not been satisfied shall vest only if, and at such point as, such performance conditions are satisfied; and

### 

(iv) any then vested options of Executive (including options vesting as a result of (iii) above) to purchase Company equity, shall remain exercisable through the date that is 

2

* * *

  


eighteen months following the date of such termination or, if earlier, through the scheduled expiration date of such options.

### The payment to Executive of the severance benefits described in this Section 1(d) (including any accelerated vesting), shall be subject to Executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of the Company and its affiliates, in a form substantially similar to that used for similarly situated executives of the Company and its affiliates, and Executive’s compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 2 hereof. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the severance benefits described in this Section 1(d) constitutes good and valuable consideration for such release. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without Executive’s prior written consent: (A) Executive being required to report to someone other than the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and/or the Vice Chairman as of the Effective Date, (B) the material reduction in Executive’s title, duties or level of responsibilities as of the Effective Date, excluding for this purpose any such reduction that is an isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith or that is authorized pursuant to this Agreement, but including any circumstances under which the Company is no longer publicly traded and is controlled by another company, (C) any reduction in Executive’s Base Salary, or (D) the relocation of Executive’s principal place of employment outside of the metropolitan area of Executive’s principal place of employment as of the Effective Date, provided that in no event shall Executive’s resignation be for “Good Reason” unless (x) an event or circumstance set forth in clauses (A) through (D) shall have occurred and Executive provides the Company with written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after Executive has knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, which notice specifically identifies the event or circumstance that Executive believes constitutes Good Reason, (y) the Company fails to correct the circumstance or event so identified within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice, and (z) Executive resigns within ninety (90) days after the date of delivery of the notice referred to in clause (x) above.

### 

## (e) MITIGATION; OFFSET. If Executive obtains other employment during the period of time in which the Company is required to make payments to Executive pursuant to Section 1(d)(i) above, the amount of any such remaining payments or benefits to be provided to Executive shall be reduced by the amount of compensation and benefits earned by Executive from such other employment through the end of such period (provided that for purposes of calculating which portion of the payments made under 1(d)(i) are subject to reduction, any delay in the Company making payments by virtue of Section 8A shall not be taken into account). For purposes of this Section 1(e), Executive shall have an obligation to inform the Company regarding Executive’s employment status following termination and during the period of time in which the Company is making payments to Executive under Section 1(d)(i) above.

## 

### (f) ACCRUED OBLIGATIONS. As used in this Agreement, “Accrued Obligations” shall mean the sum of (i) any portion of Executive’s accrued but unpaid Base Salary through the date of death or termination of employment for any reason, as the case may be; and (ii) any compensation previously earned but deferred by Executive (together with any interest or earnings thereon) that has not yet been paid.

(g) NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL. If the Company delivers a Non-Renewal Notice to Executive then, provided Executive’s employment hereunder continues through the expiration date then in effect, effective as of such expiration date the Company and Executive shall have the same rights and obligations hereunder as they would if the Company had terminated Executive’s employment hereunder prior to the end of the Term for any reason other than Executive’s death, Disability or Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the delivery of a Non-Renewal Notice by Executive to the Company in and of itself be deemed to be a resignation by Executive for Good Reason.

(h) EXTENDED EXERCISE PERIOD. In the event Executive’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason, all Executive’s stock options which were outstanding as of the Effective Date and which are vested as of the date of such termination shall remain exercisable until the date that is eighteen months following the date of such termination or, if earlier, the date of such options’ expiration.

Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that such information gives the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates a competitive advantage. Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at the Company’s request at any time or upon termination or expiration of Executive’s employment or as soon thereafter as possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates or prepared by Executive in the course of Executive’s employment by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 2(b), (i) Executive may become employed by a partnership, corporation or other organization that is engaged in a Competitive Activity so long as Executive has no direct or indirect responsibilities or involvement in the Competitive Activity, (ii) Executive may own, for investment purposes only, up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly-traded corporation engaged in a Competitive Activity if the stock of such corporation is either listed on a national stock exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System and if Executive is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation, (iii) if Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated by the Company for any reason other than Executive’s death, Disability or Cause, or by Executive for Good Reason, then the restrictions contained in this Section 2(b) shall lapse, and (iv) Executive shall only be subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 2(b) to the extent the activity that would otherwise be prohibited by this section poses a reasonable competitive threat to the Company, which determination shall be made by the Company in good faith.

## 

## (c) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Executive recognizes that he possesses and will possess Confidential Information about other employees, consultants and contractors of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with suppliers to and customers of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates.

Executive agrees that, during Executive’s employment with the Company, and for a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (or any individual who was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates at any time during the six (6) months prior to such act of hiring, solicitation or recruitment) for the purpose of being employed by Executive or by any business, individual, partnership, firm,

## 

## (e) PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; ASSIGNMENT. All Employee Developments are and shall be made for hire by Executive for the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. “Employee Developments” means any discovery, invention, design, method, technique, improvement, enhancement, development, computer program, machine, algorithm or other work or authorship that (i) relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or (ii) results from or is suggested by any undertaking assigned to Executive or work performed by Executive for or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether created alone or with others, during or after working hours (including before the Effective Date). All Confidential Information and all Employee Developments shall remain the sole property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Executive has not acquired and shall not acquire any proprietary interest in any Confidential Information or Employee Developments developed or acquired during the Term or during Executive’s employment with the Company before the Effective Date. To the extent Executive may, by operation of law or otherwise, acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information or Employee Development, Executive hereby assigns to the Company all such proprietary rights. Executive shall, both during and after the Term, upon the Company’s request, promptly execute and deliver to the Company all such assignments, certificates and instruments, and shall promptly perform such other acts, as the Company may from time to time in its discretion deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, perfect, enforce or defend the Company’s rights in Confidential Information and Employee Developments.

6

* * *

  


## jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 2 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state.

## 

# 3. TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS/EXISTING CLAIMS. Except for any agreements relating to currently outstanding equity awards as of the date of this Agreement (which remain outstanding, but subject to the terms of this Agreement), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and, as of the Effective Date, terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has made, and is not making, and in executing this Agreement, Executive has not relied upon, any representations, promises or inducements except to the extent the same is expressly set forth in this Agreement. Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not party to any contract, understanding, agreement or policy, whether or not written, with Executive’s most-recent employer before the Company (the “Previous Employer”) or otherwise, that would be breached by Executive’s entering into, or performing services under, this Agreement. Executive further represents that, prior to the Effective Date, (i) he has disclosed in writing to the Company all material existing, pending or threatened claims against him, if any, as a result of his employment with the Previous Employer or his membership on any boards of directors and (ii) no breach by Executive of any of his covenants in Section 2 of the Standard Terms and Conditions of the Previous Employment Agreement has occurred.

# 

# 4. ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS. This Agreement is personal in its nature and none of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the others, assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, provided that the Company may assign this Agreement to any affiliate of the Company (which affiliate clearly has sufficient assets to satisfy the Company’s obligations under this Agreement), and, in the event of the merger, consolidation, transfer, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company with or to any other individual or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of such successor and such successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and obligations of the Company hereunder, and in the event of any such assignment or transaction, all references herein to the “Company” shall refer to the Company’s assignee or successor hereunder.

# 

# 5. WITHHOLDING. The Company shall make such deductions and withhold such amounts from each payment and benefit made or provided to Executive hereunder, as may be required from time to time by applicable law, governmental regulation or order.

# 

# 6. HEADING REFERENCES. Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose. References to “this Agreement” or the use of the term “hereof” shall refer to these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Employment Agreement attached hereto, taken as a whole.

# 7. REMEDIES FOR BREACH. Executive expressly agrees and understands that Executive will notify the Company in writing of any alleged breach of this Agreement by the Company, and the Company will have thirty (30) days from receipt of Executive’s notice to cure any such breach. Executive expressly agrees and understands that in the event of any termination of Executive’s employment by the Company during the Term, the Company’s contractual obligations to Executive shall be fulfilled through compliance with its obligations under Section 1 of the Standard Terms and Conditions.

# 

# Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of Section 2 of the Standard Terms and Conditions will be inadequate and that damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon Executive’s violation of any provision of such Section 2, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction immediate injunctive relief and obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach as well as an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such violation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit the Company’s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Agreement, including Section 2, which may be pursued by or available to the Company.

# 

# 8. WAIVER; MODIFICATION. Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto.

# 

# 9. SEVERABILITY. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement.
