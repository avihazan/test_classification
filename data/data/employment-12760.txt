Employee shall devote his full time productive time, ability and attention to the business of Jore and shall perform all duties in a professional, ethical and businesslike manner. Employee will not, during the term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly engage in any other business, either as an employee, employer, consultant, principal, officer, director, advisor, or in any other capacity, either with or without compensation, that would be in conflict with Employee's duties on Jore's behalf. 

3\. Compensation. 

A. Base Compensation. Employee will be paid compensation during this Agreement at a base salary of $200,000 per year, payable in installments according to Jore's regular payroll schedules. 

B. Incentive Compensation. Employee will be paid such incentive compensation as may be agreed upon from time to time between Employee and Jore management. Unless otherwise provided herein, any bonus or other incentive compensation will be calculated on a calendar quarter basis, with the requirement Employee be employed on the last day of such quarter to qualify for the bonus.

A. Holidays, Vacation and Personal Days. Employee will be entitled to paid holidays, vacation days, and personal days each calendar year, as set out in the Jore employee handbook, or, as to corporate officers, as set forth in Jore employee compensation guidelines as adopted and modified from time to time ("Jore's Compensation Guidelines"). Jore will notify Employee on or about the beginning of each calendar year with respect to the holiday schedule for the coming year. Vacation days will be scheduled in advance subject to requirements of Jore. Such holidays must be taken during the calendar year and cannot be carried forward into the next year.

5\. Term and Termination. 

A. The Initial Term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and it shall continue in effect for a period of five (5) years. Thereafter, the Agreement shall be renewed upon the mutual agreement of Employee and Jore for successive one-year terms, unless terminated in accordance herewith. 

B. This Agreement and Employee's employment may be terminated at Jore's discretion without cause during the Initial Term with 30 days prior written notice to Employee. If the termination is without cause, Jore shall pay to Employee base compensation through the date which is one hundred twenty (120) days from the date on which the termination is to be effective as per the timely delivered notice. In addition, Employee shall be entitled to a pro rata share of incentive compensation as provided in section 3.B. through and including the effective date of termination (but not including the period of continuing compensation under this subsection). 

C. This Agreement may be terminated by Employee at Employee's discretion by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Jore. In the event of termination by Employee pursuant to this subsection, Jore may immediately relieve Employee of all duties and immediately terminate this Agreement, provided that Jore shall pay Employee at the then applicable base salary rate to the termination date included in Employee original termination notice, but in no event in excess of thirty (30) days from the date Jore receives such notice. Any incentive compensation which has accrued through such date, but has not been paid, shall be forfeited by Employee in this event, and shall not be paid. 

D. In the event that Employee is in breach of any material obligation owed Jore under this Agreement, habitually neglects the duties to be performed under this Agreement, becomes permanently disabled and is no longer able to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodation, engages in any conduct which is dishonest, damages the reputation or standing of Jore, is convicted of a serious criminal act or engages in any act listed as cause for dismissal in the Jore Employee Handbook, then Jore may terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days notice to Employee. In event of termination of the agreement pursuant to this subsection, Employee shall be paid only at the then applicable base salary rate up to and including the date of termination. Employee shall not be paid any incentive compensation or other additional compensation, prorated or otherwise. 

E. In the event Jore is acquired, or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or sells all or substantially all of its assets, this Agreement shall not be terminated and Jore agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving entity is bound by the provisions of this Agreement.
