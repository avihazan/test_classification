Business transacted at a special meeting shall be confined to the purposes stated in the call and notice thereof. 

Section 2.4 Notice of each regular and special meeting of stockholders stating the date, time and place thereof, and the general nature of the business to be considered thereat, shall be given at least ten (10) days and not more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat. Such notice shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. 

Section 2.5 Each stockholder who is entitled to vote pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, or who is entitled to vote pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Any nominee for director in an uncontested election as to whom a majority of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors are designated to be “withheld” from, or are voted “against”, that director’s election shall tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall evaluate the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders and shall recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such tendered resignation. All other questions shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on such question. 

A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of each, and the number of shares held by each, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 

The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including without limitation as officers, employees, agents of representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate inspector has been appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the Chair of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.

Section 2.6 Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders. The Chair of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders or a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat shall have the power to adjourn such meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, whether or not there is such a quorum. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law; provided, however, that if such adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after such adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting. At any such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed; but only those stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to vote at any adjournment or adjournments thereof unless the Board of Directors shall have fixed a new record date for such adjournment or adjournments pursuant to Section 2.7 of these Bylaws. 

The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. 

Section 2.7 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment or adjournments of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

Section 2.8 (A) (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at a regular meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the Corporation’s notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Bylaw. 

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before a regular meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A) (1) of this Bylaw, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than forty-five (45) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year’s regular meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the regular meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by more than sixty (60) days from the anniversary date of the preceding year’s regular meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 90th day prior to such rescheduled regular meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such rescheduled regular meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (A) (2) of this Bylaw, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s regular meeting, a stockholder’s notice required by this Bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation. 

(B) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation’s notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Bylaw. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation’s notice of meeting, if the stockholder’s notice required by paragraph (A) (2) at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by; the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. 

(C) (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a regular meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Bylaw, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded. The Chair of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bylaw and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Bylaw, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded. 

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Bylaw. Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. 

(3) For purposes of this Bylaw, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
