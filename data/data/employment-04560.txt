(b) If Employee’s employment hereunder is terminated by the Company without his consent or for any reason specified in Section 3(a) (each a “Termination Event”), then, within the 30 day period following such Termination Event, the Company shall make a lump sum payment to Employee in an amount equal to the sum of the remaining salary payments that Employee would have earned if he had continued working for the Company for the period of time equal to the balance of the term of this Employment Agreement as set forth in Section 1 remaining as of such Termination Event (the “Severance Period”).

(c) For purposes hereof, during the Severance Period Employee shall be deemed to be in service and shall continue to accrue benefits under any retirement plan of the Company and any supplemental retirement benefits agreement in effect between the Company and Employee immediately prior to the Severance Period. All such payments shall be made without reference to or deduction for any subsequent employment obtained or obtainable by Employee. In the event that Employee would be ineligible to participate in or be covered by any noncash benefit plan or program by reason of such termination of his employment, the Company shall provide substantially similar benefits or coverage through other sources.

(d) During the Severance Period the Company shall continue to make all payments of its portion of the premiums for the life insurance in effect with respect to Employee’s life. Employee shall also be entitled to receive or exercise during the Severance Period all other benefits and rights available under any benefit plans or programs to terminated or discharged employees. 

(e) Notwithstanding any amounts having been paid to Employee under Section 4, if, prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Time, Employee’s employment hereunder is terminated (i) by the Company without cause or (ii) by the Employee for good reason, (either such type of termination hereinafter referred to as an “Early Termination”), the Company, subject to the condition stated below, shall pay to Employee, in a lump sum, One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000) to compensate Employee for moving expenses and other relocating expenses related to Employee’s move from the Kansas City metropolitan area. Employee shall be eligible to receive the payment provided for under this Section 3(e) only if during the 18-month period following the Early Termination, Employee relocates his permanent residence more than 60 miles outside of the Kansas City metropolitan area. In the event Employee is eligible to receive the payment provided for under this Section 3(e), the Company shall pay Employee no later than 60 days following the date of such relocation. For purposes of this Section 3(e), Employee shall have been terminated by the Company for cause if such termination is a result of Employee’s willful misconduct that is materially injurious to the financial condition of the Company or the Employee’s failure to perform his duties, as communicated to Employee with reasonable specificity by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or IBC’s Board of Directors, after express notice of such failure to perform and a 30-day opportunity to cure such failure. For purposes of this Section 3(e),

(f) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Employment Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Employee is convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, or the Employee pleads guilty or makes a plea of nolo contendere of any felony crime, the Employee’s employment with the Company shall be terminated and all of the Employee’s rights to any and all compensation and benefits provided under and pursuant to the terms of this Employment Agreement, except to the extent protected by law, shall terminate.

6\. Confidentiality. Employee shall not at any time during or after the term of this Agreement (and without regard to the circumstances under which this Agreement or Employee’s employment hereunder may have terminated), directly or indirectly, disclose or permit those under his control to disclose, or use, or permit those under his control to use, except as shall be necessary in the performance of his duties hereunder, any trade secrets or other proprietary information owned by or confidential to IBC or any of its subsidiaries without the prior written consent of IBC including but not limited to (i) any confidential information concerning the business, affairs, properties, management or prospects (financial or otherwise) of IBC or any of its subsidiaries that he may have acquired in the course of, or as an incident to, his employment by IBC or any of its subsidiaries or predecessors or (ii) any confidential information entrusted to IBC or any of its subsidiaries or predecessors which any such company is obligated to keep confidential.

The Employee agrees (i) that the restraints contained in this Section 7, both separately and in total, are reasonable in view of the legitimate interests of the Company in protecting its trade secret information and business relationships; and (ii) to disclose to any potential future employer during the Severance Period, the terms of the restrictions against competition contained in this Section 7. 

If any provision or subpart of this Section 7 is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and subparts shall be unaffected. If any provision or subpart of this Section 7 is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable because it is overbroad or unreasonable, that provision or subpart shall not be void but rather shall be limited to the extent required to make it reasonable and shall be enforced as so limited. 

In the event of a breach of this Section 7, the Company (i) shall have no further liability for any of the severance benefits described in Section 3(b) that have not been paid as of the date of the breach, and (ii) shall be entitled, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies it may have, to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief restraining such breach.

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the Company and Employee and all such prior agreements shall be void and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time. 

10\. No Continuous Waiver. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party hereto shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by such party.

13\. Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, as applied to any party or any circumstance, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained in the Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be unenforceable as to duration, scope, activity or subject, such provision shall be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to make such provision enforceable to the extent compatible with the then existing applicable law.
