(c) If Employee remains employed by the Company or an Affiliate throughout the Restricted Period and the Performance Goal is achieved as of December 31,  , the restrictions applicable hereunder to the Restricted Shares shall terminate, and as soon as practicable thereafter a stock certificate for the Restricted Shares, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares then being held by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, shall be delivered to Employee free of such restrictions. 

(d) If Employee’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates during the Restricted Period by reason of Employee’s death, Disability (as defined in Section 2(g) hereof), Retirement (as defined in the Plan) or discharge by the Company or an Affiliate other than for Cause (as defined in Section 2(g) hereof), and the Performance Goal is achieved as of December 31,  , the restrictions applicable hereunder to the Restricted Shares shall terminate as to the number of such shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of such Restricted Shares by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of whole months of employment with the Company or an Affiliate that Employee completed after December 31,  , and prior to such termination of employment, and (ii) the denominator of which is 36, and as soon as practicable thereafter a stock certificate for such portion of the Restricted Shares (rounded to the closest whole number of shares), together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares then being held by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, shall be delivered to Employee (or in the event of Employee’s death, to Employee’s estate) free of such restrictions; provided, however, that the Committee in its discretion may reduce (including to zero) the number of the

Restricted Shares with respect to which such restrictions shall terminate pursuant to this Section 2(d). Any Restricted Shares with respect to which such restrictions do not terminate shall be forfeited by Employee and transferred to the Company at no cost to the Company. 

(e) All of the Restricted Shares shall be forfeited by Employee and transferred to the Company at no cost to the Company if (i) Employee remains employed by the Company or an Affiliate throughout the Restricted Period but the Performance Goal is not achieved as of December 31,  , or (ii) the employment of Employee by the Company or an Affiliate terminates during the Restricted Period for any reason other than Employee’s death, Disability, Retirement or discharge by the Company or an Affiliate without Cause. 

(f) If a Change in Control (as defined in Section 2(g) hereof) occurs during the Restricted Period and while Employee is employed by the Company or an Affiliate, the restrictions applicable hereunder to the Restricted Shares shall terminate and the Restricted Shares (and/or any successor securities or other property attributable to the Restricted Shares that may result from the Change in Control), together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares then being held by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, shall be delivered to Employee free of such restrictions. If a Change in Control occurs during the Restricted Period and after Employee’s employment terminates for a reason described in Section 2(d) hereof, (i) the restrictions applicable hereunder to the number of Restricted Shares calculated pursuant to the provisions of Section 2(d) hereof shall terminate and said number of such shares (and/or any successor securities or other property attributable to such shares that may result from the Change in Control), together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares then being held by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, shall be delivered to Employee (or in the event of Employee’s death, to Employee’s estate) free of such restrictions, and (ii) any Restricted Shares with respect to which such restrictions do not terminate shall be forfeited by Employee and transferred to the Company at no cost to the Company.

(1) individuals who, as of  , constitute the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to  , whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be, for purposes of this Plan, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; 

(2) the stockholders of the Company shall approve a reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own outstanding voting securities representing at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (“Voting Securities”) of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company; 

(3) the stockholders of the Company shall approve a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or a sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the Company; or 

(4) any “person,” as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (other than the Company, any of its subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of such a plan), together with all “affiliates” and “associates” (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of such person (as well as any “Person” or “group” as those terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), shall become the “beneficial owner” or “beneficial owners” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing in the aggregate twenty-five percent (25%) or more of either (A) the then outstanding shares of common stock, par value $3.33-1/3 per share, of the Company (“Common Stock”) or (B) the Voting Securities of the Company, in either such case other than solely as a result of acquisitions of such securities directly from the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, a person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, or to dispose, or to direct the disposition of, Common Stock or other Voting Securities of the Company shall be deemed the beneficial owner of such Common Stock or Voting Securities. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a “Change in Control” of the Company shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of subparagraph (4) of this Section 2(g)(iv) solely as the result of an acquisition of securities by the Company which, by reducing the

number of shares of Common Stock or other Voting Securities of the Company outstanding, increases (i) the proportionate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any person to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) the proportionate voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company beneficially owned by any person to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that if any person referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Common Stock or other Voting Securities of the Company (other than a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction), then a Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes subparagraph (4) of this Section 2(g)(iv). 

3\. Rights as Shareholder. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, upon the issuance of a certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Shares to Employee, Employee shall become the owner thereof for all purposes and shall have all rights as a stockholder, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends and distributions, with respect to the Restricted Shares. If the Company shall pay or declare a dividend or make a distribution of any kind, whether due to a reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise, with respect to the shares of Company common stock constituting the Restricted Shares, then the Company shall pay or make such dividend or other distribution with respect to the Restricted Shares; provided, however, that the cash, stock or other securities and other property constituting such dividend or other distribution shall be held by the Company subject to the restrictions applicable hereunder to the Restricted Shares until the Restricted Shares are either forfeited by Employee and transferred to the Company or the restrictions thereon terminate as set forth in this Agreement. If the Restricted Shares with respect to which such dividend or distribution was paid or made are forfeited by Employee pursuant to the provisions hereof, then Employee shall not be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and such dividend or distribution shall likewise be forfeited and transferred to the Company. If the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such dividend or distribution was paid or made terminate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, then Employee shall be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution with respect to such shares, without interest, and such dividend or distribution shall likewise be delivered to Employee. 

4\. Withholding Taxes. 

(a) Employee may elect, within 30 days of the Effective Date and on notice to the Company, to realize income for federal income tax purposes equal to the fair market value of the Restricted Shares on the Effective Date. In such event, Employee shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate to pay in the year of the Award any federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld with respect to such shares. If Employee fails to make such payments, then any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise due from the Company or an Affiliate to or with respect to Employee, whether or not pursuant to this Agreement, or the Plan and regardless of the form of payment, any 

5 

* * *

##### 

federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares. 

(b) If no election is made by Employee pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof, then upon the termination of the restrictions applicable hereunder to all or any portion of the Restricted Shares, Employee (or in the event of Employee’s death, the administrator or executor of Employee’s estate) will pay to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or such Affiliate regarding payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such restrictions have terminated. If Employee (or in the event of Employee’s death, the administrator or executor of Employee’s estate) fails to make such payments, then any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise due from the Company or an Affiliate to or with respect to Employee, whether or not pursuant to this Agreement, or the Plan and regardless of the form of payment, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such restrictions have terminated. 

5\. Reclassification of Shares. In case of any consolidation or merger of another corporation into the Company in which the Company is the surviving corporation and in which there is a reclassification or change (including the right to receive cash or other property) of the Restricted Shares (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, but including any change in such shares into two or more classes or series of shares), the Committee may provide that payment of the Restricted Shares shall take the form of the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities (including those of any new direct or indirect parent of the Company), property, cash or any combination thereof receivable upon such consolidation or merger. 

6\. Effect on Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Employee the right to continue in the employment of the Company or an Affiliate, or affect any right which the Company or an Affiliate may have to terminate the employment of Employee. 

7\. Legend. Each certificate representing the Restricted Shares shall conspicuously set forth on the face or back thereof, in addition to any legends required by applicable law or other agreement, a legend in substantially the following form:
