This Option is granted on ________________ ____, 200X (the “Grant Date”),­ by First Bancshares, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“Corporation”), to __________ (the “Optionee”), in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

  


1.

Option Grant and Exercise Period. The Corporation here­by grants to the Optionee an Incentive Stock Option (“Option”) to purchase, pursuant to the First Bancshares, Inc. 2004 Stock Option Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the “Plan”), and upon the terms and conditions therein and hereinafter set forth, an aggregate of _______ shares (the “Option Shares”) of the common stock of the Corporation (“Share” or “Shares”) at the price of $______ per Share (the “Exercise Price”). A copy of the Plan, as currently in effect, is incorporated herein by reference and is attached to this Award Agreement.

  


Except as provided in Sections 8 and 9 below, this Option shall be exercisable only during the period (the “Exercise Period”) commencing on the dates set forth in Section 2 below, and ending at 5:00 p.m., Mountain Grove, Missouri time, on the date ten years after the Grant Date, such later time and date being hereinafter referred to as the “Expiration Date,” subject to earlier expiration in accordance with Section 5 in the event of a Termination of Service.

The notice of exercise of this Option shall be in the form prescribed by the Committee referred to in Section 3 of the Plan and directed to the address set forth in Section 12 below. The date of exercise is the date on which such notice is received by the Corporation. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Exercise Price for the Option Shares to be purchased upon such exercise. Payment shall be made (i) in cash, which may be in the form of a check, money order, cashier’s check or certified check, payable to the Corporation, or (ii) by delivering Shares already owned by the Optionee having a Market Value equal to the Exercise Price, or (iii) a combination of cash and such Shares. Promptly after such payment, subject to Section 3 below, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the Optionee or other person exercising this Option a certificate or certificates repre senting the Option Shares so purchased, registered in the name of the Optionee (or such other person), or, upon request, in the name of the Optionee (or such other person) and in the name of another in such form of joint ownership as requested by the Optionee (or such other person) pursuant to applicable state law.

  


3.

Delivery and Registration of the Option Shares. The Corporation’s obligation to deliver the Option Shares hereunder shall, if the Committee so requests, be conditioned upon the Optionee’s compliance with the terms and provisions of Section 11 of the Plan.

  


4.

Nontransferability of This Option. This Option may not be assigned, encumbered, transferred, pledged or hypothecated except, in the event of the death of the Optionee, by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution to the extent provided in Section 5 below. This Option is exercisable during the Optionee’s lifetime only by the Optionee or a person acting with the legal authority of the Optionee. The provisions of this Option shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto, the successors and assigns of the Corporation and any person acting with the legal authority of the Optionee to whom this Option is transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

  


5.

Termination of Service or Death or Disability of the Optionee. Except as provided in this Section 5 and in Section 9 below, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Option to the contrary, this Option shall be exercisable only if the Optionee has not incurred a Termination of Service at the time of such exercise.

  


If the Optionee incurs a Termination of Service for any reason excluding death, Disability and Termination of Service for Cause, then the Optionee may, but only within the period of three months immediately succeeding such Termination of Service and in no event after the Expiration Date, exercise this Option to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise this Option on the date of Termination of Service. If the Optionee incurs a Termination of Service for Cause, all rights under this Option shall expire immediately upon the giving to the Optionee of notice of such termination, except as provided in Section 9 below.

In the event of the death or Disability of the Optionee prior to the Optionee’s Termination of Service or within three months thereafter, the Optionee or person or persons to whom the Option has been transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution may, but only to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise this Option on the date of the Optionee’s death or Disability, exercise this Option at any time within one year following the death or Disability of the Optionee, but in no event after the Expiration Date.

  


Following the death of the Optionee, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, as an alternative means of settlement of this Option, elect to pay to the person to whom this Option is transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, the amount by which the Market Value per Share on the date of exercise of this Option shall exceed the Exercise Price for each of the Option Shares, multiplied by the number of the Option Shares with respect to which this Option is properly exercised. Any such settlement of this Option shall be considered an exercise of this Option for all purposes of this Option and of the Plan.

  


6.

Notice of Sale. The Optionee or any person to whom the Option Shares shall have been transferred shall promptly give notice to the Corporation in the event of the sale or other disposition of the Option Shares within the later of (i) two years from the Grant Date or (ii) one year from the date of exercise of this Option. Such notice shall specify the number of the Option Shares sold or otherwise disposed of and be directed to the address set forth in Section 12 below.

  


7.

Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization of the Corporation. In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares by reason of any recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, merger, or any other change in the corporate structure of the Corporation or in the Shares, the number and class of the Option Shares covered by this Option and the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determi­nation shall be conclusive. However, any repurchases by the Corporation of its Shares shall have no affect on the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, or Awards granted under the Plan.

  


8.

Effect of Merger or Other Reorganization. In the event of any merger, consolidation or combination of the Corporation with or into another corporation (other than a merger, consolidation or combination in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and which does not result in the outstanding Shares being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or other property, or any combination thereof), the Optionee shall have the right (subject to the provisions of the Plan and the limitations contained herein), thereafter and during the Exercise Period, to receive upon exercise of this Option an amount equal to the excess of the Market Value on the date of such exercise of the securities, cash or other property, or combination thereof, receivable upon such merger, consolidation or combination in respect of a Share over the Exercise Price, multiplied by the number of the Option Shares with respect to which this Option shall have been exercised. Such amount may be payable fully in cash, fully in one or more of 

  
  


  


ISO-

  


  
  


the kind or kinds of property payable in such merger, consolidation or combination, or partly in cash and partly in one or more of such kind or kinds of property, all in the discretion of the Committee. The exercise of the right provided herein shall result in that portion of this Option so exercised being disqualified as an incentive stock option for tax purposes and being deemed a non-qualified stock option for tax purposes.

  


9.

Effect of Change in Control. If a tender offer or exchange offer for Shares (other than such an offer by the Corporation) is commenced, or if a change in control as defined in the Plan shall occur, all Options theretofore granted and not fully exercisable shall become exercisable in full upon the happening of such event. 

  


10.

Shareholder Rights Not Granted by This Option. The Optionee is not entitled by virtue hereof to any rights of a shareholder of the Corporation or to notice of meetings of shareholders or to notice of any other proceedings of the Corporation.

  


11.

Withholding Tax. Where the Optionee or another person is entitled to receive the Option Shares pursuant to the exercise of this Option, the Corporation shall have the right to require the Optionee or such other person to pay to the Corporation the amount of any taxes which the Corporation or any of its Affiliates is required to withhold with respect to the Option Shares, or in lieu thereof, to retain, or sell without notice, a sufficient number of the Option Shares to cover the amount required to be withheld, or, in lieu of any of the foregoing, to withhold a sufficient sum from the Optionee’s compensation payable by the Corporation to satisfy the Corporation’s tax withholding requirements.

  


12.

Notices. All notices hereunder to the Corporation shall be delivered or mailed to it addressed to the Corporate Secretary of First Bancshares, Inc., 142 East First Street, Mountain Grove, Missouri 65711. Any notices hereunder to the Optionee shall be delivered personally or mailed to the Optionee’s address noted below. Such addresses for the service of notices may be changed at any time provided written notice of the change is furnished in advance to the Corporation or to the Optionee, as the case may be.

  


13.

14.
