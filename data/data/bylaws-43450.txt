If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday in the State of Delaware, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day.

Section 2.5. Meetings, How Convened. Every meeting, for whatever purpose, of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be convened by the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary or other officer, or any of the persons calling the meeting by notice given as herein provided. 

Section 2.6. Closing Transfer Books; Record Date. The Board of Directors shall have power to close the transfer books of the Corporation for a period not exceeding fifty days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date of payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect; provided, however, that in lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, not exceeding fifty days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of the dividend, or to receive the allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of the change, conversion or exchange of shares. In such case, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record on the date of closing the transfer books, or on the record date so fixed, shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of the dividend, or to receive the allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the date of closing of the transfer books or the record date fixed as aforesaid. If the Board of Directors does not close the transfer books or set a record date, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the close of business on the twentieth day preceding the date of the meeting shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting, and any adjournment of the meeting; except that, if prior to the meeting written waivers of notice of the meeting are signed and delivered to the Corporation by all of the shareholders of record at the time the meeting is convened, only the shareholders who are shareholders of record at the time the meeting is convened shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, and any adjournment of the meeting.

Such list shall also be produced and subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting. The original share ledger or transfer books, or a duplicate thereof, shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or share ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders.

Section 2.8. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders. If less than a quorum is present, those present may adjourn the meeting until a specified date, not longer than ninety days after such adjournment, and no notice need be given of such adjournment to shareholders not present at the meeting. Every decision of a majority of such quorum shall be valid as a corporate act unless a different vote is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

Section 2.9. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by the shareholderâ€™s duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable only if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power of attorney. The interest with which it is coupled need not be an interest in the shares themselves. If any instrument of proxy designates two or more persons to act as proxy, in the absence of any provisions in the proxy to the contrary, the persons designated may represent and vote the shares in accordance with the vote or consent of the majority of the persons named as proxies. If only one such proxy is present, the proxy may vote all of the shares, and all the shares standing in the name of the principal or principals for whom such proxy acts shall be deemed represented for the purpose of obtaining a quorum. The foregoing provisions shall apply to the voting of shares by proxies for any two or more personal representatives, trustees or other fiduciaries, unless an instrument or order of court appointing them otherwise directs. 

Section 2.10. Voting of Shares. Each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders. 

Section 2.11. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may determine. 

Shares standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by his or her personal representative, either in person or by proxy. Shares standing in the name of a conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no conservator or trustee shall be entitled, as a fiduciary to vote shares held by him or her without a transfer of such shares into his or her name. 

\- 3 - 

* * *

  


Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so to do be contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed. 

A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. 

Neither shares of its own stock held by the Corporation, nor those held by another corporation if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are owned beneficially and of record (and not in trust) by this Corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time. 

Section 2.12. Shareholder Action Without a Meeting. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. Such consents shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the shareholders at a meeting duly held. The Secretary of the Corporation shall file such consents with the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders. 

Section 2.13. Shareholdersâ€™ Right to Examine Books and Records. This Corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account, including the amount of its assets and liabilities, minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders and Board of Directors, and the names and places of residence of its officers; and it shall keep at its registered office or principal place of business in this state, or at the office of its transfer agent in this state, if any, books and records in which shall be recorded the number of shares subscribed, the names of the owners of the shares, the numbers owned by them respectively, the amount of shares paid, and by whom, and the transfer of such shares with the date of transfer. Each shareholder may, during normal business hours, have access to the books of the Corporation, to examine the same. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, further prescribe regulations with respect to any such examination. 

ARTICLE III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 3.1. General Powers. The property and business of the Corporation shall be controlled and managed by its Board of Directors. 

Section 3.2. Number, Term and Qualifications. The initial number of directors of the Corporation shall be three (3).

A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.

Section 3.4. Special Meetings. A special meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by, or at the request of, the Chief Executive Officer, President, or any director.

Section 3.5. Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be delivered at least two days prior thereto by written notice delivered personally or left at or mailed to each director at his or her business or residence address, or by telegram or telefax. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If notice be given by telegram or telefax, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when the text of the telegram or telefax is delivered to the telegraph or telefax company. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. 

Section 3.6. Quorum; Participation by Telephone. A majority of the full Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if less than a majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, whether regular or special, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting in this manner shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 

Section 3.7. Manner of Acting. The act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a different number is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. 

Section 3.8. Action Without a Meeting. Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee of directors may be taken without a meeting if consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by all of the members of the Board of Directors or of the committee, as the case may be. Such written consents shall be filed by the Secretary with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors or of the committee, as the case may be, and shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote at a meeting duly held.

Written notice may be delivered by certified or registered mail, with postage thereon prepaid and a return receipt requested. Such resignation shall take effect on the date of the receipt of such notice which date of receipt shall be deemed to be the date indicated upon the registered or certified mail return receipt, or at any later time specified therein. Unless otherwise specified, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. 

Section 3.10. Removal by Shareholders. Any director or directors may be removed, with or without cause, at a meeting of the shareholders called expressly for that purpose. The entire Board of Directors may be removed by a vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Any director may be removed for cause by action of a majority of the entire Board of Directors if the director to be removed shall, at the time of removal, fail to meet the Corporationâ€™s qualifications for election as a director as set forth in its Certificate of Incorporation or in these Bylaws, or if the director shall be in breach of any agreement between such director and the Corporation relating to such directorâ€™s services as a director or employee of the Corporation. Notice of the proposed removal shall be given to all directors of the Corporation prior to action thereon. 

Section 3.12. Vacancies. In case of the death, incapacity or resignation of one or more of the directors, or in the case of a newly created directorship resulting from any increase in the number of directors to constitute the Board of Directors, a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or the sole remaining director, may fill the vacancy or vacancies until the next election of directors by the shareholders. 

Section 3.13. Compensation. By resolution of the Board of Directors, each director may be paid his or her expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, and may be paid a stated salary as director or a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or both. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 

Section 3.14. Presumption of Assent. A director of the Corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the director dissents or abstains at such meeting, and the fact of such dissent or abstention (a) is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or (b) shall be filed by the director in writing with the person acting as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or (c) shall have been recorded by the director and forwarded by registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation promptly after the adjournment of the meeting.
