6.1.1 the borrower commits an act similar to an act of insolvency as defined in the Insolvency Act of 1936 (as amended) or an act defined in terms of section 344 of the Companies Act of 1973 (as amended); or

6.1.10any material indebtedness or obligation for any loans, constituting indebtedness of the borrower becomes due and payable prior to its specified maturity by reason of default or is not paid when due. 

6.2. Should such event be incapable of remedy or should the borrower fail to remedy or procure the remedy of the same within the time period thus provided, in the case of non-payment of any amount within 7 days, or in the case of any other remediable breach within 21 days (or such longer period as may be agreed between the parties), in each case after receipt of written notice from the bank calling for rectification thereof, then the bank shall be entitled, without derogating from any other right which the bank may hereby or otherwise require, to:

7.2.3 this agreement constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the borrower;

7.2.8 there has been no material adverse change in the financial or other condition of the borrower since the date of its last audited financial statements.

8.2 All payments to be made by the borrower hereunder shall be made free and without deduction of any taxes, charges or costs. If the borrower shall at any time be compelled by law to withhold or deduct taxes from any amounts payable to the bank, the amounts so payable to the bank shall be increased to such extent that the net amounts after such withholdings or deductions shall equal the amount of interest, capital or any other amount provided for in this agreement. 

8.3 No variation of this agreement shall be of any force and effect unless reduced to writing and signed by the parties or their authorised agents. This agreement supersedes and replaces all previous agreements between the parties with respect to the loan facility. 

8.4 No relaxation or indulgence which either party may show to the other shall in any way prejudice or be deemed to be a waiver of its rights in terms hereof or be a novation of this agreement. 

8.5 Save where the borrower has opened an associated transaction account, this agreement is the whole agreement between the parties and no variation shall be of any force or effect unless agreed to by the bank in writing. Where the borrower has opened an associated transaction account the finance charge rate to be applied during any month in respect of which the terms and conditions applicable to such associated transaction account have application, will be the rate derived from the undermentioned formula, namely: 

Cx(1-Yx(A/B))

Where:-

A = transaction account average daily balance for the previous month.

B = the present value of the outstanding instalments at the time of calculating this finance charge rate.

C = variable finance charge rate otherwise applicable under this agreement in respect of the month in question.

Y = variable bank margin factor, which may be adjusted from time to time by agreement between the parties.

Any such transaction account shall only come into effect upon compliance with clause 3 above.

8.6 Without prejudice to the bank's right to institute proceedings in a high court having jurisdiction, the parties agree and the borrower hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court having jurisdiction over its person notwithstanding that the cause of action or amount of any claim hereunder might exceed the jurisdiction of any magistrate's court.

8.8 All reasonable costs of and incidental to the drawing and preparation of this agreement and the stamp duty of this agreement and on all other documents and all 

costs which the bank may incur in connection with the enforcement or the preservation of any of its rights under this agreement, shall be borne and paid by the borrower. 

8.9 For the purpose of any litigation, or otherwise, a certificate written and signed by any manager of the bank (whose status need not be proven) setting out the amount of the borrower's indebtedness to the bank in terms hereof, shall be prima facie proof of the correctness of the amount owing including, but not limited to, damages, costs and interest due and owing. 

8.10 All the provisions of this agreement shall be severable and no provision shall be affected by the invalidity of any other provision of this agreement. 

9.IMPOSSIBILITY 

Where, as a result of vis major, casus fortuitus, an act of God, an act of the State or any statutory authority, any statutory provision or the application thereof, war or civil unrest or any other act or happening beyond the control of the bank, the bank finds itself in its sole judgement unable to give effect to any part of this agreement, the bank may at its election and without becoming liable for consequential or any other damages: 

9.1 cancel this agreement by giving written notice to the borrower to that effect, and demand repayment of the principal debt plus finance charges, recalculated to the date of repayment, within 30 days from the date of notice of cancellation; or
