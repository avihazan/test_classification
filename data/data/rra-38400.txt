2\. Registration Rights. 

(a) Demand Registration. 

(i) At any time on or after the first anniversary of the execution of this Agreement, any Stockholder shall have the right to require the Company to effect the registration of his Registrable Shares on Form S-1 (or any successor form under the Securities Act) (any such registration, a “Demand Registration”). Upon receipt of any request for a Demand Registration, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such request to each Stockholder entitled to request a Demand Registration, and shall include in such Demand Registration all shares of Company Stock with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 30 days after the delivery of the Company’s notice. If securities held by Persons other than those Stockholders exercising rights pursuant to the first or second sentence of this subsection 2(a) (“Other Securities”) are included in any Demand Registration that is an underwritten offering, and the managing underwriter for such offering advises the Company that in its opinion the amount of securities to be included exceeds the amount of securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability thereof, the Company will include in such registration Registrable Shares requested to be included therein prior to the inclusion of any Other Securities. If the number of shares of Company Stock requested to be included in such registration pursuant to the first or second sentence of this subsection 2(a), including the Registrable Shares, exceeds the amount of securities that in the opinion of such managing underwriter can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering, the Registrable Shares to be included in such registration shall be reduced pro rata among the Stockholders, based on the percentage of then-outstanding shares of Company Stock held by each such Stockholder that has requested the Registrable Shares to be registered. A registration requested pursuant to this subsection 2(a) shall not be deemed to have been effected (i) unless a registration statement with respect thereto has become effective, (ii) if after a registration statement has become effective, such registration statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason, (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in this Agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or (iv) if it is withdrawn at the request of the Stockholders. 

(ii) At any time after the Company becomes eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form relating to secondary offerings), any Stockholder, may request the Company, in writing, to effect the registration on Form S-3 (or such successor form), of Registrable Shares having an aggregate offering price of at least $250,000 (based on the current public market price). Upon receipt of any such request, the Company shall promptly give written notice of such proposed registration to all other Stockholders. Such Stockholders shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Company within thirty (30) days after the Company provides its notice, to elect to have included in such registration such of their shares of Company Stock as such Stockholders may request in such notice of election. Thereupon, the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to effect the registration on Form S-3, or such successor form, of all shares of Company Stock that the Company has been requested to register, including the Registrable Shares. The 

2 

* * *

##### 

Company shall not be required to effect more than one registration pursuant to subsection 2(a)(i) but may be required to effect an unlimited number of registrations pursuant to this subsection 2(a)(ii). In addition, the Company shall not be required to effect any registration (other than on Form S-3 or any successor form relating to secondary offerings) within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any other registration statement of the Company. 

(b) Incidental Registration. Whenever the Company proposes to file a registration statement (other than on Form S-8 or any successor form or pursuant to subsection 2(a)(i)) at any time and from time to time, it will, prior to such filing, give written notice to the Stockholder(s), of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any Stockholder, within twenty (20) days after the Company provides such notice (which request shall state the intended method of disposition of such Shares), the Company shall use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Shares that the Company has been requested by such Stockholder(s) to register to be registered under the Securities Act to the extent necessary to permit their sale or other disposition in accordance with the intended methods of distribution specified in the request of such Stockholder(s); provided, however, that if the offering is underwritten and the managing underwriter(s) advise the Company that, in their opinion, the inclusion of the amount of Registrable Shares requested to be included therein exceeds the amount of securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability, thereof, then the Company shall include therein, to the extent permitted by the managing underwriter, Registrable Shares of such Stockholder(s), determined pro rata on the basis of the percentage of the then-outstanding shares of Company Stock then held by such Stockholder(s). 

(c) Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, the Company shall not be required to include in any registration pursuant to subsections 2(a) or (b), any Registrable Shares that are then eligible for transfer pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or may otherwise be freely transferred without registration under the Securities Act. In connection with any underwritten public offering of the Registrable Shares, the Stockholders agree that they shall execute a customary “holdback” agreement in the form requested by the underwriter(s) for such offering whereby such Stockholders agree, for a period of up to 180 days following the consummation of such offering, not to sell, offer to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares other than pursuant to such offering. 

3\. The Company’s Holdback Agreements. The Company agrees: (i) not to affect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the seven days prior to and the 120 day period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten registration filed under the Securities Act (except as part of any such registration or pursuant to registrations on Form S-8 or any successor form); and (ii) to use all reasonable efforts to cause each holder of at least 5% (on a fully diluted basis) of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for its equity securities, to agree not to affect any public sale or distribution of any of their securities during that period (except as part of the underwritten registration, if otherwise permitted), unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree in writing.

(d) make every reasonable effort to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the registration in the event that the registration statement ceases to be effective for any reason at any time (other than because of the sale of all of the securities registered by the registration statement); 

(e) use its best efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Shares under the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions that any selling Stockholder or any underwriter reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the selling Stockholders or any underwriter to consummate the disposition in these jurisdictions of the Registrable Shares; provided that the Company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not

(m) at the request of the selling Stockholders in connection with an underwritten offering, furnish on the date or dates provided for in the underwriting agreement: (i) an opinion of outside counsel, dated as of the effective date of such registration statement, addressed to the underwriters and the selling Stockholders, covering any matters that the underwriters and holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares being sold may reasonably request, including any matters that are customarily furnished in connection with an underwritten offering; and (ii) a comfort letter or letters, dated as of the effective date of such registration statement, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company addressed to the underwriters and the selling Stockholders, covering any matters that the underwriters and holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares being sold reasonably request, in which letter(s) the accountants will state, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that they are independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and that in their opinion the financial statements and other financial data of the Company included in the registration statement, the prospectus(es), or any amendment or supplement, comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act;

* * *

##### 

seller and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. 

5\. Allocation of Expenses. The Company will pay all Registration Expenses of all registrations under this Agreement; provided, however, that if a registration is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Stockholder(s) (other than as a result of material adverse information concerning the business or financial condition of the Company that is made known to the Stockholders after the date on which such registration was requested) and if the Stockholder(s) elect not to have such registration counted as a registration requested under subsection 2(a), each Stockholder shall pay the Registration Expenses of such registration pro rata in accordance with the number of his Registrable Shares included in such registration. For purposes of this Section, the term “Registration Expenses” shall mean all expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Section 2, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, exchange listing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares included in the registration to represent the Stockholders, state Blue Sky fees and expenses, and the expense of any special audits incident to or required by any such registration, but excluding underwriting discounts, selling commissions and the fees and expenses of each Stockholder’s counsel. 

6\. Indemnification. 

(a) By the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder holding Registrable Shares covered by a registration statement, its officers, directors, employees, partners and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Shares (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments) or any preliminary prospectus, statutory prospectus, free writing prospectus or summary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or caused by any violation by the Company of the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any other federal or state securities or blue sky laws applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with such registration or qualification under such federal, state securities or blue sky laws, and shall reimburse each Stockholder holding Registrable Shares covered by a registration statement, its officers, directors, employees, partners and agents and each Person, if any, who controls such Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission so made based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by such Stockholder. The Company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the Registrable Shares, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters 

7 

* * *

##### 

on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Stockholders provided in this subsection 6(a). 

(b) By the Stockholders. Each Stockholder holding Registrable Shares included in any registration statement agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Stockholder, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by such Stockholder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus, statutory prospectus, free writing prospectus or summary prospectus. Each such Stockholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the Registrable Shares, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Company provided in this Section 6. As a condition to including Registrable Shares in any registration statement filed in accordance with this Agreement, the Company may require that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to indemnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with respect to similar securities. No Stockholder shall be liable under this subsection 6(b) for any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in excess of the net proceeds actually realized by such Stockholder in the sale of Registrable Shares of such Stockholder to which such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense relates. 

(c) Procedure. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying Person of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not limit the rights of such Person except to the extent such failure to provide notice materially prejudices the indemnifying Person) and (ii) unless in such indemnified Person’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Person; provided, however, that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (x) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (y) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). If such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (i) such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the indemnified party or (ii) the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing. An indemnifying Person who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying Person with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified Person a conflict of interest may exist 

8 

* * *

##### 

between such indemnified Person and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. 

(d) Contribution. Each party agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by this Section 6 are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions that resulted in the losses, liabilities, claims, damages, or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this subsection 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or, except as provided in subsection 6(c), defending any such action or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. If indemnification is available under this Section 6, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in this Section 6 without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this subsection 6(d). 

(e) Nonexclusivity. The indemnification and contribution by any Person provided for under this Agreement shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have at law or in equity or pursuant to contract. 

(f) Survival. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person or any officer, director, employee, agent or controlling Person of such indemnified Person and will survive the transfer of securities. The Company also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified Person for contribution to such Person in the event the Company’s indemnification is unavailable for any reason. 

7\. Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Person may participate in any registration hereunder that is underwritten unless such Person (i) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by such Person or Persons 

9 

* * *

##### 

entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided, however, that no Stockholder will be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with any registration other than as to (x) that Stockholder’s ownership of its Registrable Shares to be sold or transferred free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, (y) that Stockholder’s power and authority to effect such transfer, and (z) such matters pertaining to the compliance with securities laws as may be reasonably requested. 

8\. Current Public Information. The Company will file, based upon information furnished by Stockholders, all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will take such further action as any Stockholder may reasonably request to enable that Stockholder to sell Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act (as such rules may be amended from time to time) or any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon reasonable request, the Company shall deliver to any holder of Registrable Shares a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 

9\. Miscellaneous. 

(a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Stockholders in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares. 

(b) Adjustments Affecting Registrable Shares. The Company will not take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to its securities that would adversely affect the ability of any Stockholder to include Registrable Shares in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement or that would adversely affect the marketability of Registrable Shares in any registration. 

(c) Remedies. Any Person having rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to enforce those rights specifically, to recover damages caused by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law, in equity, or otherwise. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and that, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, any party shall be entitled to specific performance and/or other injunctive relief from any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction (without posting any bond or other security) in order to enforce or prevent violation of the provisions of this Agreement. 

(d) Notices. All notices and other communications under or in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) if delivered personally, upon delivery, (b) if delivered by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), upon the earlier of actual delivery or three days after being mailed, or (c) if given by telecopy, upon confirmation of transmission by telecopy, in each case to the parties at the following addresses:
