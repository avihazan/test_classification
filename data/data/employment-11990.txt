iv. Discretionary Termination by Executive. Executive may terminate the Employment at will, with at least thirty (30) days advance written notice. If Executive gives such notice of termination, the Company may (but need not) relieve Executive of some or all of Executive's responsibilities for part or all of such notice period, provided that Executive's pay and benefits are continued for the lesser of thirty (30) days or the remaining period of the Employment.

(b) Termination With Severance Pay. Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation from the Company or any Affiliate after termination of the Employment as permitted by this Section 5(b), except (A) unpaid salary installments through the end of the week in which the Employment terminates, (B) any vested benefits accrued before the termination of Employment under the terms of any written Company policy or benefit program, (C) any Severance Pay to which Executive is entitled under this subsection 5(b).

fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be paid by the Company and one-half by the Executive. The attorney fees and expenses incurred by the parties shall be paid by each party; provided, however, that the attorney fees and expenses of the party who substantially prevails in any arbitration brought pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by the other party or, if each party prevails in part, then a proportionate part of each party's attorney fees and expenses shall be paid by the other party, with such proportion to represent the approximate portion of such attorney fees and expenses relating to the issues on which each party prevailed.
