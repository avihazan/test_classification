Salary. The Company shall pay the Employee, in equal semi-monthly installments or otherwise in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll policies as such policies may exist from time to time, an annual base salary of $450,000, effective July 1, 2013. Such salary shall be subject to review, as determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee and approved by the Board, on an annual basis, but the Board shall not decrease the Employee’s annual base salary at any such annual review.

As additional compensation for services rendered, the Company has granted to the Employee the right and option to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock and in the future may grant additional options to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the Employee in accordance with the terms of the Company’s stock plan then in effect. Notwithstanding any option certificate or agreement to the contrary, the following provisions apply to all options granted to the Employee either prior to or after the Commencement Date:  
  
(a) 

All such options that are not vested as of the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 6) shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable as of the Date of Termination, except in the case of termination: (i) for Cause (as defined in Section 6) or (ii) at the election of the Employee for any reason other than for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4.4 or 4.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing if upon a Change in Control as defined in Section 6.5 (c) or (d), any of the options are terminated in connection with the Change in Control, then all such options that are not vested as of the date of the Change in Control shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable immediately prior to the Change in Control; and

* * *

(b) 

All of such options that are vested as of the Date of Termination shall expire on the first to occur of: (i) 24 months following the Employee’s retirement; (ii) 24 months following the Employee’s Date of Termination other than (A) for Cause (as defined in Section 6), or (B) termination at the election of the Employee pursuant to Section 4.6; (iii) the expiration date of the option as set forth in the applicable option certificate or agreement; or (iv) as otherwise provided in the applicable option plan in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation. For purposes of this subsection, “retirement” requires that the Employee not render services of any nature for any entity as a regular employee, and not render services of any nature for any entity for more than an average of twenty (20) hours per week as a consultant or term employee.  
  
Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall apply to or affect any equity award that is not either an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or a non-qualified stock option.

3.4

Restricted Share Units. As additional compensation for services rendered, the Company has granted to the Employee restricted share units for the issuance of the Company’s Common Stock and in the future may grant additional restricted share units for the issuance of the Company’s Common Stock to the Employee in accordance with the terms of the Company’s stock plan then in effect. Notwithstanding any restricted share unit certificate or agreement to the contrary, all restricted share units granted to the Employee either prior to or after the Commencement Date that are not vested as of the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 6) shall immediately vest as of the Date of Termination, except in the case of termination: (a) for Cause (as defined in Section 6) or (b) at the election of the Employee for any reason other than for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4.4 or 4.5. To the extent that vesting of any such restricted shares units otherwise would have been contingent upon the achievement of performance objectives, vesting of such restricted share units pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be (i) at the “target” level, regardless of achievement of performance objectives, in the case of termination pursuant to Section 4.3 or 4.5; or (ii) based upon actual achievement of performance objectives as determined after the end of the applicable performance period, in the case of termination under any other circumstances entitling the Employee to accelerated vesting pursuant to this Section 3.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if upon a Change in Control as defined in Section 6.5 (c) or (d), any of the restricted share units are terminated in connection with the Change in Control, then all such restricted share units that are not vested as of the date of the Change in Control shall vest as of the date of the Change in Control.

5.5 

Termination by Reason of the Employee’s Death or Disability. If, prior to the expiration of the Employment Period, the Employee’s employment is terminated by the Employee’s death or Disability pursuant to Section 4.3, the Company shall pay to the Employee, or in the case of the Employee’s death, to the estate of the Employee, twenty-four (24) months of his salary in effect on the Date of Termination in one-lump sum amount within sixty (60) days after the Date of Termination, plus medical and dental benefits (as described in Section 5.1(c)).  
  
5.6 

Withholding and Deductions, 409A.  
  
(a) 

All payments hereunder shall be subject to withholding and to such other deductions as shall at the time of such payment be required pursuant to any income tax or other law, whether of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, in the case of payments to the executors or administrators to the Employee's estate, the delivery to the Company of all necessary tax waivers and other documents.  
  
(b) 

In the event the Employee is required pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code to pay (through withholding or otherwise) an excise tax on “excess parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) made by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Employee within thirty (30) days of the Change in Control, such additional amounts as are necessary to place the Employee in the same after tax financial position that he would have been in if he had not incurred any tax liability under Section 4999 of the Code.  
  
8

* * *

(c) 

In the event the Employee is required to pay any federal, state or local income taxes as a result of the Company’s payment of the Employee’s COBRA premiums under this Section 5, the Company shall pay the Employee not later than the end of the year after the year in which the taxes are paid such additional amounts as are necessary to place the Employee in the same after-tax financial position that he would have been in if he had not incurred any such tax liability.  
  
(d) 

The payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Agreement are intended to constitute a short-term deferral pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus not “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A. If the payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 of this Agreement are deemed to provide for the payment of non-qualified deferred compensation benefits in connection with a separation of service under Section 409A(2)(a)(i) of the Code, the following interpretations apply to Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5: (i) Any termination of the Employee’s employment triggering payment of benefits under Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 must constitute a “separation from service” under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(h) before distribution of such benefits can commence. To the extent that the termination of Employee’s employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(h) (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to be provided by Employee to the Company at the time the Employee’s employment terminates, any benefits payable under Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 that constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(h). For purposes of clarification, this Section 5.6(d) shall not cause any forfeiture of benefits on the Employee’s part, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a “separation from service” occurs; (ii) If the Employee is a “specified employee” (as that term is used in Section 409A of the Code and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder) on the date his separation from service becomes effective, any benefits payable under Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until the earlier of (A) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (B) the date of his death, but only to the extent necessary to avoid such penalties under Section 409A of the Code. On the earlier of (A) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (B) the Employee’s death, the Company shall pay the Employee in a lump sum the aggregate value of the non-qualified deferred compensation that the Company otherwise would have paid to the Employee prior to that date under Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Agreement; (iii) It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Sections 5.2(b), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate “payment” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code; (iv) Neither the Company nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A of the Code); and (v) to the extent that the period between the Termination Date and the date upon which payment is required to be made or commence begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, payment will be made or commence in the second calendar year.

* * *

5.7 

Release of Claims. The Employee’s entitlement to severance, payment of COBRA premiums, and accelerated vesting of options, restricted share units and other equity incentive awards, is contingent upon the Employee’s execution of a general release of claims in a form prepared by the Company and presented to the Employee upon termination of his employment hereunder, as well as the Employee’s compliance with the provisions of Section 7 hereof.  
  
5.8 

No Requirement to Mitigate. The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 5 by seeking other employment or otherwise.

the relocation of the Employee to a location which is a material distance from Cranbury, New Jersey.  
  
(f) 

For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall be interpreted in a manner, and limited to the extent necessary, so that it will not cause adverse tax consequences for either party with respect to Section 409A, and any successor statute, regulation and guidance thereto.
