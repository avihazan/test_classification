WHEREAS, BGI, Borders, Walden, WPI, BPI, Planet, OnlineLLC, Outlet, Fulfillment, Library and OnlineInc are parties to that certain Guarantee, dated as of November 22, 1995, which was Amended and Restated as of October 17, 1997 and further amended by the Omnibus Amendment (as heretofore amended, the “Guarantee”); 

WHEREAS, at the Lessees’ and the Guarantors’ request, the parties hereto, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, have agreed to amend the Credit Agreement as set forth herein; 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ss.1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein without definition that are defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the same meanings herein as in the Credit Agreement.

ss.2. Amendments to the Credit Agreement. (a) The definition of "Restricted Payment Amount" set forth in Appendix A to the Credit Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

“Restricted Payment Amount.” means (a) over the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement, an amount not to exceed the sum of (i) $100,000,000 plus (ii) the aggregate amount paid to the Company (whether in cash or in shares of the Company’s stock), from time to time and at any time since the Omnibus Amendment Effective Date, by officers, employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the exercise of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, plus (iii) the realized tax benefit (as calculated by the Company in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) for tax years ending after the Omnibus Amendment Effective Date, resulting from the exercise, from time to time and at any time since the Omnibus Amendment Effective Date, of such options or resulting from the lapse, from time to time and at any time since the Omnibus Amendment Effective Date, of restrictions on (and vesting of rights in) certain shares of the Company’s stock subject to the Management Stock Purchase Plan or any similar successor plan and (b) during any Fiscal Year, an amount not to exceed the sum of (i) $50,000,000 plus (ii) the aggregate amount paid to the Company (whether in cash or in shares of the Company’s stock), from time to time and at any time during such Fiscal Year, by officers, employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the exercise of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, plus (iii) the realized tax benefit (as calculated by the Company in a manner satisfactory to the Bank Agents) for such Fiscal Year, resulting from the exercise, from time to time and at any time since January 28, 2002, of such options or resulting from the lapse, from time to time and at any time since January 28, 2002, of restrictions on (and vesting of rights in) certain shares of the Company’s stock subject to the Management Stock Purchase Plan or any similar successor plan. For purposes of calculating the Restricted Payment Amount, to the extent shares of the Company’s stock are delivered to the Company in payment of the exercise price of options, or in payment of taxes associated with the exercise of options or the vesting of restricted shares, such delivered shares are deemed to be repurchased by the Company at fair market value (as defined in the Company’s stock option plan) on the date of delivery to the Company. Such delivered share repurchases will serve to reduce the available Restricted Payment Amount.   
  


(b) Section 5.02 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the date "November 1, 2002" that appears in the second proviso at the end of the first sentence thereof, and substituting therefor the date "December 1, 2002".
