The Animas Corporation 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has decided to make a stock option grant as an inducement for the Grantee to promote the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to share in the growth and value of the Company. A copy of the Plan is attached. 

The Board is authorized to appoint a committee to administer the Plan. If a committee is appointed, all references in this Agreement to the “Board” shall be deemed to refer to the committee. 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

The Option shall become exercisable according to Paragraph 2 below. 

(b) This Option is intended to be a nonstatutory stock option and is not intended to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or to otherwise qualify for any special tax benefits to the Grantee. 

2\. Exercisability of Option. The Option shall become exercisable on the following date(s), if the Grantee is employed by, or providing service to, the Company on the applicable date:

(b) The Option shall automatically terminate upon the happening of the first of the following events: 

(i) The expiration of the 90-day period after the Grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company, if the termination is for any reason other than Disability (as defined in the Plan), death or Cause (as defined in the Plan). 

(ii) The expiration of the two-year period after the Grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company on account of the Grantee’s Disability.

4\. Exercise Procedures. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the Grantee may exercise part or all of the exercisable Option by giving the Board written notice of intent to exercise in the manner provided in this Agreement, specifying the number of Shares as to which the Option is to be exercised. 

(b) On the delivery date, the Grantee shall pay the exercise price (i) in cash, (ii) with the approval of the Board, by delivering Shares of the Company which shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of delivery, or (iii) by such other method as the Board may approve, including payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The Board may impose from time to time such limitations, as it deems appropriate on the use of Shares of the Company to exercise the Option. 

(c) The Company may require that the Grantee (or other person exercising the Option after the Grantee’s death) represent that the Grantee is purchasing Shares for the Grantee’s own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the Shares, or such other representation as the Board deems appropriate. 

(d) The Company may from time to time impose any conditions on the exercise of the Option as it reasonably deems necessary or advisable to ensure that all rights granted under the Plan satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 16b-3 or any successor rule. 

(e) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees to execute any shareholder’s agreement that may be applicable to holders of Shares under the Plan generally and restricts the Grantee’s rights in the Shares acquired under the Plan, in a form that the Company provides at any time on or after the exercise of this Option and as may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time. 

(f) All obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be subject to the rights of the Company as set forth in the Plan to withhold amounts required to be withheld for any taxes, if applicable. Subject to Board approval, the Grantee may elect to satisfy any income tax withholding obligation of the Company with respect to the Option by having Shares withheld up to an amount that does not exceed the applicable withholding tax rate for federal (including FICA), state and local tax liabilities. 

(g) The obligation of the Company to deliver Shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the Board, including such actions as Company counsel shall deem necessary or appropriate to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations.
