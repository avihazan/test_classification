A. Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be a period of 28 months, commencing on the date of closing under that certain Plan and Agreement of Merger (the “Merger Transaction”) by and among Employer, UB Acquisition Corp. and ubroadcast, Inc.

If, on the sixth-month anniversary of the closing of the Merger Transaction, Employer shall not have deposited the sum of $325,000 into the Escrow Account, the term of this Agreement shall be extended for an additional two (2) months.

B. Termination. Employer agrees not to terminate this Agreement except for “just cause”. For purposes of this Agreement, “just cause” shall mean (1) the willful failure or refusal of Employee to implement or follow the written policies or directions of Employer’s Board of Directors, provided that Employee’s failure or refusal is not based upon Employee’s belief in good faith, as expressed to Employer in writing, that the implementation thereof would be unlawful; (2) conduct which is inconsistent with Employee’s position with Employer and which results in a material adverse effect (financial or otherwise) or misappropriation of assets of Employer; (3) conduct which violates the provisions contained in the existing Confidentiality Agreement or the Non-Competition Agreement between Employer and Employee; (4) the intentional causing of material damage to Employer’s physical property; and (5) any act involving personal dishonesty or criminal conduct against Employer.

If Employee should cease his employment hereunder voluntarily for any reason, or is terminated for just cause, all future compensation and benefits payable to Employee shall thereupon, without any further writing or act, cease, lapse and be terminated. However, all salary and reimbursements which accrued prior to Employee’s ceasing employment or termination will become immediately due and payable and shall be payable to Employee’s estate should his employment cease due to death.
