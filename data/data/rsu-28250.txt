Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the earlier of (i) Director’s death or disability (as determined above), (ii) Director’s failure to be re-elected to the Board after being duly nominated while serving as a member of the Board, or (iii) Director’s retirement from the Board pursuant to then existing Company policy for mandatory retirement. In the event Director’s membership on the Board is terminated for any other reason, the Committee that administers the Plan (the “Committee”) or its delegate, as appropriate, may, in the Committee’s or such delegate’s sole discretion, approve the acceleration of the vesting of any or all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restrictions, such vesting acceleration to be effective on the date of such approval or Director’s termination date, if later.

(d) Stockholder Rights. Director shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to shares of Stock subject to this Award unless and until such time as the Award has been settled by the transfer of shares of Stock to Director, except that the Director shall have the right to receive payments equal to the dividends or distributions declared or paid on a share of Stock at the same time as those dividends or distributions are paid to holders of Stock.

(e) Settlement and Delivery of Shares. Payment of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after vesting, but in no event later than thirty days after the vesting date. Settlement will be made by payment in shares of Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Stock if counsel to the Company determines that such sale or delivery would violate any applicable law or any rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any rule or regulation of, or agreement of the Company with, any securities exchange or association upon which the Stock is listed or quoted. The Company shall in no event be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the delivery of shares of Stock to comply with any such law, rule, regulation, or agreement.

3. Withholding of Tax. The Committee may make such provisions as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any taxes that it determines is required in connection with this Award. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, the Company shall reduce the number of shares of Stock that would have otherwise been delivered to Director by a number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.

4. Director Relationship. For purposes of this Agreement, Director shall be considered to be a Director of the Company as long as Director remains a member of the Board. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such membership on the Board, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Committee, or its delegate, as appropriate, and its determination shall be final.

5. Committee’s Powers. No provision contained in this Agreement shall in any way terminate, modify or alter, or be construed or interpreted as terminating, modifying or altering any of the powers, rights or authority vested in the Committee or, to the extent delegated, in its delegate pursuant to the terms of the Plan or resolutions adopted in furtherance of the Plan, including, without limitation, the right to make certain determinations and elections with respect to the Restricted Stock Units.

6. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors to the Company and all persons lawfully claiming under Director.

8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas.

9. Section 409A.
