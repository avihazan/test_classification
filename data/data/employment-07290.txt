4\. Termination for Cause; Disability; Death; Change of Control.

4.01 For Cause. Company shall have the right to terminate the employment of Executive hereunder at any time for cause upon written notice. For purposes of the preceding sentence “for cause” shall mean and be limited to the occurrence of any of the following acts or events by or relating to Executive: (i) any material breach of any obligations of Executive under this Agreement which remains uncured for more than twenty (20) days after written notice thereof by Company to Executive; (ii) habitual insobriety of Executive while performing his duties hereunder; (iii) theft or embezzlement from Company or any other material acts of dishonesty; (iv) repeated insubordination respecting reasonable orders or directions of Company’s Board of Directors, which remains uncured for more than twenty (20) days after written notice thereof by Company to Executive; or (v) conviction of a crime (other than traffic violations and minor misdemeanors). In the event of termination for cause, Executive’s Fixed Salary and Profit Bonus shall terminate as of the effective date of termination of employment after written notice thereof.

4.02 Without Cause. In the event that during the term hereof, Company discharges Executive without cause or in the event Company discharges Executive on written notice under Section 4.01 within six months after a Change of Control (as that term is hereinafter defined), Executive shall be entitled to receive a payment equal to 2.99 times Executive’s average annual compensation paid by Company (including Profit Bonus, if any) during the term of this Agreement (the “Severance Payment”). The Severance Payment shall be immediately due and payable to Executive in one payment.

hereunder for any consecutive period of 90 days or more from its commencement or for non-consecutive periods aggregating 120 days in any consecutive twelve-month period, then, in either such event, Company may terminate this Agreement at any time thereafter upon ten days’ written notice to Executive. Any payments to Executive under any disability insurance or plan maintained by Company shall be applied against and shall reduce the amount of the salary payable by Company under this Agreement.

4.04 Death. In the event of Executive’s death, this Agreement shall terminate effective as of the date of death.

4.05 Payment. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.02 and 4.05, in the event of termination of this Agreement under this Section 4, Executive’s Fixed Salary shall cease as of the date of termination and his Profit Bonus shall be prorated by multiplying by a fraction the numerator of which is equal to the number of days in the year prior to termination and the denominator of which is 365.

4.06 Change of Control. If during the term of this Agreement there shall occur a Change of Control, Executive may, during the six month period following such Change of Control, voluntarily terminate his employment and such termination shall, for purposes of all payments and benefits to be provided to Executive under this Agreement, be treated as a termination without cause. As used in this Agreement, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day on which a majority of the Directors of the Company do not consist of individuals recommended by Executive.

5\. Confidential Information; Non-Competition.

5.01 Confidential Information. Executive shall not, at any time during or following termination or expiration of the term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, disclose, publish or divulge to any person (except in the regular course of Company’s business), or appropriate, use or cause, permit or induce any person to appropriate or use, any proprietary, secret or confidential information of Company including, without limitation, knowledge or information relating to its trade secrets, business methods, the names or requirements of its customers or clients or the terms of any agreement between the Company and third parties, all of which Executive agrees are and will be of great value to Company and shall at all times be kept confidential. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Executive shall promptly deliver or return to Company all materials of a proprietary, secret or confidential nature relating to Company together with any other property of Company which may have theretofore been delivered to or may then be in possession of Executive.

ceases to be employed by Company, Executive shall not either directly or indirectly, engage, hire, employ, or induce or encourage to leave employment any employee of the Company. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event Executive’s employment is terminated for cause by Company pursuant to Section 4.01, or in the event Executive shall terminate his employment in breach of this Agreement, Executive shall not, within the boundary of the United States, without the prior written consent of Company in each instance, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, whether for himself or any other person and whether as proprietor, principal, owner, shareholder, partner, investor, director, officer, executive, representative, distributor, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, engage or have any interest in any entity which at any time during such term or such one year period is engaged in the business of providing products and services similar to those provided by Company.

5.03 Reasonableness. Executive agrees that each of the provisions of this Section 5 is reasonable and necessary for the protection of Company; that each such provision is and is intended to be divisible; that if any such provision (including any sentence, clause or part) shall be held contrary to law or invalid or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, or as to any one or more periods of time, areas or business activities, or any part thereof, the remaining provisions shall not be affected but shall remain in full force and effect as to the other and remaining parts; and that any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed, without further action on the part of the parties hereto, modified, amended and limited to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction. Executive further recognizes and agrees that any violation of any of his agreements in this Section 5 would cause such damage or injury to Company as would be irreparable and the exact amount of which would be impossible to ascertain and that, for such reason, among others, Company shall be entitled, as a matter of course, to injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation. Such right to injunctive relief shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies which Company may possess.

5.04 Survival. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.
