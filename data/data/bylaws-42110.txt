A consent signed under this section has the effect of action taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors and may be described as such in any document.

INDEMNIFICATION

  


The corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person or such person's testator or intestate is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, at the request of the corporation, for another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity while he or she was such a director or 

  
  


5

  


  


officer, (hereinafter referred to as "Indemnified Person"), against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein. 

  


The corporation shall advance or promptly reimburse upon request any Indemnified Person for all expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of any undertaking then required by applicable law by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person. 

Determinations with respect to indemnification and reimbursement of a person (unless ordered by a court) shall be made: (1) by the Board acting (a) by majority vote or action of a disinterested quorum of directors; or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, as directed by a majority vote or action of a committee of the Board, duly designated to act in the matter by a majority vote or action of the full Board (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to such proceeding; or (2) by independent legal counsel, selected by the Board or a committee thereof by vote or action as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of clause (1), or if the requisite quorum of the full Board cannot be obtained therefor and such committee cannot be established, by a majority vote or action of the full Board (in which selection directors who are parties may participate); or (3) by a majority vote of the holders of the outstanding stock at the time entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class; or (4) by any other method of determination selected by the Board (in which selection directors who are parties may participate). 

  


Nothing herein shall limit or affect any right of any Indemnified Person otherwise than hereunder to indemnification or expenses, including attorneys' fees, under any statute, rule, regulation, certificate of incorporation, Bylaw, insurance policy, contract or otherwise.

  


Anything in these Bylaws to the contrary notwithstanding, no elimination of this Bylaw, and no amendment of this Bylaw adversely affecting the right of any Indemnified Person to indemnification or advancement or reimbursement of expenses hereunder, shall be effective until the 60th day following the taking of such action, and no elimination of or amendment to this Bylaw shall thereafter deprive any Indemnified Person of his or her rights hereunder arising out of alleged or actual occurrences, acts or failures to act occurring prior to such 60th day. Upon taking any such action the corporation shall promptly notify all Indemnified Parties, which notification shall be sufficient if mailed, postage prepaid, to each such Indemnified Person at their last known address. 

  


The corporation shall not, except by elimination or amendment of this Bylaw in a manner consistent with the preceding paragraph and Article X of these Bylaws, and except by making any determination required by the New Hampshire Business Corporation Act take any corporate action or enter into any agreement which prohibits, or otherwise limits the rights of any Indemnified Person to, indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Bylaw. The indemnification of any Indemnified Person provided by this Bylaw shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and such Indemnified Person and shall continue after such Indemnified Person has ceased to be a director or officer of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnified Person's heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. If the corporation fails timely to make any payment pursuant to the indemnification and advancement or reimbursement of expenses provisions of this Article IX and an Indemnified Person commences an action or proceeding to recover such payment, the corporation in addition shall reimburse such Indemnified Person for the legal fees and other expenses of such action or proceeding if the Indemnified Party shall prevail in such action or proceeding.

In case any provision in this Bylaw shall be determined at any time to be unenforceable in any respect, the other provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

  


For purposes of this Bylaw, the corporation shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnified Person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by such Indemnified Person of his or her duties to the corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such Indemnified Person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan. Such Indemnified Person shall be indemnified against excise taxes assessed on him or her with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law. For purposes of this Article IX of these Bylaws, the term "corporation" shall include any legal successor to the corporation, including any corporation which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation in one or more transactions. 

  


  


ARTICLE X

  


AMENDMENTS

  


These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed by vote of a majority of stock present and voting thereon at any meeting of the stockholders called for such purpose where a quorum is present or by written consent in lieu of a meeting, or by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors at any meeting of the Board of Directors called for the purpose or by unanimous written consent of the Board, except with respect to any provision which by law, the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws requires action by the stockholders.
