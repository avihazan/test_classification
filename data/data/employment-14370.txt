Notwithstanding the foregoing if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(b) Complete Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior correspondence or document evidencing negotiations between the parties, whether written or oral, and any and all understandings , agreements or representations by or among the parties, whether written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(c) Construction. The Executive and the Company have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Executive and the Company and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder , unless the context requires otherwise. The word including shall mean “including without limitation.”

8  
  
(d) Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive and the Company and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, representatives and estate; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of the Executive under this Agreement shall not be assigned without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole discretion. The Company may (i) assign any or all of its respective rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its respective obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases the Company nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of their obligations hereunder) , (iii) collaterally assign any or all of its respective rights and interests hereunder to one or more lenders of the Company or its Affiliates , (iv) assign its respective rights hereunder in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its business or assets (whether by merger, sale of stock or assets, recapitalization or otherwise) and (v) merge any of the Affiliates with or into the Company (or vice versa) .

(iii) Notwithstanding clauses (i)-(ii), the parties intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the covenants contained in Section 6 upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants.

(g) Amendment and Waiver. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended and waived only with the prior written consent of the Company, the Executive and Holding, and no course of conduct or failure or delay in enforcing the provisions of this Agreement shall affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
