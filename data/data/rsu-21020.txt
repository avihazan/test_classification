The remaining 75% of the Shares shall vest in equal 25% increments on each anniversary of the Initial Vesting Date (each, a “Subsequent Vesting Date”) as long as the Participant is employed by the Company on each such Subsequent Vesting Date.

(b) In the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, prior to the final Subsequent Vesting Date, all of the Unvested Shares (as defined below) as of the time of such employment termination shall be forfeited immediately and automatically to the Company, without the payment of any consideration to the Participant, effective as of immediately following such termination of employment. 

“Unvested Shares” means the total number of Shares multiplied by the Applicable Percentage (as defined below) at the time the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company. 

“Applicable Percentage” shall be 100% prior to the Initial Vesting Date, and shall be reduced by 25% on the Initial Vesting Date and on each Subsequent Vesting Date. The Applicable Percentage shall be zero on or after the final Subsequent Vesting Date.

(c) After the time at which any Shares are forfeited pursuant to subsection (b) above, the Company shall not permit the Participant to exercise any of the privileges or rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, but shall, in so far as permitted by law, treat the Company as the owner of such Shares.

(d) If the Participant is employed by a parent or subsidiary of the Company, any references in this Agreement to employment with the Company or termination of employment by or with the Company shall instead be deemed to refer to such parent or subsidiary.

3. Restrictions on Transfer. The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively “transfer”) any Unvested Shares, or any interest therein, except that the Participant may transfer such Shares (i) to or for the benefit of any spouse, children, parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, grandchildren and any other relatives approved by the Board of Directors (collectively, “Approved Relatives”) or to a trust established solely for the benefit of the Participant and/or Approved Relatives, provided that such Shares shall remain subject to this Agreement (including without limitation the forfeiture provisions set forth in Section 2 and the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 3) and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (ii) as part of the sale of all or substantially all of the shares of capital stock of the Company (including pursuant to a merger or consolidation), provided that, in accordance with the Plan, the securities or other property received by the Participant in connection with such transaction shall remain subject to this Agreement.

5. Rights as a Shareholder. 

Except as provided in this Agreement, for so long as the Participant is the registered owner of the Shares, the Participant shall have all rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares, whether vested or unvested, including, without limitation, rights to vote the Shares and act in respect of the Shares at any meeting of shareholders; provided that, as provided in the Plan, the payment of dividends on Unvested Shares shall be deferred until such times as the Shares vest.

satisfy such tax withholding obligations by transferring to the Company, on each date on which Unvested Shares vest under this Agreement, such number of Unvested Shares that vest on such date as have a fair market value (calculated using the last reported sale price of the common stock of the Company on the NASDAQ Global Market on such vesting date or, if such vesting date is not a trading day, on the trading date immediately prior to such vesting date) equal to the amount of the Company's statutory minimum tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of such Unvested Shares. Such delivery of Unvested Shares to the Company shall be deemed to happen automatically, without any action required on the part of the Participant, and the Company is hereby authorized to take such actions as are necessary to effect such delivery.

The Participant acknowledges that he or she has been informed of the availability of making an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, with respect to the issuance of the Shares and that the Participant has agreed not to file a Section 83(b) election.

8. Miscellaneous.
