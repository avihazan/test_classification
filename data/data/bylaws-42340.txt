SECTION 1.02. Other Offices.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

SECTION 2.01. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors of the Corporation, and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before such meeting, shall be held at such place, date and time as shall be fixed by the Board and designated in the notice or waiver of notice of such annual meeting; provided, however, that no annual meeting of stockholders need be held if all actions, including the election of directors, required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “General Corporation Law”) to be taken at such annual meeting are taken by written consent in lieu of meeting pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof.

SECTION 2.02. Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation, to be held at such place, date and time as shall be designated in the notice or waiver of notice thereof.  
  
SECTION 2.03. Notice of Meetings. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of each annual or special meeting of stockholders stating the place, date and time of such meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be held, shall be given personally or by first-class mail (airmail in the case of international communications) to each recordholder of shares entitled to vote thereat, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If, prior to the time of mailing, the Secretary of the Corporation (the “Secretary”) shall have received from any stockholder a written request that notices intended for such stockholder are to be mailed to some address other than the address that appears on the records of the Corporation, notices intended for such stockholder shall be mailed to the address designated in such request.

(b) Notice of a special meeting of stockholders may be given by the person or persons calling the meeting, or, upon the written request of such person or persons, such notice shall be given by the Secretary on behalf of such person or persons. If the person or persons calling a special meeting of stockholders give notice thereof, such person or persons shall deliver a copy of such notice to the Secretary. Each request to the Secretary for the giving of notice of a special meeting of stockholders shall state the purpose or purposes of such meeting.

SECTION 2.04. Waiver of Notice. Notice of any annual or special meeting of stockholders need not be given to any stockholder who files a written waiver of notice with the Secretary, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after such meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice thereof. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the grounds that the notice of such meeting was inadequate or improperly given.

SECTION 2.05. Adjournments. Whenever a meeting of stockholders, annual or special, is adjourned to another date, time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the date, time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat. At the adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

SECTION 2.06. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), the recordholders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders, whether annual or special. If, however, such quorum shall not be present in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time in accordance with Section 2.05 hereof until a quorum shall be present in person or by proxy.

SECTION 2.07. Voting. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, when a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the vote of the recordholders of a majority of the shares constituting such quorum shall decide any question brought before such meeting.

2  
  
SECTION 2.08. Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express, in writing, consent to or dissent from any action of stockholders without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary before such meeting of stockholders or such action of stockholders without a meeting, at such time as the Board may require. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon more than three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

SECTION 2.09. Stockholders’ Consent in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required by the General Corporation Law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, and any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the recordholders of shares having not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which the recordholders of all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

ARTICLE III

BOARD

SECTION 3.01. General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by stockholders.

SECTION 3.02. Number and Term of Office. The number of directors shall be two or such other number as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board. Directors need not be stockholders. Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders or, if, in accordance with Section 2.01 hereof, no such annual meeting is held, by written consent in lieu of meeting pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, and each director shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier death or resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided.

SECTION 3.03. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by delivering his written resignation to the Board, the Chairman of the Board of the Corporation (the “Chairman”) or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified in such notice or, if the time be not specified, upon receipt thereof by the Board, the Chairman or the Secretary, as the case may be. Unless otherwise specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

SECTION 3.04. Removal. Any or all of the directors may be removed, with or without cause, at any time by vote of the recordholders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, or by written consent of the recordholders of shares pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof.

3  
  
SECTION 3.05. Vacancies. Vacancies occurring on the Board as a result of the removal of directors without cause may be filled only by vote of the recordholders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, or by written consent of such recordholders pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof. Vacancies occurring on the Board for any other reason, including, without limitation, vacancies occurring as a result of the creation of new directorships that increase the number of directors, may be filled by such vote or written consent or by vote of the Board or by written consent of the directors pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof. If the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, such other vacancies may be filled by vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by written consent of all such directors pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof. Unless earlier removed pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof, each director chosen in accordance with this Section 3.05 shall hold office until the next annual election of directors by the stockholders and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.

SECTION 3.06. Meetings. (a) Annual Meetings. As soon as practicable after each annual election of directors by the stockholders, the Board shall meet for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business, unless it shall have transacted all such business by written consent pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof.

(b) Other Meetings. Other meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as the Chairman, the President of the Corporation (the “President”), the Secretary or a majority of the Board shall from time to time determine.

(c) Notice of Meetings. The Secretary shall give written notice to each director of each meeting of the Board, which notice shall state the place, date, time and purpose of such meeting. Notice of each such meeting shall be given to each director, if by mail, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, at least three days before the day on which such meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by telecopy, telegraph, cable, or other form of recorded communication, or be delivered personally or by telephone not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held. A written waiver of notice, signed by the director entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the meeting referred to in such waiver, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any meeting of the Board need be specified in any written waiver of notice thereof. Attendance of a director at a meeting of the Board shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except as provided by law.

(d) Place of Meetings. The Board may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board or the Chairman may from time to time determine, or as shall be designated in the respective notices or waivers of notice of such meetings.

(e) Quorum and Manner of Acting. A majority of the total number of directors then in office shall be present in person at any meeting of the Board in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting, and the vote of a majority of those directors present at any such meeting at which a quorum is present shall be necessary for the passage of any resolution or act of the Board, except as otherwise expressly required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws. In the absence of a quorum for any such meeting, a majority of the directors present thereat may adjourn such meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present.

4

The Secretary or, in the case of his absence, any person (who shall be an Assistant Secretary, if an Assistant Secretary is present) whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint shall act as secretary of such meeting and keep the minutes thereof.

SECTION 3.07. Committees of the Board. The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of such committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another director to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any committee of the Board, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board designating such committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided, however, that no such committee shall have such power or authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation (except that such a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation under Section 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all the Corporation’s property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or the revocation of a dissolution, or amending these By-laws; provided further, however, that, unless expressly so provided in the resolution of the Board designating such committee, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law. Each committee of the Board shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board when so requested by the Board.

5  
  
SECTION 3.08. Directors’ Consent in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing or by electronic transmission, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all the members of the Board or such committee and such consent or electronic transmission is filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or such committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

SECTION 3.09. Action by Means of Telephone or Similar Communications Equipment. Any one or more members of the Board, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the Board or such committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

SECTION 3.10. Compensation. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board may determine the compensation of directors. In addition, as determined by the Board, directors may be reimbursed by the Corporation for their expenses, if any, in the performance of their duties as directors.

Certificates shall be issued in consecutive order and shall be numbered in the order of their issue, and shall be signed by the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer.

SECTION 6.02. Stock Ledger. A stock ledger in one or more counterparts shall be kept by the Secretary, in which shall be recorded the name and address of each person, firm or corporation owning the shares evidenced by each certificate evidencing shares issued by the Corporation, the number of shares evidenced by each such certificate, the date of issuance thereof and, in the case of cancellation, the date of cancellation. Except as otherwise expressly required by law, the person in whose name shares stand on the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner and recordholder thereof for all purposes.

SECTION 6.04. Addresses of Stockholders. Each stockholder shall designate to the Secretary an address at which notices of meetings and all other corporate notices may be served or mailed to such stockholder, and, if any stockholder shall fail to so designate such an address, corporate notices may be served upon such stockholder by mail directed to the mailing address, if any, as the same appears in the stock ledger of the Corporation or at the last known mailing address of such stockholder.

SECTION 6.05. Lost, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates.
