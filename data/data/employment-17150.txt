(c) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by him of paragraphs 14 and 15 will be inadequate and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon adequate proof of a violation by the Executive of any provision of paragraphs 14 and 15, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further bread. Nothing in this paragraphs 14 and 15 shall be deemed to limit the Company's remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of paragraphs 14 and 15 which may be pursued or availed of by the Company.

    4.

Failure of Cedar Fair to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation and benefits from Cedar Fair in the same amount and on the same terms as would apply if the Executive was terminated other than for cause.

18\. Amendment or Modification; Conflicts.

No provisions of this Agreement may be amended modified, waived or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board.
