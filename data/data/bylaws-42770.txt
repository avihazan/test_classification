“8. NOTICE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.

(a) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record of the corporation. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year’s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or, in the event public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the corporation fewer than seventy (70) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation, and with respect to any annual meeting publicly announced by the corporation within sixty (60) days after adoption of the amendment to this Section 8 of Article I of the By-Laws on November 21, 2016, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. In no event shall the postponement of a meeting as to which the notice of meeting has been sent to stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above. A stockholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation’s books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business and (v) any other information that is required to be disclosed in a proxy statement by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (a) of Section 8 (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act). The chair of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a) of Section 8, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  
  
(b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) of Section 8 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of record of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) of Section 8. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 8\. Such stockholder’s notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in a proxy statement in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) of Section 8. The chair of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

(c) For purposes of this Section 8, “public announcement” or “publicly announced” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

2\. Except as set forth above, the remaining provisions of the By-Laws shall not be amended hereby and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.
