a. Right to Exercise. This Option shall vest and become exercisable as to one-third of the Shares on the first anniversary of the date of grant of this Option, and shall vest and become exercisable as to one-third of the Shares at the end of each twelve-month period thereafter. In the event of Optionee’s death, disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) or other termination of Optionee’s Continuous Status as a Director, the exercisability of the Option is governed by the applicable provisions of the Plan and the Appendix. 

b. Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form attached as Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be delivered in person or by certified mail to the Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price and any required withholding or other taxes as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price. 

No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation service upon which the Shares are then listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. 

3\. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee: 

a. Cash; or 

b. Check; or 

c. Delivery of a properly executed Exercise Notice, together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to the Company of the sale proceeds required to pay the Exercise Price; or 

d. Surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender; and (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares; or 

e. Any combination of the above methods. 

4\. Non-Transferability of Option and Shares. 

a. The Option may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee. As long as the Option or Shares purchased pursuant thereto is held by the Trustee on behalf of the Optionee in accordance with Section 4 of the Appendix, all rights of the Optionee over the Shares are personal, cannot be transferred, assigned, pledged or mortgaged, other than by will or laws of descent and distribution. 

b. If the Option is an Approved 102 Option, subject to the provisions of Section 102 and any rules or regulation or orders or procedures promulgated thereunder, the Optionee shall not be entitled to sell or release from trust any Share received upon the exercise

of an Approved 102 Option and/or any Share received subsequently following any realization of rights, including without limitation, bonus shares, until the lapse of the Holding Period required under Section 102 of the Ordinance. 

c.

5\. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan, the Appendix and the terms of this Stock Option Agreement. 

6\. Taxes. 

(a) Any tax consequences arising from the grant or exercise of the Option, from the payment for the Shares covered thereby or from any other event or act (of the Company and/or its Affiliates, the Trustee or the Optionee), hereunder, shall be borne solely by the Optionee. The Company and/or its Affiliates and/or the Trustee shall withhold taxes according to the requirements under the applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including withholding taxes at the source.

(b) The Optionee will not be entitled to receive from the Company and/or the Trustee any Shares allocated or issued upon the exercise of the Option prior to the full payment of the Optionee’s tax liabilities arising from the grant of the Options and/or the issuance of the Shares upon the exercise of the Option. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required to release any share certificate to the Optionee until all payments required to be made by the Optionee have been fully satisfied. 

(c) With respect to Approved 102 Options, the Optionee hereby acknowledges that he or she is familiar with the provisions of Section 102 and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, including without limitations the type of Option granted hereunder and the tax implications applicable to such grant.
