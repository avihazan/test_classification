6.1. Termination Due to Death. In the event of the Executive’s death, the Executive’s beneficiary (designated in writing to the Company) or estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to: (a) any Base Salary accrued but unpaid as of the date of the Executive’s death, (b) continued payment of the Executive’s Base Salary for an additional period of six months after the date of the Executive’s death; (c) an amount equal to Executive’s Bonus for the year of such death, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days transpired in the fiscal year up to and including the date of the death of the Executive, and the denominator of which is 365, which amount shall be determined and payable pursuant to the terms of Section 5.2; (d) payment, on the tenth day following such termination, of any unpaid expense reimbursements and unused accrued vacation days through the date of the Executive’s death; and (e) any other benefits which the Executive, the Executive’s estate or the Executive’s executor is entitled to receive under any of the Retirement Plans or Welfare Plans

6.2. Termination Due to the Executive’s Disability. Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Executive, the Company may terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder due to Disability.

In either such event, the Executive shall be entitled to: (a) any Base Salary accrued but unpaid through the date of termination; (b) Executive’s Base Salary for the remainder of the Term of Employment; (c) an amount equal to Executive’s Bonus for the year of such termination, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days transpired in the fiscal year up to and including the date of the Executive’s termination, and the 

5

* * *

  


denominator of which is 365, which amount shall be determined and payable pursuant to the terms of Section 5.2; (d) payment, on the tenth day following such termination, of any unpaid expense reimbursements and unused accrued vacation days through the date of termination; and (e) any other payments and/or benefits which the Executive is entitled to receive under any of the Retirement Plans or Welfare Plans. The Company may terminate the Executive with immediate effect pursuant to this Section, without providing thirty (30) days prior written notice, in which case it will pay the Executive thirty (30) days’ Base Salary in addition to the amounts set forth in clauses (a) through (e) above. For the purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), each monthly payment described in 6.3(b) shall be considered a separate payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any of the payments provided for in this Section 6.3 would be subject to an additional 20% tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code by reason of Executive’s status as a “specified employee” as that term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be delayed for the shortest period practicable (no less than 6 months following Executive’s termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason) in order to avoid such additional tax. The payments made pursuant to this Section 6.3 are in consideration of Executive’s covenants set forth in Section 11.3.

6.4. Termination For Cause. Upon written notice to the Executive, the Company may terminate the Executive’s employment for Cause. In such event, the Executive shall be entitled to: (a) any Base Salary accrued but unpaid through the date of termination; (b) payment, on the tenth day following such termination, of any unpaid expense reimbursements and unused accrued vacation days through the date of termination; and (c) any other payments and/or benefits which the Executive is entitled to receive under any of the Retirement Plans or Welfare Plans. The Executive shall be given the opportunity within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of such notice to cure such act or failure to act which constitutes Cause, but only if the Board deems such act or failure to act amenable to cure; otherwise, the termination for Cause is with immediate effect. Upon failure of the Executive to correct such act or failure to act within such thirty (30) day cure period, if applicable, the Company may proceed to terminate the Executive for Cause with immediate effect.

6.5. Termination Without Good Reason. Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Company, the Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment hereunder without Good Reason. In such event, the Executive shall be entitled to: (a) any Base Salary accrued but unpaid through the date of termination; (b) payment of any unpaid expense reimbursements and unused accrued vacation days through the date of termination; and (c) any other payments and/or benefits which the Executive is entitled to receive under any of the Retirement Plans or Welfare Plans.

6.6. Effect of Notice. Upon either party’s delivery of a notice of termination of Executive’s employment to the other, the Board, in its absolute discretion, may relieve Executive of all his duties, responsibilities and authority with respect to the Company and restrict Executive’s access to Company property.

6.7. Payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any payments to which the Executive shall be entitled under this Section 6 shall be made as promptly as possible following the date of termination.

6.8. General Release. The Executive’s receipt of the payments under Section 6.3(b) is contingent upon his timely execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release in a form satisfactory to the Company, which, among other things, shall include a general release of the Company from all liability and other terms deemed reasonably necessary by the Company for its protection.

6.9. Excise Tax Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with the Executive’s employment with the Company (or termination thereof) would subject the Executive to the excise tax imposed under Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), and if the net-after tax amount (taking into account all applicable taxes payable by the Executive, including any Excise Tax) that the Executive would receive with respect to such payments or benefits does not exceed the net-after tax amount the Executive would receive if the amount of such payment and benefits were reduced to the maximum amount which could otherwise be payable to the Executive without the imposition of the Excise Tax, then, to the extent necessary to eliminate the imposition of the Excise Tax, (i) such cash payments and benefits shall first be reduced (if necessary, to zero) and (ii) all other non-cash payments and benefits shall next be reduced.

7. Non-exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, policy or program provided or maintained by the Company and/or any Affiliate and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise prejudice such rights as the Executive may have under any other existing or future agreements with the Company and/or any Affiliate, including, without limitation, any equity agreements or plans. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plans or programs of the Company and/or any Affiliate at or subsequent to the date of termination shall be payable in accordance with such plans or programs.

8. Full Settlement. The Company’s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against the Executive or others.

9. Successors.

9.1. The Executive. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and, without the prior express written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Executive, except that the Executive’s rights to receive any compensation or benefits under this Agreement may be transferred or disposed of pursuant to testamentary disposition, intestate succession or pursuant to a domestic relations order. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s heirs, beneficiaries and/or executors.

Any reimbursement in any taxable year pursuant to indemnification under this Section 10 shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year.

11. Restrictive Covenants.

11.1. Protection of the Company’s Interests. To the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights worldwide with respect to any intellectual or other property of any nature conceived, developed, produced, created, suggested or acquired by Executive as a result of Executive’s employment with the Company or any Affiliate, or through the use of the Company’s or such Affiliate’s equipment, facilities, trade secrets or confidential information during the period commencing on the date of Executive’s employment with the Company and ending upon termination of the Term of Employment shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company and any such intellectual or other property shall be deemed to be works made for hire. Executive agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company at the Company’s request, such further documents as the Company finds appropriate to evidence the Company’s rights in such property.

During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending 12 months following termination of the Executive’s employment (the “Non-Compete Period”), the Executive covenants and agrees not to, and shall cause his controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly and anywhere in the United States or the world, conduct, manage, operate, be employed by or otherwise connected in any manner with, or engage in, or have an ownership interest in any business or enterprise engaged in, whether as principal, manager, employee, agent, consultant, officer, equity holder, partner, investor, lender or member or in any other capacity, any business or enterprise (or subsidiary or division thereof) which at any relevant time during the Non-Compete Period directly or indirectly competes with the Business of the Company or its Affiliates (collectively, the “Protected Companies”), in any geographic location in which the Protected Companies are conducting business. For purposes of this Agreement, “Business” shall mean any business or enterprise engaged in (i) the development, design, engineering, manufacture, sale and provision of flat panel display systems, flight information computers and advanced monitoring systems to the U.S. Department of Defense, government agencies, defense contractors, commercial air transport carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and the corporate/general aviation markets, and the integration of any such systems or computers with other flight information systems (ii) any business that uses any trademark, tradenames or slogan similar to the “Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc.” or “IS&S;” trademarks, tradenames or slogans, or (iii) any activities that are otherwise competitive with the business of the Company and/or its affiliates, including any products or services that are being created, developed or modified or any new end market entries that are being planned with respect to existing products or services, at any relevant time during the Term of Employment.

11.3.2. During the Non-Compete Period, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, call-on, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any customer or other business relationship of any of the Protected Companies for the provision of products or services, related to the Business engaged in by any of the Protected Companies prior to the termination of the Term of Employment, or in any other manner that would interfere with the business relationship between any such Protected Company and its customers and other business relationships.

11.3.3. During the Non-Compete Period, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, call-on, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any employee, staff, independent contractor or consultant of any of the Protected Companies to leave his or her employ or service with the Company or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, nor shall the Executive offer or provide employment (whether such employment is for the Executive or any other business or enterprise), either on a full-time, part-time or consulting basis, to any person who then currently is, or who within six months immediately prior thereto was, an employee of or staffed with any of the Protected Companies; provided, however, that the Executive shall not be restricted from conducting any general solicitation for employees or public advertising of employment opportunities (including through the use of employment agencies) not specifically directed at any such persons, provided further, however, that the Executive shall not, and shall cause his affiliates not to, hire any such person who responds to any such general solicitation or public advertising.

* * *

  


11.3.4. During the Term of Employment and thereafter, Executive, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall not directly (or through any other person or entity) make any public or private statements (whether orally or in writing) that disparage, denigrate or malign the other, their respective businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or prospects or any of their respective affiliates (including, in the case of the Company, its Affiliates, officers, employees, directors, partners (limited and general), agents, members or shareholders); provided that Executive may comment generally on industry matters in response to inquiries from the press and in other public speaking engagements. For purposes of clarification, and not limitation, a statement shall be deemed to disparage, denigrate or malign the Executive, the Company or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, if such statement could be reasonably construed to adversely affect the opinion any other person may have or form of such person.

11.3.5. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 11 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Protected Companies. The Executive shall not contest that the Protected Companies’ remedies at law for any breach or threat of breach by the Executive or any of his affiliates of the provisions of this Section 11 will be inadequate, and that the Protected Companies shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 11 and to enforce specifically such terms and provisions, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or equity. The restrictive covenants contained in this Section 11 are covenants independent of any other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement among the parties hereunder and the existence of any claim which the Executive may allege against any of the Protected Companies under any other provision of the Agreement or any other agreement will not prevent the enforcement of these covenants.

11.3.6. If any of the provisions contained in this Section 11 shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, then such provision shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be valid and enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law or the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.

12. Miscellaneous.

12.1. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, applied without reference to principles of conflict of laws.
