Congratulations! You have been granted an Award of EOG Resources, Inc. Performance Units as follows:  
  
Date of Grant:

[GRANT DATE]  
  
Performance Units granted under 

this Award (subject to adjustment as set forth below):

[# UNITS]  
  
  


The Compensation Committee of the Board of EOG Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) hereby grants to you, the above-named Grantee, effective as of the Date of Grant set forth above, a Performance Unit Award (the “Award”) in accordance with the terms set forth below.

General. This Performance Unit Award Agreement (this “Agreement”) is governed by the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated EOG Resources, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (as may be amended from time to time, the “Plan”), which is hereby made a part of this Agreement. All capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them under the Plan. Under the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, a Performance Unit ledger account will be maintained by the Company (or its agent) until you become vested in the Performance Units (i.e., the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions thereon) or the Performance Units are forfeited and canceled pursuant to this Agreement. 

Performance Period; TSR Rank; Performance Multiple. Upon the completion of the Performance Period (as defined on Annex A) and the certification (in writing) by the Committee of the Total Shareholder Return (as defined on Annex A) over the Performance Period of the Company and each Peer Company (as defined on Annex A) and the Company’s corresponding TSR Rank (see chart on Annex A) for the Performance Period and the applicable Performance Multiple (as specified in the chart on Annex A), such Performance Multiple shall be applied to the number of Performance Units granted hereunder and, except in the case of an applicable Performance Multiple of 100% or an applicable Performance Multiple of 0% (in which case all Performance Units granted hereunder shall be deemed forfeited and canceled), your Performance Unit ledger account shall be adjusted to reflect (i) the additional Performance Units credited to you (in the case of a Performance Multiple greater than 100%) or (ii) your decreased Performance Units (in the case of a Performance Multiple less than 100% but greater than 0%). 

After the application of the Performance Multiple, your resulting Performance Units shall continue to vest subject to the provisions of this Agreement (except in the case of an applicable Performance Multiple of 0%, in which case all Performance Units granted hereunder shall be deemed forfeited and canceled).

Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalents. You will have no voting rights with respect to the Company common stock represented by your Performance Units (including any additional Performance Units which may be credited to you upon the completion of the Performance Period based on the applicable Performance Multiple) until such time as the Company common stock is issued to you upon your vesting in the Performance Units. Dividend equivalents on unvested Performance Units shall accrue and be credited by the Company for your benefit, and any such dividend equivalents accrued and credited for your benefit through the date immediately prior to the date of certification by the Committee of the applicable Performance Multiple shall have the same Performance Multiple applied as is applied to your Performance Units. However, such dividend equivalents (as so adjusted) shall not be paid to you until you become vested in the related Performance Units and shall be forfeited in the event of the forfeiture and cancellation of the related Performance Units pursuant to this Agreement. 

Vesting. Assuming your continuous employment with the Company or an Affiliate, this Award shall vest on [five-year anniversary of grant date], and the shares of Company common stock represented (on a one-for-one basis) by the Performance Units granted hereunder (as adjusted for the applicable Performance Multiple, and on a one-for-one basis) and all dividend equivalents with respect to such Performance Units shall be distributed to you on the first business day following [five-year anniversary of grant date] or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than 60 days after such date.
