* * *

(B) RESTRICTION PERIOD – In General. Subject to the PARTICIPANT’s continued employment and the provisions of the PLAN (including Article XI) and this AGREEMENT, the restrictions on the RESTRICTED STOCK set forth in Section 2(A) will lapse and the shares of RESTRICTED STOCK will become fully vested with respect to:

(D) Lapse of RESTRICTION PERIOD. Upon the lapse of the RESTRICTION PERIOD, the COMPANY shall deliver a stock certificate for, or other appropriate documentation evidencing, the number of shares of COMPANY STOCK with respect to which restrictions have lapsed to the PARTICIPANT.

Section 3

RESTRICTED STOCK subject to PLAN; PLAN as Controlling.   
  
By entering into this AGREEMENT, the PARTICIPANT agrees and acknowledges that the PARTICIPANT has received and read a copy of the PLAN. All terms and conditions of the PLAN applicable to the RESTRICTED STOCK which are not set forth in this AGREEMENT shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference. In the event any term or condition of this AGREEMENT is inconsistent or conflicts with the terms and conditions of the PLAN, the PLAN shall be deemed controlling.

Section 4

Listing, Registration, and Qualification.   
  
If the COMMITTEE determines that (A) the listing, registration or qualification of the shares of COMPANY STOCK underlying the RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD upon NASDAQ or 

2

* * *

any other established stock exchange, market or quotation system or under any state or federal law; (B) the consent or approval of any government or regulatory body; or (C) an agreement by the PARTICIPANT with respect thereto, is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of the shares underlying the RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD, the shares may not be issued unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval, or agreement has been effected or obtained, free of any conditions which are not acceptable to the COMMITTEE. 

If any shares of COMPANY STOCK subject to the RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD are sold or issued upon the exercise thereof to a person who, at the time of such exercise or thereafter, is an affiliate of the COMPANY for purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the ACT, or are sold and issued in reliance upon exemptions under the securities laws of any state, then upon such sale and issuance: 

(i) Unless permitted by the PLAN such shares of COMPANY STOCK shall not be transferable by the holder thereof, and neither the COMPANY nor its transfer agent or registrar, if any, shall be required to register or otherwise to give effect to any transfer thereof and may prevent any such transfer, unless the COMPANY shall have received an opinion from its counsel to the effect that any such transfer would not violate the ACT or the applicable laws of any state; and

(ii) The COMPANY may cause each certificate evidencing such shares of COMPANY STOCK to bear a legend reflecting the applicable restrictions on the transfer thereof.

Any certificate issued to evidence shares of COMPANY STOCK as to which the OPTION has been exercised may bear such legends and statements as the COMPANY shall deem advisable to insure compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

(D) Nothing contained in this AGREEMENT or elsewhere shall be construed to require the COMPANY to take any action whatsoever to make the OPTION exercisable or to make transferable any shares of COMPANY STOCK purchased and issued upon the exercise of the OPTION.

Section 5

Tax Withholding.  
  
The COMPANY shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require the PARTICIPANT to remit to the COMPANY, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state and local taxes required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the PLAN. With respect to withholding required upon any taxable event arising as a result of this RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD, the PARTICIPANT may elect, subject to the approval of the COMMITTEE, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold shares of COMPANY STOCK having a FAIR MARKET VALUE on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory total tax that could be imposed on the transaction. All such elections shall be

irrevocable, made in writing and signed by the PARTICIPANT, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the COMMITTEE, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

Section 6

Rights of the PARTICIPANT During RESTRICTION PERIOD.  
  
During the RESTRICTION PERIOD, the PARTICIPANT (A) may exercise full voting rights associated with the shares underlying the RESTRICTED STOCK and (B) shall be entitled to receive all dividends paid with respect to the shares underlying the RESTRICTED STOCK; provided, however, that any dividends paid in shares of COMPANY STOCK will be subject to the same restrictions as the shares of RESTRICTED STOCK granted under this AGREEMENT.

Section 7

No Guarantee of Continued Employment.  
  
The grant of RESTRICTED STOCK under this AGREEMENT shall not: (A) confer upon the PARTICIPANT any right to continue in the employ of, or continue to provide services to, the COMPANY or any SUBSIDIARY; (B) limit in any way the right of the COMPANY or any SUBSIDIARY to TERMINATE the PARTICIPANT; or (C) be evidence of any agreement or understanding express or implied, that the PARTICIPANT has a right to continue as an employee, or advisor for any period of time or at any particular rate of compensation.

Section 8

Beneficiary Designation.  
  
The PARTICIPANT may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any shares underlying the RESTRICTED STOCK due to the PARTICIPANT upon the PARTICIPANT’s death. Unless otherwise provided in the beneficiary designation, each designation made will revoke all prior designations made by the PARTICIPANT, must be made on a form prescribed by the COMMITTEE and will be effective only when filed in writing with the COMMITTEE. If the PARTICIPANT has not made an effective beneficiary designation, the deceased PARTICIPANT’s beneficiary will be the PARTICIPANT’s surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the deceased PARTICIPANT’s estate. The identity of a PARTICIPANT’s designated beneficiary will be based only on the information included in the latest beneficiary designation form completed by the PARTICIPANT and will not be inferred from any other evidence.

Section 9

Governing Law.  
  
This AGREEMENT shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to the principles of conflict of laws.

Section 10

Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
