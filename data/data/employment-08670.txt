For purposes of this Agreement, Annual Compensation shall be deemed to include the Executive’s Annual Base Salary, plus any amount payable pursuant to the Executive Officer Incentive Plan. The Executive shall be paid by the Companies the Annual Base Salary provided on Schedule A attached hereto, which Annual Base Salary shall be paid biweekly.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Disability” means a mental or physical condition which (i) in the opinion of a physician mutually agreed upon by the boards of directors of the Companies and the Executive, will prevent the Executive from carrying out the material job responsibilities or duties to which the Executive was assigned at the time disability was incurred, and (ii) is expected to last for an indefinite duration or a duration of more than six months.

(b) “Change in Control” means a change in the ownership of the Company, a change in the effective control of the Company or TrustCo Bank, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company or TrustCo Bank, as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code, Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5), and any guidance or regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code. Subject to the foregoing, Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5) provides the following:

  


(i) a change in the ownership of the Company or TrustCo Bank occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B)), acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company or TrustCo Bank. However, if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company or TrustCo Bank, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the Company or TrustCo Bank (or to cause a change in the effective control of the Company or TrustCo Bank (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi)). An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this paragraph. This paragraph applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company or TrustCo Bank (or issuance of stock of the Company or TrustCo Bank) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction (see paragraph (c) below for rules regarding the transfer of assets of the Company);

* * *

  


(ii) a change in the effective control occurs only on the date that either: (i) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B)), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company or TrustCo Bank possessing thirty percent (30%) or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; or (ii) a majority of members of the Company’s board of directors is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company’s board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election; or

  


(iii) a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s or TrustCo Bank’s assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B)), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company or TrustCo Bank that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
