6\. Arbitration. The Participant and Forestar agree that this Option Agreement arises out of, and is inseparable from, the Participant’s employment or other service with Forestar or any of its Affiliates. The Participant and Forestar further agree to final and binding arbitration as the exclusive forum for resolution of any dispute of any nature whatsoever, whether initiated by the Participant or Forestar, arising out of, related to, or connected with Participant’s employment or other service with, or termination by, Forestar or any of its Affiliates.

3\. Exercise of Options:

a. Options shall only be exercisable at such times as provided in the Plan Documents and only to the extent that the participant is vested in the Shares subject to the Option pursuant to the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Option Agreement. 

b. Forestar shall not be required to deliver certificates or instruments for shares with respect to which an Option is exercised until the exercise price for the shares of Common Stock being purchased has been paid in full. 

c. In order to exercise an Option, notice must be provided to Forestar in such form as may be specified by Forestar. Such notice shall state that the Participant elects to exercise a specified Option, the number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which it is being exercised, and the manner of payment of the exercise price of the Option. 

d. The notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full Exercise Price of the Option with respect to the number of shares being purchased. The Exercise Price shall be paid in cash, by irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to Forestar cash equal to the Exercise Price of the Option, or unless otherwise provided in the applicable Option Agreement, in whole shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant, or partly in cash and partly in such Common Stock. Cash payments shall be made by certified or bank cashier’s check, or by the wire transfer of immediately available funds, in each case payable to the order of Forestar (or such other person or entity as may be specified by Forestar). Payments of the Exercise Price of an Option that are made in the form of Common Stock (which shall be valued at Fair Market Value) may be made by (i) delivery of stock certificates in negotiable form, or (ii) unless otherwise determined by the Committee, delivery of the Participant’s representation that on the date of exercise he or she owns the requisite number of shares and, unless such shares are registered in the Participant’s name as verified by Forestar’s transfer agent’s records, a representation executed by the Participant’s brokerage firm or other entity in whose name such shares are registered that on the date of exercise the Participant beneficially owns the requisite number of shares (“Certificateless Exercise”). Delivery of such a representation pursuant to a Certificateless Exercise shall be treated as the delivery of the specified number of shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that the number of shares issued to the Participant upon exercise of the Stock Option shall be reduced by the number of shares specified in the representation. In addition, to the extent permitted by the Committee in its sole discretion, a Participant may satisfy payment of the Exercise Price by forfeiting a number of Shares subject to and outstanding under the Option that, based on the Fair Market Value on the date of the exercise, are equal in value to the Exercise Price. 

e. Notwithstanding as otherwise provided in the Plan Documents, in no event may an Option be exercised after the Expiration Date. 

f. Except as provided in paragraph 5, a Participant may not exercise his Option unless such Participant is an Participant at the time notice is delivered to Forestar in accordance with paragraphs 3(c) and (d) above. 

g. The exercise of the Option shall be further subject to paragraph 12 herein. 

4\. Withholding: Forestar’s obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Option shall be subject to the satisfaction of applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. Unless otherwise prohibited by the Committee, and in accordance with rules prescribed by the Committee, each Participant may satisfy any such withholding tax obligation by any of the following means or by a combination of such means:

##### 

(a) tendering a cash payment; (b) authorizing Forestar to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise issuable to the Participant as the result of the exercise of an Option, or (c) delivering to Forestar unencumbered shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant. Shares of Common Stock that are withheld or delivered to satisfy applicable withholding taxes shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date the withholding tax obligation arises. Only the required statutory minimum tax may be withheld; excess tax withholding is not allowed. 

5\. Termination of Service: In the event of the Termination of Service of a Participant to whom an Option has been granted, the Option may, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 hereof, only be exercised following such Termination of Service as follows:   
  
Vested Option Exercise Treatment of Unvested  
Termination Period Shares  
  
Death 

12 months  Immediately Vest  
  
Disability 

36 months  Immediately Vest  
  
Retirement 

Until Expiration of Option  Immediately Vest  
  
For Cause 

None—All unexercised Shares   
are immediately forfeited  Forfeited  
  
Other 

3 months  Forfeited  
  
Options granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment so long as the Participant continues to be an employee of the Group. An Option Agreement may contain such provisions as the Committee may approve with respect to the effect of approved leaves of absence for employees. 

6. Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization: Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, in the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, split-up, spin-off, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or liquidation and the like, the Committee shall provide for a substitution for or adjustment in (i) the number and class of shares subject to outstanding Options, and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding Options. The Committee ‘s determinations with regard to the adjustments or substitutions provided for by this paragraph shall be conclusive. The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, make such amendments to the terms of Option Agreements as it deems necessary or appropriate to reflect any adjustments or substitutions made under the Plan or pursuant to this paragraph. 

7\. Change in Control: Notwithstanding any contrary waiting period, installment period or other limitation or restriction in any Option Agreement or in the Plan, the Shares under each outstanding Option granted under the Plan shall immediately vest, and the Option shall become exercisable in full, for the aggregate number of unexercised Shares covered thereby, in the event of a Change in Control. Any provision of the Plan Documents or any Option Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of a merger or consolidation to which Forestar is a party, the Committee shall take such actions, if any, as it deems necessary or appropriate to prevent the enlargement or diminishment of Participants’ rights under any Option, and may, in its discretion, cause any Option to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock that the Option covers (and has not previously been exercised) and (b) the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of cancellation over the Exercise Price of the Option. 

8. Nonalienation of Benefits: Except as required by applicable law, no right or benefit under the Plan or any Option shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, hypothecation, pledge, 

Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement 

-7-

* * *

##### 

exchange, transfer, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, hypothecate, transfer, pledge, exchange, transfer, encumber or charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit under the Plan or any Option shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such benefit. If any Participant shall become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge, exchange, transfer, encumber or charge any right or benefit under the Plan or any Option, then such right or benefit shall, in the discretion of the Committee, cease and terminate, and in such event, the Committee in its discretion may hold or apply the same or any part thereof for the benefit of the Participant or his beneficiary, spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the Committee may deem proper. 

9. No Right to Continued Employment; No Additional Rights: Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Option Agreement shall confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of Forestar or any of its Affiliates or interfere in any way with the right of Forestar or an Affiliate to terminate the employment or service of a Participant at any time, with or without cause, notwithstanding the possibility that the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable by such person under his or her Option (or Options) may thereby be reduced or eliminated. Nothing in the Plan Documents or any Option Agreement shall be construed to give any employee or other service provider of Forestar or any Affiliate any right to receive an award of Options or as evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that Forestar or any Affiliate will employ or retain the Participant in any particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration, or for any particular period of time. 

10. Exclusion from Pension, Profit-Sharing and Other Benefit Computations: By acceptance of an Option award under the Plan, a Participant shall be deemed to have agreed that any compensation arising from the Option constitutes special incentive compensation that shall not be taken into account as “salary”, “pay”, “compensation” or “bonus” in determining the amount of any payment under any pension, retirement or profit-sharing plan of Forestar or any Affiliate. In addition, each Participant shall be deemed to have agreed that neither the award, vesting, nor exercise of an Option shall be taken into account in determining the amount of any life insurance coverage or short or long-term disability coverage provided by Forestar or any Affiliate. 

11\. Non-Transferability of Option. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan Documents to the contrary, an Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of Participant, only by Participant or Participant’s guardian or legal representative and may not be assigned or transferred in any manner except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 

12\. Compliance with Securities Law. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan Documents to the contrary, the grant of the Option and the issuance of Common Stock will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state, or foreign law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Common Stock may then be listed. The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Common Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (1) a registration statement under the Act is at the time of exercise of the Option in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (2) in the opinion of legal counsel to Forestar, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. THE PARTICIPANT IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTICIPANT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS OTHERWISE EXERCISABLE. The inability of Forestar to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the

##### 

authority, if any, deemed by Forestar’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option will relieve Forestar of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, Forestar may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by Forestar. Notwithstanding as otherwise provided in the Plan Documents, if the exercise of the Option is prevented by the provisions of this paragraph, the Option will remain exercisable until 30 days after the date the Participant is notified by Forestar that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Expiration Date. Forestar makes no representation as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise. The Participant should consult with the Participant’s own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise. 

13\. Rights as Shareholder. Unless and until a certificate or certificates representing such Shares will have been issued by Forestar to Participant following the exercise of an Option, Participant (or any other person permitted to exercise this Option pursuant to the terms of the Plan Documents) will not be or have any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of Forestar with respect to Shares acquirable upon an exercise of this Option. 

14\. Applicability: These Terms and Conditions shall apply to all Options to which the Committee designates it as applying, and the Committee may designate it as applying to an Option in whole or in part in its discretion. 

15\. Plan Controls: In the event of any conflict between the Plan and the terms of an Option Agreement or the Terms and Conditions, the Plan shall govern.
