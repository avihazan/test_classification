INSPIREMD, INC.

  




  


1\. Grant of Option. Pursuant to this nonqualified stock option agreement (this “Agreement”), InspireMD, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), hereby grants to Sol J. Barer, Ph.D. (the “Optionee”) an option (the “Stock Option”) to purchase one million (1,000,000) full shares (the “Optioned Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value, $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) at an exercise price equal to $1.50 per share (the “Exercise Price”). The “Date of Grant” of this Stock Option is July 11, 2011. The Stock Option is a nonqualified stock option. The Company intends for this Stock Option and any payments made pursuant thereto, to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as a “short-term deferral” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), and agrees to interpret this Agreement at all times in accordance with such intent.

  


2\. Vesting; Time of Exercise. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Optioned Shares shall be vested and exercisable as follows: one hundred percent (100%) of the total Optioned Shares shall vest and that portion of the Stock Option shall be exercisable on the Date of Grant.

  


3\. Term; Forfeiture. The “Option Period” shall commence on the Date of Grant and shall expire on the earlier of (a) September 30, 2011, or (b) the date of the Optionee’s termination of service with the Company for any reason. The unexercised portion of the Stock Option will terminate at 5 p.m. on the date the Option Period terminates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company, nor the Optionee may, by agreement or otherwise, extend the Option Period for any reason beyond December 31, 2011.

  


4\. Who May Exercise. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 2 and 3 above, during the lifetime of the Optionee, the Stock Option may be exercised only by the Optionee, or by the Optionee’s guardian or personal or legal representative. If Optionee dies prior to the date specified in Section 3 hereof, and the Optionee has not exercised the Stock Option as to the maximum number of vested Optioned Shares as set forth in Section 2 hereof as of the date of death, the following persons may exercise the exercisable portion of the Stock Option on behalf of the Optionee at any time prior to the date specified in Section 3 hereof: the personal representative of his estate, or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Stock Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Optionee; provided that the Stock Option shall remain subject to the other terms of this Agreement and applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

  


5\. No Fractional Shares. The Stock Option may be exercised only with respect to full shares, and no fractional Share shall be issued.

  


6\. Manner of Exercise. Subject to such administrative regulations as the Company may from time to time adopt, the Stock Option may be exercised by the delivery of an exercise notice to the Company, in such form and substance as may be prescribed by the Company, setting forth the number of Optioned Shares with respect to which the Stock Option is to be exercised, the date of exercise thereof (the “Exercise Date”) which shall be at least three (3) days after giving such notice unless an earlier time shall have been mutually agreed upon. On the Exercise Date, the Optionee shall deliver to the Company consideration with a value equal to the total Exercise Price of the Optioned Shares to be purchased, payable as follows: cash, cashier’s check, or certified check payable to the order of the Company.

* * *

Upon payment of all amounts due from the Optionee, the Company shall cause certificates for the Optioned Shares then being purchased to be delivered to the Optionee (or the person exercising the Optionee’s Stock Option in the event of his death) at its principal business office promptly after the Exercise Date. The obligation of the Company to deliver such Optioned Shares shall, however, be subject to the condition that if at any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the listing, registration, or qualification of the Stock Option or the Optioned Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with, the Stock Option or the issuance or purchase of the Optioned Shares thereunder, then the Stock Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not reasonably acceptable to the Company.

  


If the Optionee fails to pay for any of the Optioned Shares specified in such notice or fails to accept delivery thereof, then the Stock Option, and right to purchase such Optioned Shares may be forfeited by the Optionee.

  


7\. Nonassignability. The Stock Option is not assignable or transferable by the Optionee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

  


8\. Rights as Stockholder. The Optionee will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the Optioned Shares until the issuance of a certificate or certificates to the Optionee or the registration of such shares in the Optionee’s name. The Optioned Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of such Optioned Shares. The Optionee, by his or her execution of this Agreement, agrees to execute any documents requested by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Optioned Shares.

  


9\. Adjustment of Number of Optioned Shares and Related Matters. The number of Optioned Shares covered by the Stock Option, and the Exercise Prices thereof, shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

  


a. In the event that the Shares of the Company are subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares, or if the Shares of the Company are exchanged for other securities of the Company, by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, stock or other property), stock split, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, change in corporate structure or otherwise, then the Optionee shall be entitled, upon exercise of the Stock Option and subject to the conditions herein stated, to purchase such number of Shares or such other securities of the Company as were exchangeable for the number of Shares of the Company which the Optionee would have been entitled to purchase had the Optionee exercised the Stock Option immediately prior to such an event, and appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Exercise Price per share to reflect such subdivision, combination or exchange.

  


b. Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event of a Transaction (as defined below), while unexercised Optioned Shares remain, the Company determines in good faith that adjustment is required in order to preserve the benefits or potential benefits to the Optionee, the Company may at its sole discretion (1) cause the Stock Option to be substituted with the corresponding and adjusted number of options to purchase shares of the surviving entity (or an affiliated entity of the surviving entity) - of the same class and the same substitution rate as the shares received by the holders of Shares of the Company in exchange for their Shares, or (2) in the event holders of the Shares received cash as consideration for their Shares in the Transaction, cause the Stock Option to be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to cash Optionee would have received had he exercised the Stock Option immediately prior to the Transaction, as adjusted for the payment of the appropriate exercise price. In the case of such substitution, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the quantity and exercise price to reflect such action, and all other material terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in force.

c. In the event that of any of the following events (each a “Transaction”):

  


(1) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any company (the “Successor Company”) resulting in the Successor Company being the surviving entity; or

  


(2) an acquisition of: (A) all or substantially all of the shares or assets of the Company in one or more related transactions to another party, or (B) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, in one or more related transactions to another party, in each case such acquirer of shares or assets is referred to herein as the “Acquiring Company”;

  


the Successor Company or the Acquiring Company shall have the right, among other alternatives, to substitute the Stock Option for its own securities (the “Substitute Shares”) or to retain this Agreement with no change. In the event the Successor Company or the Acquiring Company chooses to substitute the Stock Option for Substitute Shares, appropriate equitable adjustments shall be made in the purchase price per share of the Substitute Shares, and all other terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in force.

  


The Company shall determine the specific adjustments to be made under this Section 9, and its determination shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such adjustment shall be made or authorized to the extent that such adjustment would cause the Stock Option or this Agreement to violate Section 409A of the Code. Such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the rules of any securities exchange, stock market, or stock quotation system to which the Company is subject.

  


10\. Nonqualified Stock Option. The Stock Option shall not be treated as an “incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code.

  


11\. Voting. The Optionee, as record holder of some or all of the Optioned Shares following exercise of this Stock Option, has the exclusive right to vote, or consent with respect to, such Optioned Shares until such time as the Optioned Shares are transferred in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that this Section shall not create any voting right where the holders of such Optioned Shares otherwise have no such right.

  


12\. Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that remedies at law will be inadequate remedies for breach of this Agreement and consequently agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable by specific performance. The remedy of specific performance shall be cumulative of all of the rights and remedies at law or in equity of the parties under this Agreement.

  


13\. Optionee’s Representations. Notwithstanding any of the provisions hereof, the Optionee hereby agrees that he will not exercise the Stock Option granted hereby, and that the Company will not be obligated to issue any Optioned Shares to the Optionee hereunder, if the exercise thereof or the issuance of such Optioned Shares shall constitute a violation by the Optionee or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority. Any determination in this connection by the Company shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The obligations of the Company and the rights of the Optionee are subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

16\. No Right to Continue Service or Employment. Nothing herein shall be construed to confer upon the Optionee the right to continue in the employ or to provide services to the Company, whether as an employee or as a consultant or as an outside director, or interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company to discharge the Optionee at any time.

  


17\. Legal Construction.

18\. Covenants and Agreements as Independent Agreements. Each of the covenants and agreements that is set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as a covenant and agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action of the Optionee against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the covenants and agreements that are set forth in this Agreement.
