3.

Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

5.

Voting Rights; Distributions. So long as no Event of Default has occurred, the Pledgor shall be entitled to (a) exercise all voting, consensual, managerial and other rights in connection with the Collateral, and (b) take control of, receive and retain all distributions made by the Company in connection with the Collateral. 

  


6.

Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all Obligations shall immediately become due and payable without demand or notice of any kind, and the Company may, in addition to such other remedies provided herein, in the Note or by law or otherwise (a) transfer the whole or any part of the Collateral into the name of the Company or the name of its nominee and exercise all voting, consensual, managerial and other rights in connection with the Collateral, (b) take control of, receive and retain all distributions made by the Company in connection with the Collateral, (c) bring legal action against the Pledgor following written notice, and (d) take possession of the Collateral and sell, assign and/or give options to purchase all or any part thereof in one or more parcels upon any exchange or at public or private sale at the option of the Company at any time or times, without advertisement or demand upon or notice to the Pledgor or any other person or entity (all of which are hereby waived), except such notice as is required by applicable statute and cannot be waived, for cash, upon credit or for other property, for immediate or future delivery, at such price or prices and upon such terms as the Company shall, in its sole discretion, deem commercially reasonable, with the right on the part of the Company or its nominee to become the purchaser thereof at any such sale (unless prohibited by statute), free from any equity of redemption and from all other claims, and, after deducting all legal and other expenses for maintaining or selling the Collateral and all reasonable attorneys’ fees, legal or other expenses for collection, sale and delivery, to apply the residue to the proceeds of such sale or sales to pay (or hold as a reserve against) all Obligations. The Company shall have the right to take any action it deems appropriate without the necessity of resorting to any Collateral securing the Note. Any notice to be given to the Pledgor shall be sufficiently served for all purposes if placed in the mail addressed to or left upon the premises at the address noted in Section 8(h) below, and all time for service or delivery of any notice in accordance with any statute shall be deemed to be commercially reasonable if sent or served five (5) days before the event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pledgor recognizes that the Company may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Collateral and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Company than those of public sales, and agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Company has no obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral to permit the Company to register it for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall only be entitled to proceed against the Collateral and enforce its rights therein upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and, in such case, only to the extent of the outstanding Obligations. 

  


7.

Attorney-in-Fact. The Pledgor hereby appoints the Company, with full power of substitution, as his true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or in its own name, from time to time in the Company’s discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Pledge Agreement, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Pledge Agreement. 

  


8.

Miscellaneous. This Pledge Agreement is subject to the following additional provisions: 

  


(a)

The Pledgor hereby forever waives presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest and notice of dishonor of the Note and the indebtedness evidenced thereby and this Pledge Agreement. No delay or failure by the Company in the exercise of any right or remedy under the Note or this Pledge Agreement shall constitute a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Company of any right or remedy under the Note or this Pledge Agreement shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No modification or waiver of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Company, nor shall any waiver be applicable except in the specific instance or matter for which given. 

  


(b)

If any provision of this Pledge Agreement is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, but the foregoing shall not render invalid or unenforceable in such jurisdiction the remainder of this Pledge Agreement or the remainder of such provision or affect the validity or unenforceability of any provision of this Pledge Agreement in any other jurisdiction. 

  


(c)

The Pledgor hereby agrees, out of the proceeds of the Collateral to pay, indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all expenses, liabilities and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred by the Company in the protection, exercise or enforcement of its interests, rights, powers or remedies under the Note and hereunder.
