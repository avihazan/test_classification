* * *

  


Section 2.3 Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, unless notice is waived as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

Unless otherwise provided by law, and except as to any stockholder duly waiving notice, the written notice of any meeting shall be given personally or by mail, not less than ten nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If, however, the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 2.4 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereat, either present or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, but the stockholders present, although less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting to another time or place and, except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.3 of these Bylaws, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting.

Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of directors, is to be taken by vote of stockholders at a meeting, such corporate action shall, except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, be authorized if the votes cast by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereon in favor of such corporate action exceed the votes cast against such corporate action.

Except as otherwise provided by law, or by the Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock standing in the name of such holder on the stock ledger of the Corporation on the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

Upon the demand of any stockholder entitled to vote, the vote for directors or the vote on any other matter at a meeting shall be by written ballot, but otherwise the method of voting and the manner in which votes are counted shall be discretionary with the presiding officer at the meeting.

Any action required by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt written notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given t o those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

If such election occurs at an annual meeting of stockholders, the annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the same place and immediatel y following such meeting of stockholders, and no further notice thereof need be given other than this Bylaw.

ARTICLE V

Indemnification And Insurance

Section 5.1 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to any employee benefit plan (hereinafter an “indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agen t or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 5.3 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.

Section 5.2 Right to Advancement of Expenses. The right to indemnification conferred in Section 5.1 shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an “advancement of expenses”); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so a dvanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a “final adjudication”) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 5.2 or otherwise.

Section 5.3 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses,

8

* * *

  


in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right of an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee ha s not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article V or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 5.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, provision of these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 5.5 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Section 5.6 Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article V with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

Section 5.7 Contract Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators.

Section 6.4 Stockholder Record Date. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. 

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, (l) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the date on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held,
