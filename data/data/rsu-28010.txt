ARAMARK HOLDINGS CORPORATION

FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED

2007 MANAGEMENT STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

  


RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

(OPTION EXCHANGE)  
  
1.

Grant of Restricted Stock. The Company hereby grants the number of shares of Common Stock (the “Shares” and such Shares subject to the vesting and other restrictions contained in this Agreement, the “Restricted Shares”) set forth on the Certificate of Grant of the Restricted Stock Award attached to this Agreement and made a part hereof (the “Certificate of Grant”) to the Participant, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. This grant is made pursuant to the terms of the ARAMARK Holdings Corporation Fourth Amended and Restated 2007 Management Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which Plan, as amended from time to time, is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as in the Plan.  
  
2.

Vesting of Shares.  
  
(a)

Subject to the remainder of this Agreement, the Restricted Shares granted to the Participant under this Agreement shall become vested and nonforfeitable, on each such date as set forth on the Certificate of Grant under “Vesting Date”, so long as the Participant remains employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through such Vesting Date.  
  
(b)

Notwithstanding Section 2(a) of this Agreement,  
  
(i)

upon a Termination of Relationship as a result of the Participant’s death, Disability, or Retirement (each, a “Special Termination”), the installment of Restricted Shares scheduled to vest on the next Vesting Date immediately following such Special Termination shall immediately become vested and nonforfeitable Restricted Shares, and the remaining unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited; and  
  
(ii)

upon a Termination of Relationship for any reason other than as set forth in clause (i) above, all unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited and immediately cancelled.   
  
(c)

In the event of a Change of Control occurs prior to the date of a Termination of Relationship, all unvested Restricted Shares shall vest and become nonforfeitable.   
  
3.

Adjustments Upon Certain Events. In the event of any event described in Article VII of the Plan occurring after the Date of Grant, the adjustment provisions (including cash payments) as provided for under Article VII of the Plan shall apply. The Company shall,   
  
  


* * *

  


  


concurrently with the closing of a Public Offering, register all Restricted Shares by filing a Form S-8 with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.  
  
4.

Restriction on Transfer/Stockholders Agreement. The Restricted Shares may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant, except (i) if permitted by the Board or the Committee, (ii) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or (iii) pursuant to beneficiary designation procedures approved by the Company, in each case in compliance with applicable laws. The Restricted Shares shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. The Restricted Shares granted hereunder will be subject to the Stockholders Agreement. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Restricted Shares contrary to the provisions of this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement shall be null and void and without effect.  
  
5.

Data Protection. The Participant consents to the processing (including international transfer) of personal data as set out in Exhibit A attached hereto for the purposes specified therein and to any additional or different processes required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  
  
6.

Participant’s Employment. Neither this Agreement nor the grant of the Restricted Shares shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in their sole discretion, to terminate the Participant’s employment or to increase or decrease the Participant’s compensation at any time.  
  
7.

No Acquired Rights. In participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and accepts that the Committee or the Board has the power to amend or terminate the Plan at any time and that the opportunity given to the Participant to participate in the Plan is entirely at the discretion of the Committee or the Board and does not obligate the Company or any of its Affiliates to offer such participation in the future (whether on the same or different terms). The Participant further acknowledges and accepts that such Participant’s participation in the Plan is outside the terms of the Participant’s regular contract of employment and is therefore not to be considered part of any normal or expected compensation and that the termination of the Participant’s employment under any circumstances whatsoever will give the Participant no claim or right of action against the Company or its Affiliates in respect of any loss of rights under this Agreement or the Plan that may arise as a result of such termination of employment.  
  
8.

No Rights of a Stockholder. The Participant shall be the record owner of the Restricted Shares until or unless such Restricted Shares are forfeited pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but, subject to the Stockholders Agreement, shall not have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to such Restricted Shares; provided that any cash or in-kind dividends paid with respect to the Restricted Shares shall be accumulated by the Company and shall be paid to the Participant only when, and if, the Restricted Shares in respect of which such dividends were payable become vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   
  
  


* * *

  


  
  
  
9.

Securities Law Representations. The Participant acknowledges that, unless and until the Restricted Shares are registered under the Securities Act on a Form S-8, the Restricted Shares are not being registered under the Securities Act, based, in part, on either (i) reliance upon an exemption from registration under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act or (ii) the fact that the Participant is an “accredited investor”(as defined under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there under), and, in each of (i) and (ii) above, a comparable exemption from qualification under applicable state securities laws, as each may be amended from time to time. The Participant, by executing this Agreement, hereby agrees that the Participant shall make such representations as may be required to be made by the Participant upon any acquisition of Shares hereunder as set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, as such representations, if any, shall be required to be made at such time. The Participant further represents the following, as of the date hereof:  
  
The Participant represents and warrants that (i) such party has full legal power, authority and right to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, this Agreement, and (ii) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such party and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such party enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.  
  
•

The Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters are such that the Participant is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Restricted Shares.  
  
•

The Participant has had an opportunity to examine all documents and ask questions and receive answers from the Company regarding the terms and conditions of the Restricted Shares and the restrictions imposed on any Restricted Shares.  
  
•

The Participant acknowledges that he or she can afford to suffer a complete loss of his or her investment in the Restricted Shares, that any value it may have depends on its vesting and that investment in common shares of a closely held corporation such as the Company is non-marketable, non-transferable and could require capital to be invested for an indefinite period of time, possibly without return, and at substantial risk of loss.  
  
•

The Participant has read and understands the restrictions and limitations set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, the Plan and this Agreement.  
  
•

The Participant has not relied upon any oral representation made to the Participant relating to the Restricted Shares or upon information presented in any meeting or material relating to the Restricted Shares.  
  
•

The Participant understands and acknowledges that, (a) any certificate evidencing the Restricted Shares (or evidencing any other securities issued with respect thereto pursuant to any stock split, stock dividend, merger or other form of reorganization or recapitalization) when issued shall bear any legends which may be required by   
  
  


* * *

  


  


applicable federal and state securities laws, and (b) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or under the Stockholders Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement), the Company has no obligation to register the Shares or file any registration statement under federal or state securities laws.  
  
10.

Tax Withholding; Section 83(b) Election.   
  
(a)

The Participant will pay, or make provisions satisfactory to the Company for payment of any federal, state, local and other applicable taxes required to be withheld in connection with the vesting of all or any portion of the Restricted Shares as provided under Section 2 of this Agreement and to take such action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. If Participant has not made payment for applicable taxes prior to the vesting event applicable to the Restricted Shares, such taxes shall be paid by withholding Shares from the transfer of Shares due under this Agreement, rounded down to the nearest whole Share, with the balance to be paid in cash or withheld from compensation or other amount owing to the Participant from the Company or any Affiliate, and the Company and any such Affiliate is hereby authorized to withhold such amounts from any such issuance, transfer, compensation or other amount owing to the Participant.  
  
(b)

The Participant may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the Restricted Shares granted hereunder. The Participant should consult his or her tax advisor regarding consequences of such an election, as well as the receipt, vesting, holding and sale of Restricted Shares. In the event the Participant makes such an election, the Participant shall promptly notify the Company and furnish a copy of the completed election form. In the event Participant does not so notify the Company, the Company is hereby authorized, without liability to the Participant, to implement the provisions of Section 10(a) above in connection with the vesting of all or any portion of the Restricted Shares.   
  
11.

Restricted Shares Subject to Plan. By entering into this Agreement, the Participant agrees and acknowledges that the Participant has received and read a copy of the Plan. All Restricted Shares are subject to the Plan. In the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained herein and a term or provision of the Plan, the applicable terms and provisions of the Plan will govern and prevail.  
  
12.

All notices, claims, certifications, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and delivered if personally delivered or if sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier, by telecopy, email or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
  
17.

Waiver of Jury Trial; Legal Fees.

18.

Exhibit A

DATA PROTECTION PROVISION  
  
(a)

By participating in the Plan or accepting any rights granted under it, the Participant consents to the collection and processing by the Company and its Affiliates of personal data relating to the Participant by the Company and its Affiliates and/or agents so that they can fulfill their obligations and exercise their rights under the Plan, issue certificates (if any), statements and communications relating to the Plan and generally administer and manage the Plan, including keeping records of participation levels from time to time. Any such processing shall be in accordance with the purposes and provisions of this data protection provision. References in this provision to the Company and its Affiliates include the Participant's employer.  
  
These data will include data:

(i) already held in the Participant's records such as the Participant's name and address, ID number, payroll number, length of service and whether the Participant works full-time or part time;

(ii) collected upon the Participant accepting the rights granted under the Plan (if applicable); and

(iii) subsequently collected 

by the Company or any of its Affiliates and/or agents in relation to the Participant's continued participation in the Plan, for example, data about shares offered or received, purchased or sold under the Plan from time to time and other appropriate financial and other data about the Participant and his or her participation in the Plan (e.g., the date on which the shares were granted, termination of employment and the reasons of termination of employment or retirement of the Participant).  
  
(b)

This consent is in addition to and does not affect any previous consent provided by the Participant to the Company or its Affiliates.  
  
(c)

In particular, the Participant expressly consents to the transfer of personal data about the Participant as described in paragraph (a) above by the Company and its Affiliates and/or agents. Data may be transferred not only within the country in which the Participant is based from time to time or within the EU or the European Economic Area (“EEA”), but also worldwide, to other employees and officers of the Company and its Affiliates and/or agents and to the following third parties for the purposes described in paragraph (a) above:  
  
(i) Plan administrators, transfer agents, auditors, brokers, agents and contractors of, and third party service providers to, the Company or its Affiliates 

  


* * *

  


  


such as printers and mail houses engaged to print or distribute notices or communications about the Plan;

(ii) regulators, tax authorities, stock or security exchanges and other supervisory, regulatory, governmental or public bodies as required by law;

(iii) actual or proposed merger or acquisition partners or proposed assignees of, or those taking or proposing to take security over, the business or assets or stock of the Company or its Affiliates and their agents and contractors; 

(iv) other third parties to whom the Company or its Affiliates and/or agents may need to communicate/transfer the data in connection with the administration of the Plan, under a duty of confidentiality to the Company and its Affiliates; and 

(v) the Participant's family members, physicians, heirs, legatees and others associated with the Participant in connection with the Plan.

Not all countries, where the personal data may be transferred to, have an equal level of data protection as in the EU or the EEA. Countries to which data are transferred include the USA and Bermuda.

  


All national and international transfer of personal data is only done in order to fulfill the obligations and rights of the Company and/or its Affiliates under the Plan. 

  


The Participant may access, modify, correct or withdraw consent to process most Personal Information about the Participant by contacting the local data protection officer in the country in which the Participant is based. Please note, however, that certain Personal Information about the Participant may be exempt from such access, correction, objection, suppression or deletion rights pursuant to applicable data protection laws, if the Participant has a complaint regarding the manner in which personal information relating to the Participant is dealt with, the Participant should contact the appropriate local data protection officer referred to above.

  
  
  
(d)

The processing (including transfer) of data described above is essential for the administration and operation of the Plan. Therefore, in cases where the Participant wishes to participate in the Plan, it is essential that his/her personal data are processed in the manner described above. At any time the Participant may withdraw his or her consent.
