D. Vesting; Exercisability. The Options are vested by reason of the terms and conditions of the Original Grant.   
  
• Upon termination of employment for death or Disability, by Optionee while Retirement Eligible or as provided for under the Navient Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan for Senior Officers, all unvested Options will vest and vested Options (taking into account any vesting acceleration provided for, if any) are exercisable until the earlier of: (1) the Expiration Date; or (2) one year from the date of termination. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” has the meaning set forth in the SLM Long Term Disability Plan in effect immediately prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in the Separation Agreement). For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement Eligible” means Optionee meets the retirement eligibility requirements under Predecessor SLM’s retirement eligibility policy in effect as of the Original Grant Date, which shall be determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion.   
  
• Except as otherwise provided herein, vested Options are exercisable until the earlier of: (1) the Expiration Date; or (2) three months from the date of termination.   
  
• Upon termination of employment for Misconduct, any Options, vested or unvested, are forfeited. For purposes of this Agreement, “Misconduct” is defined as an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation or Predecessor SLM, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation or Predecessor SLM rules; an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation or Predecessor SLM trade secret or confidential information; any conduct constituting unfair competition; inducing any customer of the Corporation or Predecessor SLM to breach a contract with the Corporation or Predecessor SLM or any principal for whom the Corporation or Predecessor SLM acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship; or engaging in any other act or conduct proscribed by the senior human resources officer of the Corporation or Predecessor SLM as Misconduct.   
  
Optionee’s being an employee of NewCo from and after the Grant Date shall not be treated as a termination of employment upon the Separation under the Original Grant and the Separation shall not be treated as a Change in Control under the SLM Plan or the NewCo Plan. 

E. Expiration. These Options expire ten years from the Original Grant Date (the “Expiration Date”), subject to the provisions of the NewCo Plan and this Agreement, which may provide for earlier expiration in certain instances, including Optionee’s termination of employment.

Members” means children, grandchildren, spouse or common law spouse, siblings or parents of the Optionee or bona fide trusts, partnerships or other entities controlled by and of which all beneficiaries are Immediate Family Members of the Optionee. Any Options that are transferred are further conditioned on the Optionee’s transferees and Immediate Family Members agreeing to abide by the Corporation’s then current stock option transfer guidelines. The terms of these Options shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, and successors of the Optionee.   
  
G. Net-Settlement upon Option Exercise; Taxes. These Options shall be exercised only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each exercise must be for no fewer than fifty (50) Options, other than an exercise for all remaining Options. Upon exercise of all or part of the Options, the Optionee shall receive from the Corporation the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from the following formula: the total number of Options exercised less the sum of “Shares for the Option Cost” and “Shares for Taxes”, rounded up to the nearest whole share. “Shares for the Option Cost” equals the Option Price multiplied by the number of Options exercised divided by the fair market value of NewCo Common Stock at the time of exercise. “Shares for Taxes” equals the tax liability (the statutory withholding maximum) divided by the fair market value of NewCo Common Stock at the time of exercise. Optionee shall receive cash for any resulting fractional share amount. As a condition to the issuance of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation pursuant to these Options, the Optionee agrees to remit to the Corporation (through the procedure described in this paragraph) at the time of any exercise of these Options any taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation under federal, state, or local law as a result of the exercise of these Options.   
  
H. Clawback Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or an appropriate committee thereof, determines that, any material misstatement of financial results or a performance metric criteria of Predecessor SLM or the Corporation has occurred as a result of the conduct of any officer of Predecessor SLM or the Corporation at the Senior Vice President level or above (“Senior Officer”), or such Senior Officer has committed a material violation of corporate policy of Predecessor SLM or the Corporation or has committed fraud or misconduct with respect to Predecessor SLM or the Corporation, then the Board or committee shall consider all factors, with particular scrutiny when one the top 20 members of management are involved, and the Board or such Committee, may in its sole discretion require reimbursement of any compensation resulting from the vesting and exercise of Options and the cancellation of any outstanding Options from such Senior Officer (whether or not such individual is currently employed by the Corporation) during the three-year period following the date the Board first learns of the violation, fraud or misconduct.   
  
I. Board Interpretation. The Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive, and final all decisions and interpretations of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and, where applicable, the Compensation and Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) concerning any questions arising under this Agreement or the NewCo Plan.
