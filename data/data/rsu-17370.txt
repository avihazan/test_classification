(Employment Inducement Award) 

Dated as of August 15, 2012

THIS OPTION AGREEMENT is made by and between Xerium Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) and Harold C. Bevis (the “Employee”).

WHEREAS, the Employee has entered into an employment agreement, executed and effective as of the date hereof, by and between the Employee and the Company (the “Employment Agreement”); and

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement, the Committee desires to award a nonqualified stock option to the Employee as an “employment inducement award” (within the meaning of Rule 303A.08 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:  
  
1.

The Option Award. In accordance with the employment inducement award exception to the shareholder approval requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) set forth in Rule 303A.00 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, the Company hereby grants to the Employee a nonqualified stock option (the “Option”) to acquire 781,701 shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the “Shares”) at the Option Price per Share of $4.00, the Fair Market Value on the date of the grant (the “Option Price”). It is understood that the grant of such Option is not made pursuant to the Company’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) or any other equity-based incentive plan of the Company or its Affiliates; provided, however, that, unless inconsistent with the express terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be interpreted, and the Option shall be administered, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are herein incorporated by reference. The Option shall be exercisable, only to the extent that such Option is Vested, as provided in this Agreement. The Employee’s rights to the Option are subject to the restrictions described in this Agreement and the Plan in addition to such other restrictions, if any, as may be imposed by law. The future value of such Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. If such Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value.

Exercise of Option.

10.

Miscellaneous.  
  
(a)

Adjustments Based on Certain Changes in the Common Stock. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar change affecting the Common Stock, the Award shall be equitably adjusted in a manner that would not constitute a modification within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(a)(5)(v).  
  
(b)

No Rights as Stockholder. The Award shall not be interpreted to bestow upon the Employee any equity interest or ownership in the Company or any Affiliate or any rights as a stockholder.  
  
(c)

No Assignment. No right or benefit or payment under the Award shall be subject to assignment or other transfer nor shall it be liable or subject in any manner to attachment, garnishment or execution except as otherwise provided herein.  
  
(d)

Withholding. The Employee is responsible for payment of any taxes required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect to an Award. To facilitate that payment, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law, retain from the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the Employee on exercise that number of shares necessary for payment of the minimum tax withholding amount, valued at their Fair Market Value on the business day most immediately preceding the date of retention. To the extent the Company’s withholding obligation cannot

be satisfied by means of share withholding, the Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Employee.  
  
(e)

Employment Rights. This Agreement shall not create any right of the Employee to continued employment with the Company or its Affiliates or limit the right of Company or its Affiliates to terminate the Employee’s employment at any time and shall not create any right of the Employee to employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates. Except to the extent required by applicable law that cannot be waived, the loss of the Award shall not constitute an element of damages in the event of termination of the Employee’s employment even if the termination is determined to be in violation of an obligation of the Company or its Affiliates to the Employee by contract or otherwise.  
  
(f)

Unfunded Status. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be contractual only. The Employee shall rely solely on the unsecured promise of the Company and nothing herein shall be construed to give the Employee or any other person or persons any right, title, interest or claim in or to any specific asset, fund, reserve, account or property of any kind whatsoever owned by the Company or any Affiliate.  
  
(g)

Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable law.  
  
(h)

Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  
  
(i)

409A. The Award shall be construed and administered consistent with the intent that it be at all times in compliance with, or exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.

Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by mutual written agreement of the parties.
