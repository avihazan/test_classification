* * *

##### 

officer or director of any subsidiary of the corporation (except as set forth in Section 8 hereof), against all expenses, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. Except to the extent prohibited by law, the right of each officer and director to indemnification hereunder (x) shall pertain both as to action or omission to act in his or her official capacity and as to action or omission to act in another capacity while holding such office; (y) shall be a contract right and (z) shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in any such Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise. 

Section 2. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If the corporation receives a written claim under Section 1 or Section 5 which it has not paid in full within ninety days after it receives such claim, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring an action against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with (a) any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation or (b) any Proceeding in which the claimant was successful on the merits or otherwise) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Act”) for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of providing such 

* * *

##### 

defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant had not met the applicable standard of conduct.

The power of the corporation to indemnify each employee and agent hereunder (x) shall pertain both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office and (y) shall include the power (but not the obligation) to pay the expenses incurred in any such Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such 

* * *

##### 

Proceeding upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors of the corporation deems appropriate. 

Section 4. Procedure for Obtaining Indemnification Award. Except as set forth in Section 5, any indemnification under Sections 1 or 3 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, and, in case of any Proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, that such person shall have not been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, and, in the case of any indemnification under Section 3, because the Board of Directors in its discretion deems such indemnification appropriate. The determination referred to in this Section shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such Proceeding or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (c) by the stockholders or (d) any court having jurisdiction. 

Section 5. Indemnification of Expenses.
