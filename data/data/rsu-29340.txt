(ii) Termination as a Result of Death, Disability or Retirement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Recipient's status as a Service Provider to the Company terminates (i) as a result of Recipient's death or (ii) because Recipient suffers a Disability, then in each such case the Restricted Shares shall be deemed fully vested and shall become Vested Shares.

  


(iii) Preservation of Rights.
