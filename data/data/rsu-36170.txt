2. Limitations on Exercise of Option. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Option will vest and become exercisable at such times and on such dates (each, a “Vesting Date”) as are prescribed by the terms of the grant; provided, that, the Optionee is still employed or performing services for the Company on each such Vesting Date.

3. Term of Option. Unless sooner terminated in accordance herewith or in the Plan, this Option shall expire ten years from the date of grant or, if earlier, on the date set forth in the grant notification provided to the Optionee.

(b) At the time of exercise, the Optionee shall pay to the Administrator (or at the option of the Company, to the Company) such amount as the Company deems necessary to satisfy its obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the exercise of this Option. The Optionee may elect to pay to the Administrator (or at the option of the Company, to the Company) an amount equal to the amount of the taxes which the Company shall be required to withhold by delivering to the Administrator (or at the option of the Company, to the Company), cash, a check or, at the sole discretion of the Company, shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the amount of the withholding tax obligation as determined by the Company.

(a) If the Optionee’s termination of employment or service is due to death, this Option shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable in full and shall be exercisable by the Optionee’s designated beneficiary, or, if none, the person(s) to whom the Optionee’s rights under this Option are transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution for one year following such termination of employment or service (but in no event beyond the term of the Option), and shall thereafter terminate.

(b) If the Optionee’s termination of employment or service is due to Disability (as defined herein), the Optionee shall be treated, for purposes of this Agreement only, as if his/her employment or service continued with the Company for the lesser of (i) five years or (ii) the remaining term of this Option and this Option will continue to vest and remain exercisable during such period (the “Disability Vesting Period”). Upon expiration of the Disability Vesting Period, this Option shall automatically terminate; provided, that, if the Optionee should die during such period, this Option shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable in full and shall be exercisable by the Optionee’s designated beneficiary, or, if none, the person(s) to whom the Optionee’s rights under this Option are transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution for one year following such death (but in no event beyond the term of the Option), and shall thereafter terminate.

Upon expiration of the Retirement Vesting Period, this Option shall automatically terminate; provided, that, if the Optionee should die during such period, this Option shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable in full and shall be exercisable by the Optionee’s designated beneficiary, or, if none, the person(s) to whom such Optionee’s rights under this Option are transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution for one year following such death (but in no event beyond the term of the Option), and shall thereafter terminate. For purposes of this section, “Retirement” shall mean the Optionee’s resignation from the Company on or after the date on which the sum of his/her (i) full years of age (measured as of his/her last birthday preceding the date of termination of employment or service) and (ii) full years of service with the Company measured from his/her date of hire (or re-hire, if later), is equal at least seventy (70); provided, that, the Optionee must have attained at least the age of sixty (60) and completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company prior to the date of his/her resignation. Any disputes relating to whether the Optionee is eligible for Retirement under this Agreement, including, without limitation, his years’ of service, shall be settled by the Committee in its sole discretion.

The Optionee’s status as an employee shall not be considered terminated in the case of a leave of absence agreed to in writing by the Company (including, but not limited to, military and sick leave); provided, that, such leave is for a period of not more than three-months or re-employment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by contract or statute.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of this Agreement:

Such repayment obligation will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee. Any repayment obligation must be satisfied in cash or, if permitted in the sole discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal the gain realized upon exercise of the Option. The Company is specifically authorized to off-set and deduct from any other payments, if any, including, without limitation, wages, salary or bonus, that it may own the Optionee to secure the repayment obligations herein contained.
