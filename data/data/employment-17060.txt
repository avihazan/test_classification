##### 

agent, owner, employee, partner, investor, shareholder (other than solely as a holder of not more than 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of any public corporation), consultant, advisor or otherwise howsoever own, operate, carry on or engage in the operation of or have any financial interest in or provide, directly or indirectly, financial assistance to or lend money to or guarantee the debts or obligations of any Person carrying on or engaged in the hotel or casino business in or within one hundred (100) miles of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.

* * *

##### 

(the Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete sections respectively) would not be unduly burdensome to Employee and that such restrictions are reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company. Employee agrees that the remedy of damages for any breach by Employee of the provisions of either of these sections may be inadequate and that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief, without posting any bond.

This section constitutes an independent and separable covenant that shall be enforceable notwithstanding any right or remedy that the Company may have under any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise. 

8\. Benefits

During the Term of Employment, Employee shall be entitled to receive certain healthcare and other similar employee welfare benefits (including eligibility to participate in the Executive Medical Reimbursement Plan provided by the Company) comparable to those received by other employees of the Company at a similar pay level and/or position with the Company as such may be provided by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time within thirty (30) days hereof. In the event that, during the Term of Employment, the Company awards to its executives stock options or restricted stock in anticipation of a public offering, Employee shall be eligible to receive an award of such options or restricted stock comparable to that received by other employees at a similar pay level and/or position with the Company; provided, however, that the decision to make any such award to Employee and the amount of any such award shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion.
