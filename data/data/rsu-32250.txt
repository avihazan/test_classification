(i) In the event the Participant’s Service terminates due to death, Disability or Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, the outstanding Performance Shares eligible to vest in accordance with Section 3(b) shall become vested and non-forfeitable, on the date of certification of the achievement of Performance Goals by the Committee in accordance with Section 1 hereof, on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of (i) the number of complete months beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date of the Participant’s termination of Service, to (ii) twelve (12); provided, however that 

  


* * *

  


this provision shall not apply if the number of complete months beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date of the Participant’s termination of Service is less than six (6).

(ii) In the event the Participant’s Service terminates due to death, Disability or Retirement on or following the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, the outstanding Performance Shares eligible to vest in accordance with Section 3(b) shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the Participant’s termination of Service.

(iii) In the event of a Change in Control prior to the end of the Performance Period, and within one (1) year of such Change in Control the Participant’s Service is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Participant with Good Reason, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable at the Outstanding/Target level on the date of the Participant’s termination of Service.

When dividends are paid by the Company, the Participant shall be credited with an amount determined by multiplying the number of the Participant’s unvested Performance Shares by the dividend per Share, which amount shall be held by the Company and subject to forfeiture until the related Performance Shares vest in accordance with Section 3 hereof. Such dividends shall be paid to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days, following the settlement of the Performance Shares to which the dividends relate. The right to dividends shall be forfeited by the Participant without any consideration if the Committee does not certify in writing that the Performance Goal has been attained.

6. No Right to Continued Service. The granting of the Performance Shares 

  


* * *

  


evidenced hereby and this Award Agreement shall impose no obligation on the Company or any Affiliate to continue the Service of the Participant and shall not lessen or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the Service of such Participant.

7. Rights as a Stockholder. The Participant shall have none of the rights of a Stockholder of the Company unless and until the Performance Shares are settled for Shares.

8. Securities Laws/Legend on Certificates. The issuance and delivery of Shares shall comply with all applicable requirements of law, including (without limitation) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, state securities laws and regulations, and the regulations of any stock exchange or other securities market on which the Company’s securities may then be traded. If the Company deems it necessary to ensure that the issuance of Shares under the Plan is not required to be registered under any applicable securities laws, each Participant to whom such Shares would be issued shall deliver to the Company an agreement or certificate containing such representations, warranties and covenants as the Company may request which satisfies such requirements. The certificates representing the Shares shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem reasonably advisable, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

9. Transferability. The Performance Shares may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company and all Affiliates; provided, that, the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance. No such permitted transfer of the Performance Shares to heirs or legatees of the Participant shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions hereof.

10. Adjustment of Performance Shares or Performance Goal. Adjustments to the Performance Shares shall be made in accordance with Article 12 of the Plan.

Any such adjustments shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Participant.

19. Performance Shares Subject to Plan. By entering into this Award Agreement the Participant agrees and acknowledges that the Participant has received and read a copy of the Plan.

The Participant has had the opportunity to retain counsel, and has read carefully, and understands, the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement.

20. Amendment. The Committee may amend or alter this Award Agreement and the Performance Shares granted hereunder at any time; provided, that, subject to Article 11, Article 12 and Article 13 of the Plan, no such amendment or alteration shall be made without the consent of the Participant if such action would materially diminish any of the rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement or with respect to the Performance Shares.

21. Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.

22. Signature in Counterparts. This Award Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

23. No Guarantees Regarding Tax Treatment. Participants (or their beneficiaries) shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to the Performance Shares. The Committee and the Company make no guarantees regarding the tax treatment of the Performance Shares. Neither the Committee nor the Company has any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any tax under Section 409A of the Code or Section 457A of the Code or otherwise 

  


* * *

  


and none of the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or any of their employees or representatives shall have any liability to a Participant with respect thereto.

24. Compliance with Section 409A. The Company intends that the Performance Shares and right to receive dividend equivalents be structured in compliance with, or to satisfy an exemption from, Section 409A of the Code and all regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority thereunder (“Section 409A”), such that there are no adverse tax consequences, interest, or penalties under Section 409A as a result of the Performance Shares or payment of Dividends. In the event the Performance Shares or Dividends are subject to Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, take the actions described in Section 11.1 of the Plan. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or this Award Agreement, any payment(s) of nonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) that are otherwise required to be made under this Award Agreement to a “specified employee” (as defined under Section 409A) as a result of his or her separation from service (other than a payment that is not subject to Section 409A) shall be delayed for the first six (6) months following such separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the specified employee) and shall instead be paid on the date that immediately follows the end of such six (6) month period or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. A termination of Service shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of the Award Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A upon or following a termination of Service, unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and the payment thereof prior to a “separation from service” would violate Section 409A. For purposes of any such provision of this Award Agreement relating to any such payments or benefits, references to a “termination,” “termination of Service” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.”
