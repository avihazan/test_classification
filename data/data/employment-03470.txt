Group’s policies. UnitedHealth Group reserves the right to amend or discontinue any plan or policy at any time in its sole discretion. In addition to the Company’s generally available benefits, the Company shall provide Executive, at the Company’s expense during the term of Executive’s employment, a $2 million face value term life insurance policy and a long term disability policy which covers 60% of base salary in the event of a qualifying long term disability, subject to the policy terms.   
  
3. Term and Termination.   
  
A. Term. This Agreement’s term is from the Effective Date until this Agreement is terminated under Section 3.B.   
  
B. Termination.   
  
i. By Mutual Agreement. The parties may terminate Executive’s employment and this Agreement at any time by mutual agreement.   
  
ii. By UnitedHealth Group without Cause. UnitedHealth Group may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment without Cause upon 90 days’ prior written notice.   
  
iii. By UnitedHealth Group with Cause. UnitedHealth Group may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment at any time for Cause. “Cause” means Executive’s (a) material failure to follow UnitedHealth Group’s reasonable direction or to perform any duties reasonably required on material matters, (b) material violation of, or failure to act upon or report known or suspected violations of, UnitedHealth Group’s Principles of Integrity and Compliance, (c) conviction of a felony, (d) commission of any criminal, fraudulent, or dishonest act in connection with Executive’s employment, (e) material breach of this Agreement, or (f) conduct that is materially detrimental to UnitedHealth Group’s interests.

In any instance where the Company may have grounds for Cause, failure by the Company to provide written notice of the grounds for Cause within 120 days of discovery shall be a waiver of its right to assert the subject conduct as a basis for termination for Cause.   
  
iv. By Executive without Good Reason. Executive may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment at any time for any reason, including due to Executive’s retirement.   
  
* * *

v. By Executive for Good Reason. Executive may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment for Good Reason, as defined below. Executive must give UnitedHealth Group written notice specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Reason, within 120 days of becoming aware of such circumstances, or such circumstances will not constitute Good Reason. If the circumstances constituting Good Reason are reasonably capable of being remedied, UnitedHealth Group will have 60 days to remedy such circumstances. “Good Reason” will exist if, without Executive’s consent, UnitedHealth Group: (a) reduces Executive’s base salary or long or short term target bonus percentage other than in connection with a general reduction affecting a group of similarly situated employees; (b) moves Executive’s primary work location more than 50 miles; (c) makes changes that substantially diminish Executive’s duties or responsibilities; or (d) changes the Executive’s reporting relationship.   
  
vi. Due to Executive’s Death or Disability. This Agreement and Executive’s employment will terminate automatically if Executive dies. The termination date will be the date of Executive’s death. UnitedHealth Group may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment due to Executive’s disability that renders Executive incapable of performing the essential functions of Executive’s job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Executive will not be entitled to Severance Benefits under Section 4 in the event of termination due to Executive’s death or disability.   
  
4. Severance Benefits.   
  
A. Circumstances under Which Severance Benefits Payable. Executive will be entitled to Severance Benefits only if Executive’s employment is terminated by UnitedHealth Group without Cause or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason. The Severance Benefits in this Agreement are in lieu of any payments or benefits to which Executive otherwise might be entitled under any UnitedHealth Group severance plan or program.   
  
B. Severance Benefits. Executive will be entitled to the following Severance Benefits in the event Executive’s employment terminates under the circumstances described at Section 4A above:   
  
(1) two times the Executive’s annualized base salary as of Executive’s termination date. 

* * *

(2) two times the average of the total of any bonus or incentive compensation paid or payable to Executive for the two most recent calendar years (excluding equity-related awards, payments under any long-term or similar benefit plan, or any other special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments); provided, however, that if termination occurs within two years following the Effective Date, the amount payable under this paragraph will be two times the greater of (i) Executive’s target incentive, or (ii) the most recent year’s annual bonus after the first year anniversary of this Agreement. 

(3) $12,000 payment to offset costs of COBRA 

(4) Outplacement services consistent with those provided to similarly situated executives provided by an outplacement firm selected by UnitedHealth Group.

Executive and the Company agree that this Section 4 will not have the effect of extending the vesting period of any equity awards granted prior to the date hereof.
