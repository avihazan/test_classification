5. Unvested Restricted Shares. The Company will hold such Restricted Shares in escrow until vesting occurs. You will be reflected as the owner of record on the Company's books and records of any Shares issued pursuant to this Award Agreement.

To the extent that your Continuous Service ends before vesting of the Shares, you will forfeit all dividends (whether paid in cash or in stock) attributable to all such Shares. 

7. Long-term Consideration for Award. The Participant recognizes and agrees that the Company's key consideration in granting this Award is securing the long-term commitment of the Participant to serve as an officer of the company who will advance and promote the business interests and objectives of the Company and/or its Affiliates (the "Company Group").
