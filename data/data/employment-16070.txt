Executive shall have those powers and duties with respect to the Company normally associated with the position of President and Chief Executive Officer, and such other powers and duties as may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors of the Managing General Partner (hereinafter referred to as “Board”); provided that, the Board shall assign him only such other powers and duties as are of a type, nature and dignity consistent with Executive’s position, and do not violate any applicable laws or regulations. Subject to the remaining provisions hereof, Executive shall devote his full working time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties for the Managing General Partner.

Such right and remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Managing General Partner or the Company at law or in equity in connection with any such breach. Accordingly, Executive consents to the issuance of an injunction, whether preliminary or permanent, consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

(g) Blue Pencil. If, at any time, the provisions of this Section 7 shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area, duration or scope of activity, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and scope of activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter, and Executive and the Managing General Partner agree that this Agreement as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.
