After the meeting with the Board, there shall be no further internal appeals to dispute the Company’s determination of Cause.

6.2 Rights and Remedies upon Breach. 

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that any breach by him of any of the provisions of Section 6.1 or any subparts thereof (individually or collectively the “Restrictive Covenants”) would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages would not provide an adequate remedy. Therefore, if the Executive breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Company and its affiliates, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Company and its affiliates under law or in equity (including, without limitation, the recovery of damages), shall have the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced (without posting bond and without the need to prove damages) by any court having equity jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the right to an entry against the Executive of restraining orders and injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against violations, threatened or actual, and whether or not then continuing, of such Restrictive Covenants. 

(b) The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company’s legitimate business interests and if enforced, will not prevent Executive from obtaining gainful employment should his employment with the Company end.

7.3 Duration and Scope of Covenants. If any court or other decision-maker of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the Executive’s covenants contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such provision, then, after such determination has become final and unappealable, the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. 

7.4 Enforceability; Jurisdiction; Arbitration. 

(a) The Company and the Executive intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants set forth in Section 6 above upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of the Restrictive Covenants.

Any payments under this Agreement that are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”), are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. To this end and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of Executive’s termination of employment with the Company, (i) the Company’s securities are publicly traded on an established securities market; (ii) Executive is a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A); and (iii) the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, then the Company will defer the commencement of such payments (without any reduction in amount ultimately paid or provided to Executive) that are not paid within the short-term deferral rule under Section 409A (and any regulations thereunder) or within the “involuntary separation” exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). Such deferral shall last until the date that is six months following Executive’s termination of employment with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A). Any amounts the payment of which are so deferred shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten days after the end of such deferral period. If Executive dies during the deferral period prior to the payment of any deferred amount, then the unpaid deferred amount shall be paid to the personal representative of Executive’s estate within 60 days after the date of Executive’s death. For purposes of Section 409A, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.
