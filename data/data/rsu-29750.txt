(d) The Recipient shall not be entitled to delivery of the certificate or certificates for any of the Restricted Shares until the Restrictions have lapsed with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4;

(e) The Company will retain custody of all cash dividends and other distributions (“Retained Distributions”) made or declared with respect to the Restricted Shares (and such Retained Distributions will be subject to the Restrictions and the other terms and conditions under this Agreement that are applicable to the Restricted Shares) until such time, if ever, as the Restricted Shares with respect to which such Retained Distributions shall have been made, paid or declared shall have become Vested (as defined below), and such Retained Distributions shall not bear interest or be segregated in separate accounts;

(f) In addition to any terms and conditions of the Plan and the Stockholders Agreement, the Restricted Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by Recipient before the Restrictions have lapsed pursuant to Section 4; and

3.2 Proxy Holder. Notwithstanding Section 3.1, during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date the Restrictions lapse pursuant to Section 4, the Recipient hereby grants to Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (“Carlyle”) or any affiliate of Carlyle (as designated by Carlyle) the Recipient’s proxy, and appoints Carlyle or such affiliate as the Recipient’s attorney in fact (with full power of substitution) (in such capacity, a “Proxy Holder”), to vote or act by written consent with respect to the Restricted Shares in connection with any and all matters as to which any vote or actions may be requested or required. This proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and the Recipient will take further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. The Recipient acknowledges that the Proxy Holder is not acting as a fiduciary for the Recipient and may act in the interests of the Proxy Holder which may be different from those of the Recipient. The Proxy Holder shall not have any liability to the Recipient as a result of any action taken or failure to take action pursuant to the foregoing proxy. The Company hereby acknowledges the receipt of and the validity of the foregoing irrevocable proxy and hereby agrees to recognize the Proxy Holder as the sole attorney and proxy for the Recipient with respect to the Restricted Shares at all times prior to the lapse of the Restrictions pursuant to Section 4.

3.3 Improper disposal. Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Shares in a manner contrary to the Restrictions or any other written agreement to which the Company and the Recipient are parties shall be ineffective and void ab initio. 

ARTICLE 4   
WHEN RESTRICTIONS LAPSE

(c) The first installment shall consist of 33.33% of the Restricted Shares and shall become Vested on the first anniversary of the Grant Date;

(d) The second installment shall consist of 33.33% of the Restricted Shares and shall become Vested on the second anniversary of the Grant Date; and 

(e) The third installment shall consist of 33.33% of the Restricted Shares and shall become Vested on the third anniversary of the Grant Date.

4.3 Discretionary Vesting. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any portion of the Restricted Shares that has not been forfeited pursuant to Section 4.2 and has not otherwise become Vested pursuant to Section 4.1 or Section 4.2.

(e) The Recipient is an “accredited investor,” as that term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

ARTICLE 6   
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Recipient, as of the date hereof, as follows:

6.1 Organization, Good Standing, Corporate Power and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Company is qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect.

6.2 Authority; Binding Effect. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, perform its obligations herein, and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement is a valid, legal and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity. 

6.3 No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will result in any material violation of (a) the charter and by-laws of the Company, and (b) any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation or any applicable order of any court or governmental authority, which violation, conflict or default would have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder.

6.4 The Shares. The Restricted Shares, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms and for the consideration set forth in this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of restrictions on transfer other than (a) restrictions on transfer under applicable state and federal securities laws, (b) the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Stockholders Agreement and (c) liens or encumbrances created by or imposed by the Recipient.

6.5 No Broker Fees. The Company has not employed any investment banker, broker or finder or incurred any actual or potential liability or obligation, whether direct or indirect, for any brokers’ fees or finders’ fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for which the Recipient will be liable.

ARTICLE 7   
TAXATION

7.1 Withholdings. Whenever Restrictions lapse with respect to the Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 4, the Company shall notify the Recipient of the amount of tax, if any, which must be withheld by the Company under all applicable federal, state and local tax laws. The Recipient agrees to make arrangements with the Company to (a) remit a cash payment of the required amount to the Company or (b) authorize the deduction of such amount from the Recipient’s compensation. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the Company shall, upon the Recipient’s request, accept surrender of a whole number of Restricted Shares (or other Shares held by the Recipient) having a Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined pursuant to the Code or other applicable law (the “Tax Date”), not in excess of the minimum of tax required to be withheld by law (or such lower amount as may be necessary to avoid variable award accounting) to cover all or a portion of the applicable withholding taxes (with the remainder paid pursuant to the preceding sentence). Request for such surrender shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the following restrictions: (i) the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date and (ii) once made, the election shall be irrevocable as to the particular Shares for which the election is made. Any adverse consequences to the Recipient arising in connection with the share withholding procedure set forth in this Section 7.1 shall be the sole responsibility of the Recipient.

7.2 83(b) Election. The Recipient has reviewed with his or her own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Recipient is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements of the Company or any of its agents. Except as provided below, the Recipient understands that he or she (and not the Company) shall be responsible for his or her own tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Recipient understands that it may be beneficial in certain circumstances to elect to be taxed as of the Grant Date rather than when the Restrictions lapse by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code (an “83(b) Election”), with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the Grant Date. If the Recipient files an 83(b) Election, the Recipient shall deliver a copy of such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service. THE RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY’S TO TIMELY FILE THE 83(B) ELECTION, EVEN IF HE OR SHE REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.

ARTICLE 8   
MISCELLANEOUS

8.1 The Plan and Stockholders Agreement. Any Restricted Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement shall also be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Stockholders Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Plan or the Stockholders Agreement, the terms of the Plan or the Stockholders Agreement shall control.

8.2 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Administrator or the Board; provided that, except as provided by Section 8.1 of the Plan, neither the amendment, modification, suspension nor termination of this Agreement shall, without the consent of the Recipient, materially impair any rights or obligations under the Restricted Shares.

8.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

8.4 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

8.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law principles of any jurisdiction.

8.6 Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired.

8.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Stockholders Agreement and the Plan, is intended by the parties hereto as a final expression of their agreement and is intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth herein or therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

8.8 Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute such documents and perform such further acts (including, without limitation, obtaining any consents, exemptions, authorizations, or other actions by, or giving any notices to, or making any filings with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person) as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out or to perform the provisions of this Agreement.

8.9 Recipient Representation; Not a Contract of Service. The Recipient hereby represents that the Recipient’s execution of this Agreement and participation in the Plan is voluntary and that the Recipient has in no way been induced to enter into this Agreement in exchange for or as a requirement of the expectation of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Recipient any right to continue as a Service Provider or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge the Recipient at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause except pursuant to an employment or consulting agreement executed by and between the Company and the Recipient and approved by the Board. 

8.10 Conformity to Securities Laws. The Recipient acknowledges that the Plan and this Agreement is intended to conform to the extent necessary with all provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any and all regulations and rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation Rule 16b-3. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan, the Stockholders Agreement and this Agreement shall be administered, and the Restricted Shares are granted, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.

8.11 Data Privacy Consent. As a condition of the Restricted Share grant, the Recipient explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data as described in this paragraph by and among, as applicable, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Recipient’s participation in the Plan. The Recipient understands that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates hold certain personal information about the Recipient, including the Recipient’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all restricted stock or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Recipient’s favor, for the purpose of implementing, managing and administering the Plan (the “Data”). The Recipient further understands that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Recipient’s participation in the Plan, and that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may each further transfer the Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Recipient understands that these recipients may be located in the Recipient’s country, or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Recipient’s country. The Recipient understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. The Recipient authorizes such recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Recipient’s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom the Recipient may elect to deposit any Shares. The Recipient understands that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary or appropriate to implement, administer, and manage the Recipient’s participation in the Plan. The Recipient understands that he or she may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents herein in writing, in any case without cost, by contacting his or her local human resources representative. The Recipient understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect the Recipient’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Recipient understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.
