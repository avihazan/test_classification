2\. Termination of Status as a Director. Prior to a Change in Control this Award Agreement shall be canceled and become automatically null and void immediately after you are no longer a member of the Board of Directors for any reason other than your death, but only to the extent you have not become vested, pursuant to the foregoing terms, on or at the time your membership on the Board of Directors ends.

5\. Issuance and Vesting of Restricted Stock. The Company will hold all Shares of Restricted Stock in escrow, in book entry form, until vesting occurs. You will be reflected as the owner of record on the Company’s books and records of any Shares of Restricted Stock credited to you pursuant to this Award Agreement.

Regardless of whether the offering and sale of Shares under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or have been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company at its discretion may impose restrictions upon the sale, pledge or other transfer of such Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates or the imposition of stop-transfer instructions) if, in the judgment of the Company, such restrictions are necessary or desirable in order to achieve compliance with the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other law or to enforce the intent of this Award Agreement.

Schedule A

“Change in Control” will be deemed to have taken place if: 

(i) any “person” (as such term is used in Section 3(a)(9) and Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) other than the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of it subsidiaries, (x) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of Company securities having more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company that may be cast for the election of directors of the Company (other than as a result of the issuance of securities initiated by the Company in the ordinary course of business) (“Voting Securities”) or (y) becomes the “beneficial owner” of the Company of 25% or more of the Voting Securities of the Company and such person has the power to appoint or elect a majority of the member of the Board; or 

(ii) persons who, as of the effective date of this Award Agreement, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Directors”) cease for any reason, including without limitation, as a result of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or similar transaction, to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a director of the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Award Agreement shall be considered an Incumbent Director if such person’s election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least 50% of the Incumbent Directors; but provided further, that any such person whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of members of the Board or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a “person” (as defined in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Board, including by reason of agreement intended to avoid or settle any such actual or threatened contest or solicitation, shall not be considered an Incumbent Director; or 

(iii) as the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, or any combination of the foregoing transactions, the holders of all the Company’s securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction constitute, following such transaction, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the surviving entity (or in the event each entity survives, the ultimate parent entity resulting from such transaction) (the “Surviving Entity”) entitled to vote generally in the election to elect directors of the Surviving Entity after such transaction.
