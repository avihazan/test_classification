EXHIBIT A 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK OPTION GRANT 

1\. Grant of Option. The Company hereby grants to the Participant named in the Notice of Stock Option Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the “Participant”) an option (the “Option”) to purchase the number of Shares, as set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Exercise Price”), subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 

This Option is not intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 

2\. Vesting Schedule. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, except as provided in Section 3, the Option awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant. Shares scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs. 

3\. Administrator Discretion. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Option at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Option will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. 

4\. Exercise of Option. 

(a) Right to Exercise. If permitted by Applicable Law, this Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement. 

(b) Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable in a manner and pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may determine, which will state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. This Option will be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price. 

5\. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price will be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of Participant. 

(a) cash; 

* * *

(b) check; 

(c) consideration received by the Company under a formal cashless exercise program adopted by the Company in connection with the Plan; or 

(d) surrender of other Shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares, provided that accepting such Shares, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company. 

6\. Tax Obligations. 

(a) Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or Participant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains Participant’s responsibility and that Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option grant, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items. 

Prior to exercise of the Option, Participant will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding and payment obligations of the Company and/or the Employer. In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from his or her wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may, in its discretion, (1) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that Participant acquires to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (2) withhold in Shares, provided that the Company only withholds the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount. Finally, Participant will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of Participant’s participation in the Plan or Participant’s purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. 

(b) Code Section 409A. To the extent Participant is or becomes subject to U.S. Federal income taxation, this subsection (b) shall apply. Under Code Section 409A, an option that vests after December 31, 2004 (or that vested on or prior to such date but which was materially modified after October 3, 2004) that was granted with a per Share exercise price that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) to be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant (a “Discount Option”) or that covers other than “service recipient stock” (as defined under Code Section 409A) may be considered “deferred compensation.” An Option that is a 

-2- 

* * *

Discount Option or that covers other than service recipient stock may result in (i) income recognition by Participant prior to the exercise of the option, (ii) an additional twenty percent (20%) U.S. Federal income tax, and (iii) potential penalty and interest charges. The Option may also result in additional state income, penalty and interest charges to the Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company cannot and has not guaranteed that the IRS will agree that the per Share exercise price of this Option equals or exceeds the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant or that the Shares covered by this Option will be classified as service recipient stock in a later examination. Participant agrees that if the IRS determines that the Option was granted with a per Share exercise price that was less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant or covers other than service recipient stock, Participant will be solely responsible for Participant’s costs related to such a determination. 

7\. Acknowledgements. 

(a) Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan (including any applicable appendixes or sub-plans thereunder) and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts this Option subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof. Participant has reviewed the Plan (including any applicable appendixes or sub-plans thereunder) and this Option Agreement in their entirety has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Option. Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Option Agreement. Participant further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the residence address indicated below. 

(b) The Company (which may or may not be Participant’s Employer) is granting the Option. The Company will administer the Plan from outside Participant’s country of residence, and United States law will govern all Options granted under the Plan. 

(c) Participant acknowledges that benefits and rights provided under the Plan are wholly discretionary and, although provided by the Company, do not constitute regular or periodic payments. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, the benefits and rights provided under the Plan are not to be considered part of Participant’s salary or compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy or other end of service payments, vacation, bonuses, long-term service awards, indemnification, pension or retirement benefits, or any other payments, benefits or rights of any kind. Participant waives any and all rights to compensation or damages as a result of the termination of employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights result or may result from: (i) the loss or diminution in value of such rights under the Plan, or (ii) Participant ceasing to have any rights under, or ceasing to be entitled to any rights under the Plan as a result of such termination. 

(d) The grant of the Option, and any future grant of Options under the Plan is entirely voluntary, and at the complete discretion of the Company. Neither the grant of the Option nor any future grant of an Option by the Company will be deemed to create any obligation to grant any further Options, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant. The Company has the right, at any time to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan. 

-3- 

* * *

(e) The Plan will not be deemed to constitute, and will not be construed by Participant to constitute, part of the terms and conditions of employment, and the Company will not incur any liability of any kind to Participant as a result of any change or amendment, or any cancellation, of the Plan at any time. 

(f) Participation in the Plan will not be deemed to constitute, and will not be deemed by Participant to constitute, an employment or labor relationship of any kind with the Company. 

(g) In the event of termination of Participant’s employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participant’s right to receive the Option and vest in the Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of “garden leave” or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), Participant’s right to exercise the Option after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of Participant’s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; the Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of his or her Option grant. 

8\. Data Privacy. By entering into this Option Agreement, and as a condition of the grant of the Option, Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of his or her personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant’s participation in the Plan. 

Participant understands that the Company and the Employer, its Parent or any Subsidiary may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant’s favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (“Data”). Participant understands that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in Participant’s country or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant’s country. Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Participant’s local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom Participant may elect to deposit any shares of stock acquired upon exercise of the Option. Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant’s participation in the Plan. Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information

about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Participant’s local human resources representative. Participant understands, however, that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect Participant’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative. 

9\. English Language. Participant has received the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement and any other related communications, and Participant consents to having received these documents in English. If Participant has received this Option Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control. 

10\. Rights as Stockholder. Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 

11\. No Guarantee of Continued Service. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THE OPTION OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT’S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT’S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.

The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or U.S. Federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.
