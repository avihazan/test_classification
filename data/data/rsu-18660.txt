The Company desires to provide the Participant with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), as provided in this Agreement in order to carry out the purpose of the Plan. The purpose of this Agreement is to evidence the terms and conditions of a Non-Qualified Stock Option granted to the Participant under the Plan. 

Accordingly, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Participant hereby agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Non-qualified Stock Option. Effective «GrantDt» (the “Effective Date”), the Company granted to the Participant the right and option to purchase all or any part of an aggregate of «Shares» («NbrShares») shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Plan (the “Option”). The Option is not intended to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

2\. Purchase Price. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be «Price» per share. 

3\. Term of the Option. The term of the Option (the “Option Period”) shall be for a period of ten (10) years from the Effective Date, terminating at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Expiration Date”) or such shorter period as provided in Section 6 hereof. 

4\. Vesting of the Option. Subject to Section 6 hereof, the Option may be exercised at any time or from time to time during the Option Period, as to any part or all of the shares covered thereby in accordance with the following vesting schedule: 

(a) twenty five percent (25%) of the Option may be exercised at any time on or after the first anniversary of the Effective Date;

(d) one hundred percent (100%) of the Option may be exercised at any time on or after the fourth anniversary of the Effective Date. 

5\. Transferability. The Option may not be assigned, transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), pledged, hypothecated (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise conveyed or encumbered, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Option contrary to the provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon the Option, shall be void and unenforceable against the Company and shall constitute an immediate cancellation of the Option. 

6. Effect of Termination of Employment.

(a) In the event the Participant shall cease to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate for any reason other than Termination for Cause, Retirement, death or Disability, the Participant may exercise the Option to the extent of (but only to the extent of) the number of vested shares the Participant was entitled to purchase under the Option on the date of such termination of employment, and the exercise of the Option to that limited extent may be effected at any time within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination of employment but not thereafter; provided, however, that the Option may not be exercised after the Expiration Date. 

(b) In the event the Participant shall cease to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate upon Termination for Cause, the Option shall be terminated as of the date of such termination. 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(b) and 6(d), in the event the Participant shall cease to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate because of Retirement, the Option, to the extent not previously exercised or forfeited, shall be exercisable to the extent of (but only to the extent of) the number of vested shares the Participant was entitled to purchase under the Option on the date of the Participant’s Retirement, and the exercise of the Option to that limited extent may be effected at any time within three (3) years after the date of the Participant’s Retirement, but not thereafter; provided, however, that the Option may not be exercised after the Expiration Date. If a Participant who has thus retired dies within three (3) years after the date of the Participant’s Retirement and prior to the Expiration Date, the exercise of the Option to the limited extent provided for in the first sentence of this Section 6(c) may be effected by the Participant’s estate or by any Person or Persons to whom the Option has been transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution at any time within two (2) years after the date of the Participant’s death, but not after the Expiration Date.

In the event of the Participant’s Disability, the exercise of the Option to the limited extent provided for in the first sentence of this Section 6(d) may be effected by the Participant at any time within two (2) years after the date of the Participant’s Disability, but not after the Expiration Date. 

7\. Anti-Dilution Adjustments. In the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the shares of Common Stock covered by the Option such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Agreement, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, in its sole discretion, adjust any or all of the number and type of the shares covered by the Option and the exercise price of the Option.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Option may be exercised by delivering written notice to the Stock Plan Administrator pursuant to procedures prescribed by the Company from time to time. Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Option and the number of shares in respect of which it is being exercised and shall be signed by the Participant or such other Person entitled to exercise the Option. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price of such shares and applicable federal, state, local and foreign withholding taxes, if any.

In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 6(c) or 6(d) hereof by any Person or Persons other than the Participant, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such Person or Persons to exercise the Option. If the Participant fails to pay the full purchase price of such shares or applicable
