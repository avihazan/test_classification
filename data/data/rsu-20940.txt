EXHIBIT 10.1

NAVTEQ CORPORATION

2001 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN



### 1\. Notice of Award.

[Grantee’s Name]

NAVTEQ Corporation (the “Company”) is pleased to advise you that, pursuant to the Company’s 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the Board has granted to you (“you” or “Grantee”) a target award of NUMBER OF RSU’S GRANTED restricted stock units (subject to adjustment below, the “Restricted Units”), effective as of GRANT DATE (the “Date of Grant”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the “Agreement”). Any capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan.

### 2\. Terms and Conditions. This Award is subject to the following terms and conditions:

### a. Performance Period. The period during which corporate performance will be measured for purposes of this Section 2 (the “Performance Period”) will be the 2006 calendar year.

### b. Performance Criteria. The criteria for evaluating the Company’s performance over the Performance Period (the “Performance Criteria”) will be based upon revenue growth and net income goals, as established by the Administrator in greater specificity not later than 90 days following the start of the Performance Period. The Administrator will also at that time establish, in its discretion, a scale to adjust the number of Restricted Units subject hereto based on the achievement of (or failure to achieve) the Performance Criteria.

### c. Determination of Final Award. Following the completion of the Performance Period, the Administrator in its sole discretion will determine the number of Restricted Units that may be earned hereunder (the “Final Award”). Subject to Section 2(d) and 7, each such Restricted Unit represents the right to receive from the Company on the applicable Vesting Date (as defined herein) one share of Common Stock. The Final Award may reflect a downward or upward adjustment to the number of Restricted Units subject to the target award referenced above in Section 1, but will not in any case exceed 250% of that target award. In determining the size of the Final Award, the Administrator will take into account (A) the extent to which the Performance Criteria were, in the Administrator’s sole opinion, achieved, and (B) such other factors as the Administrator may deem relevant, including (but not limited to) required departures from the Company’s operating budget, changes in accounting principles, currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations or other corporate transactions, and other unforeseen events or changes in circumstances since the Date of Grant.

### d. Vesting of Restricted Units.

### (i) Except as provided in Section 2(d)(ii) and Section 3, the Final Award will vest ratably in annual installments at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per year over a four (4) year period beginning on the Date of

### 

###  Grant. The installments will vest on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Date of Grant, respectively, and each such anniversary is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”; provided, however, that in the event you do not maintain your Continuous Status until any given Vesting Date, all of the Restricted Units that have not yet become nonforfeitable shall be forfeited immediately upon the termination of your Continuous Status.

###  If, at any time, you cease to be an Employee of the Company but you continue to provide bona fide services in a different capacity following such cessation, including without limitation as a Director, Consultant or independent contractor, then a termination of your Continuous Status shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Agreement upon such change in relationship. Likewise, your Continuous Status shall not be considered interrupted in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Company or due to a transfer between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Affiliates or any successor.

### (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you commit an act of Misconduct, any Restricted Units which have not prior to the date of such Misconduct become nonforfeitable, or which have become nonforfeitable but have not yet been distributed, will immediately and automatically, without any action on the part of the Company, be forfeited and shall immediately revert to the Plan.

### 3\. Vesting Upon Change in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), the Administrator may take such actions as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, including, without limitation, the acceleration of vesting of Restricted Units, the distribution of shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Units or the substitution of equivalent awards of the surviving or successor entity or a parent thereof.

### 4\. Book Accounts. An unfunded bookkeeping account (the “Account”) shall be established for each Grantee when such person is awarded Restricted Units pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement. Accounts shall be maintained by the Administrator. Restricted Units shall be credited to the Account as of the Date of Grant and debited from the Account to reflect adjustments described in Section 2(c) or Section 11 of the Plan, forfeitures described in Section 2(d) and settlements described in Section 6 or 7. Dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the Shares underlying the Restricted Units shall be credited to the Account in the form of additional Restricted Units (subject to the same terms and conditions as the Restricted Units giving rise to the crediting of such dividends or distributions) based on the Fair Market Value at that time.

### 5\. Rights as Stockholder. You shall not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Units.

### 6\. Delivery of Shares. As soon as practicable following the date Restricted Units credited to your Account become nonforfeitable in accordance with Section 2(d) (the “Delivery Date”), and subject to your satisfaction of any withholding obligations, you shall receive stock certificates (the “Certificates”) evidencing the conversion of those Restricted Units into Shares. The Certificates shall be issued to you as of the Delivery Date and registered in your name.

### 7\. Cash Settlements. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, whenever Shares would otherwise be distributable in respect of Restricted Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may settle all or any portion of those Restricted Units in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares that would otherwise have been distributable.

### 8\. Deferral Election. The Administrator, at such times and in such manner as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, may allow you to defer delivery of the Shares that would otherwise be due by virtue of the satisfaction of the vesting requirements set forth in Section 2(d).

### 9\. Withholding of Taxes. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind (including salary or bonus) otherwise due to you, an amount equal to any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld in connection with the award, deferral or settlement of the Restricted Units or other securities pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall also have the right to withhold Shares otherwise deliverable upon vesting of the Restricted Units to satisfy, in whole or in part, the amount the Company is required to withhold for taxes in connection with this Award (based on the Fair Market Value of such Shares as of the date of such withholding).

### 10\. Conformity with Plan. The Restricted Units are intended to conform in all respects with, and are subject to all applicable provisions of, the Plan (which is incorporated herein by reference). Inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Plan shall be resolved by the Administrator in its discretion. By executing and returning the enclosed copy of this Agreement, you acknowledge your receipt of this Agreement and the Plan and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement and the Plan.

### 11\. NO GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT. GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING SERVICE AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONSULTANT OR DIRECTOR, IN EACH CASE AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED RESTRICTED UNITS OR RECEIVING SHARES HEREUNDER). GRANTEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH GRANTEE’S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE GRANTEE’S SERVICE AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.

### 

### 12\. Amendment or Substitution of Restricted Units. The terms of the Restricted Units may be amended from time to time by the Administrator in its discretion in any manner that it deems appropriate; provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 11 of the Plan or as required to ensure compliance with Applicable Laws, no such amendment shall adversely affect in a material manner any of your rights under the award without your written consent.

### 13\. Unfunded Status of Plan. The Plan is an unfunded arrangement. Any amounts payable in cash under the Plan and this Agreement will be paid from the general assets of the Company. Any person entitled to a payment under the Plan or this Agreement will have the rights of a general creditor of the Company and will not have a claim to any particular asset of the Company.

### 14\. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement.

### 15\. Lock-Up Period. Grantee hereby agrees not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such securities, whether any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, in each case during the seven days prior to

### and the 180 days after the effectiveness of any underwritten offering of the Company’s equity securities (or such longer or shorter period as may be requested in writing by the managing underwriter and agreed to in writing by the Company) (the “Market Standoff Period”), except as part of such underwritten registration if otherwise permitted. In addition, Grantee agrees to execute any further letters, agreements and/or other documents requested by the Company or its underwriters which are consistent with the terms of this Section 15. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to securities subject to the foregoing restrictions until the end of such Market Standoff Period.

### 16\. Restrictions/Legal Compliance. Shares will not be distributed to the Grantee upon vesting of the Restricted Units if the issuance of any Share upon such vesting would constitute a violation of any Applicable Law. The Company may also condition the distribution of Shares upon the execution and delivery of any further documents or instruments by the Grantee deemed necessary or desirable by the Administrator, including any representations and warranties. The Company shall not be required to transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or any other laws or the provisions of this Agreement. Grantee represents that Grantee will be acquiring Shares for Grantee’s own account and not on behalf of others. Grantee understands and acknowledges that federal, state and foreign securities laws govern and restrict Grantee’s right to offer, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares awarded unless such offer, sale or other disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act and state or foreign securities laws, or in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, such offer, sale or other disposition is exempt from registration or qualification thereunder. Grantee agrees that Grantee will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares in any manner which would: (i) require the Company to file any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any similar filing under state law) or to amend or supplement any such filing or (ii) violate or cause the Company to violate the Securities Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any state or other federal law, or (iii) violate any agreement between Grantee and the Company, including this Agreement.

### 17\. Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

### 18\. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Grantee with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

### 19\. Notices. Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given by either the Company or the Grantee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given on the date and at the time delivered via personal, courier or recognized overnight delivery service or, if sent via telecopier, on the date and at the time telecopied with confirmation of delivery or, if mailed, on the date five (5) days after the date of the mailing (which shall be by regular, registered or certified mail). Delivery of a notice by telecopy (with confirmation) shall be permitted and shall be considered delivery of a notice notwithstanding that it is not an original that is received. If directed to the Grantee, any such notice, demand or request shall be sent to the address indicated at the end of this Agreement, or to such other address as the Grantee may hereafter specify in writing. If directed to the Company, any such notice, demand or request shall be sent to the Company’s principal executive office, c/o the Company’s Secretary, or to such other address or person as the Company may hereafter specify in writing.
