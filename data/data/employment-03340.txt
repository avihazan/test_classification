(b) Disability. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event of Executive’s “disability.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, the Executive’s “disability” shall be deemed to have occurred only after one hundred fifty (150) days in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, or after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days, during which one hundred fifty (150) or one hundred twenty (120) days, as the case may be, the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or illness, shall have been unable to substantially discharge his duties under this Employment Agreement. The date of disability shall be such one hundred fiftieth (150th) or one hundred twentieth (120th) day, as the case may be. In the event either the Company or the Executive, after receipt of notice of the Executive’s disability from the other, disputes whether the Executive’s disability shall have occurred, the Executive shall promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major accredited hospital in the Buffalo, New York area and, unless such physician shall issue his written statement to the effect that in his opinion, based on his diagnosis, the Executive is capable of resuming his employment and devoting his full time and energy to discharging his duties within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement, such permanent disability shall be deemed to have occurred. 

(c) Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement for “cause.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, “cause” shall mean 

(i) The Executive’s fraud, commission of a felony, commission of an act or series of acts of dishonesty which are materially inimical to the best interests of the Company, or the Executive’s willful and substantial failure to perform his duties under this Employment Agreement, which failure has not been cured within a reasonable time (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; or  
(ii) The Executive’s material breach of any material provision of this Employment Agreement, which breach, if capable of being cured, has not been cured in all substantial respects within thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive.  
(iii) The Executive’s commission of an act of moral turpitude, dishonesty or fraud which, in the good faith determination of the Board, would render his

continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company.  
  
(d) Termination Without Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement without cause by notifying Executive in writing of its election to terminate at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination. Executive may, on written notice to the Company, accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date of his choosing up to the date of notice of acceleration. 

(e) Termination for Good Reason. Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement for “Good Reason” which shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following events provided that, in the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Executive shall give the Company a written notice, within 90 days following the initial occurrence of the event, describing the event that the Executive claims to be Good Reason and stating the Executive’s intention to terminate employment unless the Company takes appropriate corrective action: 

“Good Reason” shall exist if: 

(i) the Company materially changes the Executive’s duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Employment Agreement or changes his title or position without his consent;  
(ii) there arises a requirement that, in the Executive’s reasonable judgment, the services required to be performed by the Executive would necessitate the Executive moving his residence at least 50 miles from the Buffalo, New York area;  
(iii) the Company materially diminishes the salary, fringe benefits or other compensation being paid to the Executive;  
(iv) there occurs a material breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Employment Agreement;

In the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Company shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the written notice from the Executive stating his claim of Good Reason in which to take appropriate corrective action. If the Company does not cure the Good Reason, the Good Reason will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the 30-day period. 

(f) Termination By Mutual Agreement. This Employment Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and the Executive. 

(g) Resignation. Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time with sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Company, and the Company may accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date up to the date of notice of acceleration. 

(h) Payment of Compensation Due. The Company will pay Executive on the effective date of termination all unpaid compensation accrued at the rate set forth on Exhibit A through the effective date of termination. 

5. Severance Payments  
  
(a) Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. The Company will make the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) or (c) below if this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(d) (Without Cause) or (e) (for Good Reason) hereof. In the event of such termination any outstanding stock options held by Executive shall be deemed to have vested immediately prior to such termination and shall be exercisable at any time during the balance of their original terms. In addition, the employee welfare benefits referred to in Exhibit A, Section 1(c) shall be continued for a period of thirty-six (36) months after termination of employment provided, however, the Executive and not the Company shall pay the premiums for any such benefits, where the payment of the premiums by the Company would constitute gross income to the Executive, during the 6-month period following the Executive’s Separation from Service. 

(b) Severance Payments Without Change in Control. As severance payments under this Section 5(b), the Company will pay Executive thirty-six (36) monthly payments each in an amount equal to 1/12th of the sum of the highest (i) salary payments made by the Company to Executive in any calendar year, (ii) bonus and other incentive compensation earned by Executive (whether or not deferred) with respect to services rendered to the Company during any calendar year and (iii) the value of any restricted stock awards during any calendar year. The 36 monthly payments described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). The first six monthly

Sovran Self Storage, Inc.  
Restated Employment Agreement with David L. Rogers  
Page 6 

payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining thirty monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in 30 separate payments on the first day of 30 successive calendar months with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be excluded from the application of Code Section 409A by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4). 

(c) Severance Payments With Change in Control.

(i) Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making severance payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(b), Executive shall receive the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) (or the remaining balance thereof) in a lump sum. The lump sum shall be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if the Section 409A Change in Control occurs after the Executive’s Separation from Service, within 30 days after such Section 409A Change in Control.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) shall not be paid to the Executive (except for the lump sum equal to six monthly payments provided in the third sentence of Section 5(b)) before the day following the 6- month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service unless Executive shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Executive that payment before that date will not be a violation of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (concerning the 6-month delay rule). In the event that the Executive shall fail to obtain such an opinion of counsel, the Company or its successor shall, within 30 days after the later of the Executive’s Separation from Service or the Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive in a lump sum on the day following the 6-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service.

(ii) Non-Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making severance payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(b), the Company or its successor shall, within 30 days after the Non-Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive from the trust in accordance with the original payment schedule under Section 5(b).  
  
(d) Reimbursement of Legal Fees and Expenses. The Company shall also reimburse the Executive (promptly upon documented request), the amount of all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with any good faith claim for severance compensation hereunder, including all such fees and expenses incurred in contesting or disputing, by arbitration or otherwise, any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Employment Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. 

(e) Gross-up Payments. In the event that the payments or benefits (the “Severance Payments”) provided under this Section 5 are determined to be subject to the tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive additional amounts (the “Gross-Up Payments”) such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Severance Payments and on the Gross-Up Payments and any federal, state and local income and FICA tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payments, shall be equal to the Severance Payments. 

For purposes of determining whether any of the Severance Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) any other payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Transfer of the Company or the termination of the Executive’s employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Employment Agreement

or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Transfer of the Company or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be treated as “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all “excess parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to the Executive such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of the Severance Payments which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the total amount of the Severance Payments or (b) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (i) above), and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Company’s independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. 

In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of the Executive’s employment, the Executive shall repay to the Company at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and FICA taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal, state and local income and FICA tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. 

In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of the termination of the Executive’s employment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional gross-up payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. 

Gross-Up Payments shall be made on the day following the 6-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if later, on the day following the transfer of the Company. 

For the purposes of this Section 5(e), the term “Transfer of the Company” means a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the

ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i). 

(f) No Obligation To Mitigate Damages. Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages with respect to termination and in the event Executive is employed or receives income from any other source there shall be no offset therefor against the amounts due from the Company hereunder. 

6. Covenants and Confidential Information.  
  
(a) The Executive acknowledges the Company’s reliance and expectation of the Executive’s continued commitment to performance of his duties and responsibilities during the term of this Employment Agreement. In light of such reliance and expectation on the part of the Company: 

(i) During the term of this Employment Agreement and, during the one-year period following the termination of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall not: (A) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm, association or other business entity engaged in the business of, or otherwise engage in the business of, acquiring, owning, developing or managing self-storage facilities; provided, however, that the ownership of not more than one percent (1%) of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity is permitted ; or (B) directly or indirectly or by acting in concert with others, employ or attempt to employ or solicit for any employment competitive with the Company, any Company employees.  
(ii) During and after the term of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, divulge, discuss, copy or otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner, in competition with, or contrary to the interests of, the Company, any confidential information relating to the Company’s operations, properties or otherwise to its

particular business or other trade secrets of the Company, it being acknowledged by the Executive that all such information regarding the business of the Company compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, the Executive while the Executive shall have been employed by or associated with the Company is confidential information and the Company’s exclusive property; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to the extent that such information (A) is clearly obtainable in the public domain, (B) becomes obtainable in the public domain, except by reason of the breach by the Executive of the terms hereof, (C) was not acquired by the Executive in connection with his employment or affiliation with the Company, (D) was not acquired by the Executive from the Company or its representatives, or (E) is required to be disclosed by rule or law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency.  
  
(b) The Executive agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by him of this Paragraph 6 will be inadequate and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon adequate proof of the Executive’s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Paragraph 6, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. 

(c) The Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon him and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Company under this Paragraph 6, and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition which otherwise would be unfair to the Company, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of the Executive, would not operate as a bar to the Executive’s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and do not confer a benefit upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment to the Executive.

The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be deemed to possess the powers to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with such arbitration; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7(d) shall be construed so as to deny the Company the right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of his covenants contained in Section 6 hereof. 

(e) Any notice to be given under this Employment Agreement shall be personally delivered in writing or shall have been deemed duly given when received after it is posted in the United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified, return receipt requested, and if mailed to the Company, shall be addressed to the principal place of business of the Corporation and the Partnership, attention: President, and if mailed to the Executive, shall be addressed to him at his home address last known on the records of the Company, or at such other address or addresses as either the Company or the Executive may hereafter designate in writing to the other. 

(f) The failure of either party to enforce any provision or provisions of this Employment Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Employment Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the

EXHIBIT A

1. Compensation.  
  
During the term of the Employment Agreement the Company shall pay or provide, as the case may be, to the Executive the compensation and other benefits and rights set forth in this Paragraph 1 of this Exhibit A. 

(a) The Company shall pay to the Executive a base salary payable in accordance with the Company’s usual pay practices (and in the event no less frequently than monthly) of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) per annum, subject to such increase (but not decrease) as may be determined by the Board from time to time, based upon the performance of the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Executive. 

(b) The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company’s incentive compensation plans for senior executives. The Company shall pay to the Executive incentive compensation, if any, which such Executive is entitled to receive pursuant to such plan for each calendar year not later than March 15 following the end of such calendar year (or at such time as may be provided in such plan), prorated on a per diem basis for partial calendar years of service.

payments described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). The first six monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining eighteen monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in 18 separate payments on the first day of 18 successive calendar months with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be excluded from the application of Code Section 409A by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4). 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraphs 1(d) and 2(a), in the event of the Executive’s death or disability the Executive’s employment hereunder shall terminate and the Executive shall be entitled to no further compensation or other benefits under the Employment Agreement, except as to that portion of any unpaid salary and other benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and including the date of such death or permanent disability, as the case may be.
