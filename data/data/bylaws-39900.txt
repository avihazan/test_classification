SECTION 6. Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors shall fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the day before the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment.

  


SECTION 7. Voting Lists. At least 10 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to such meeting. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book shall be prima facie evidence of the shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Failure to comply with the requirements of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.

  


SECTION 8. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present or represented at a meeting, a majority of those present or represented may transact any business which comes before the meeting, unless a greater percentage is required by law. If less than a quorum of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified, and in the case of any adjourned meeting called for the election of directors, those who attend the second of the adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.

  


SECTION 9. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. All proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the commencement of meetings. No proxy may be effectively revoked until notice in writing of such revocation has been given to the secretary of the corporation by the shareholder (or his duly authorized attorney in fact, as the case may be) granting the proxy. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution unless it is coupled with an interest.

  


SECTION 10. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. A certified copy of a resolution adopted by such directors shall be conclusive as to their action.

Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by heither in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name.

  


Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed.

  


If shares are held jointly by three or more fiduciaries, the will of the majority of the fiduciaries shall control the manner of voting or giving of a proxy, unless the instrument or order appointing such fiduciaries otherwise directs.

  


A shareholder, whose shares are pledged, shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter, the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

  


Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the corporation, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation held by the corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.

  


SECTION 11. Voting. Every holder of outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at any meeting shall be entitled to the number of votes (if any) as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation. Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, by statute, or by these bylaws, a majority of those votes cast by shareholders at a lawful meeting shall be sufficient to pass on a transaction or matter.

  


SECTION 12. Informal Action by Shareholders. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be given by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.

Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing filed with the secretary. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

In the absence of fraud, the fact that any director, officer, employee, shareholder, or any corporation, association, firm or other entity of which any director, officer, employee or shareholder is interested, is in any way interested in any transaction or contract shall not make the transaction or contract void or voidable, or require the director, officer, employee or shareholder to account to this corporation for any profits therefrom if the transaction or contract is or shall be authorized, ratified, or approved by (i) the vote of a majority of the Board of Directors excluding any interested director or directors, (ii) the written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or (iii) a general resolution approving the acts of the directors and officers adopted at a shareholders meeting by vote of the holders of the majority of the shares entitled to vote.
