e.

Revenue and Net Income Exclusions Defined. For the purposes of Section 3d above, to the extent the Company acquires any companies or businesses during any given fiscal year and the financial impact of such acquisition was not previously factored into the annual operating budget approved by the Board of Directors, the following revenue and net income adjustments shall be made to the Company’s fiscal results in measuring whether or not the Company has met or exceeded the specific performance targets outlined in Sections 3d.  
  
  


1.) “Revenue Exclusions” shall be defined as the pro rated annualized quarterly GAAP revenue of any company or business acquired by the Company for the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date such company or business is acquired by the Company. Such annualized quarterly revenue shall be prorated by multiplying the total annualized quarterly revenue described above by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of the financial results of the acquired business or company that are included in the Company’s financial results during the fiscal year in question, and the denominator of which is 365.

2.) “Net Income Exclusions” shall be defined as the pro rated annualized quarterly GAAP net income of any company or business acquired by the Company for the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date such company or business is acquired by the Company. Such annualized quarterly net income shall be prorated by multiplying the total annualized quarterly net income described above by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of the financial results of the acquired business or company that are included in the Company’s financial results during the fiscal year in question, and the denominator of which is 365. Net income exclusions shall also include a) any non-cash stock compensation expenses over and above what was included in any budget, and b) any extraordinary or non-recurring expenses that were not included in the budget for any given year and in the reasonable judgment of the Compensation Committee could not have been foreseen by Management during the process to set the budget for such year.  
  
  


f.

Paid Time-Off and Holidays. Employee’s paid time-off (“PTO”) and holidays shall be consistent with the standards set forth in the Employee Handbook, as revised from time to time or as otherwise published by the Company. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Employee will be eligible for four (4) weeks of paid time off (PTO)/year (160 hours), which will accrue on a pro-rata basis throughout the year, provided, however, that it is the Company’s policy that no more than forty (40) hours of paid time-off can be accrued and carried forward for any given employee as of the anniversary of their employment date in any given year. Thus, when accrued PTO reaches two hundred (200) hours, Employee will cease accruing PTO until accrued PTO is one hundred sixty (160) hours or less - at which point Employee will again accrue PTO until he reaches two hundred (200) hours. In addition to paid time off, there are also six (6) paid national holidays and two (2) “floater” days available to Company employees. Employee agrees to schedule such paid time-off so that it minimally interferes with the Company’s operations. Such PTO does not include Board of Directors excused absences.  
  
  


g.

Reimbursement of Normal Business Expenses. The Company will reimburse all normal business expenses of the Employee not covered by the above paragraphs, including, but not limited to, cell phone expenses and business related travel, meals and entertainment expenses in accordance with the Company’s polices for such reimbursement.  
  
  


4. Best Efforts of the Employee and Place of Employment. Employee agrees to perform all of the duties pursuant to the express and implicit terms of this contract to the reasonable satisfaction of Employer. Employee further agrees to perform such duties faithfully and to the best of his ability, talent, and experience, and devote his full-working time and attention on Employer's business (at least forty (40) hours per week). Employee shall render such duties at the Employer’s primary place of business in Fort Myers, FL or such other place or places as the interest, needs, business, or opportunity of Employer shall require. 

5. Termination. The parties agree that any termination of the Employee under this Agreement will be governed as follows:

  


a.

By the Company for Cause. The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to discharge the Employee for Cause (as defined below), at any time during the Employment Period. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have “Cause” to terminate the Employee’s employment hereunder upon:  
  
06/24/08

* * *

  


(i) failure to materially perform and discharge the duties and responsibilities of Employee under this Agreement after receiving written notice and allowing Employee ten (10) business days to create a plan to cure such failure(s), such plan being acceptable to the Board of Directors, and a further thirty (30) days to cure such failure(s), if so curable, provided, however, that after one such notice has been given to Employee and the thirty (30) day cure period has lapsed, the Company is no longer required to provide time to cure subsequent failures under this provision, or 

  


(ii)  any breach by Employee of the material provisions of this Agreement; or 

  


(iii)  misconduct which, in the good faith opinion and sole discretion of the Board of Directors, is injurious to the Company; or 

  


(iv)  felony conviction involving the personal dishonesty or moral turpitude of Employee; or a determination by the Board, after consideration of all available information, that Employee has willfully and knowingly violated Company policies or procedures involving discrimination, harassment, or work place violence; or 

  


(v)  engagement in illegal drug use or alcohol abuse which prevents Employee from performing his duties in any manner, or 

  


(vi)  any misappropriation, embezzlement or conversion of the Company’s opportunities or property by the Employee; or 

  


(vii)  willful misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence by the Employee in respect of the duties or obligations of the Employee under this Agreement and/or the Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation or Non-Competition Agreement.

  


Any termination for Cause pursuant to this Section shall be given to the Employee in writing and shall set forth in detail all acts or omissions upon which the Company is relying to terminate the Employee for Cause. If an Employee is terminated for Cause, the Employee shall only be entitled to receive his accrued and unpaid Salary, bonus and other benefits through the termination date and the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement from and after the date of termination.

  


b.

Termination by Company Without Cause. At any time during the Employment Period, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to discharge the Employee without Cause effective upon delivery of written notice to the Employee. If the Company terminates the Employee without “Cause” for any reason, then the Company agrees that as severance it will continue to pay the Executive’s Base Salary in accordance with Section 3a. and maintain the Executive’s employee benefits in accordance with Section 3c. (the “Severance Payments”) for six (6) months from the notice of termination. Employee further agrees that in the event that he obtains employment during any period where Severance Payments are being made, he will promptly notify the Company. Provided that such employment does not violate the terms of the Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement, such severance payments will continue to be paid. If a termination of the Employee by the Company Without Cause shall occur at anytime, than the pro rata portion of any unvested Time-based options (as specified in Section 3d(1)) up until the date of the Employee’s termination that were due to vest in the year of the Employee’s termination shall vest. Other than as set forth in the immediately preceding three sentences, the Company shall have no further salary or bonus payment or other benefits obligations under this Agreement after the date of termination; provided, however, that the Employee shall only be entitled to continuation of the Severance Payments as long as he is in compliance with the provisions of the Confidentiality, Non-Compete and Non-Solicit Agreement, which is part of this Agreement.

The Employee acknowledges and agrees that any and all payments to which he would be entitled under this Paragraph 5b are conditioned upon and subject to his execution of a general waiver and release, in such reasonable form as counsel for the Company shall determine, of all claims the Employee has or may have against the Company.

  


c.

By Resignation of the Employee. The Employee may terminate his employment hereunder, upon giving sixty (60) days written notice to the Company. The Employee agrees that during such sixty (60) day period no more than one week of unused vacation may be utilized and that all other unused vacation up to the time of termination shall be forfeited. In the event of such a termination, the Employee shall comply with any reasonable request of the Company to assist in providing for an orderly transition of authority, but such assistance shall not delay the Employee’s termination of employment longer than sixty (60) days beyond the Employee’s original notice of termination. Upon such a termination, the Employee shall become entitled to any accrued but unpaid salary and other benefits up to and including the date of termination.   
  
.

d.

Disability of the Employee. This Agreement may be terminated by the Company upon the Disability of the Employee. "Disability" shall mean any mental or physical illness, condition, disability or incapacity which prevents the Employee from reasonably discharging his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) days in any one hundred eighty (180) day period. In the event that any disagreement or dispute shall arise between the Company and the Employee as to whether the Employee suffers from any Disability, then, in such event, the Employee shall submit to the physical or mental examination of a physician licensed under the laws of the State of Florida, who is agreeable to the Company and the Employee, and such physician shall determine whether the Employee suffers from any Disability. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the determination of such physician shall be final and binding upon the Company and the Employee. The entire cost of such examination shall be paid solely by the Company. In the event the Company has purchased disability insurance for Employee, the Employee shall be deemed disabled if he is disabled as defined by the terms of the disability policy. On the date that the Employee is deemed to have a Disability, this Agreement will be deemed to have been terminated and the Employee shall be entitled to receive from the Company his accrued and unpaid Base Salary, bonus and other benefits through the termination date. If a termination of the Employee by Disability shall occur at anytime, than the pro rata portion of any unvested Time-based options (as specified in Section 3d(1)) up until the date of the Employee’s termination that were due to vest in the year of the Employee’s termination shall vest. Other than as set forth in the immediately preceding two sentences, the Company shall have no further salary or bonus payment or other benefits obligations under this Agreement from and after the date of termination due to Disability.

e.

Death of the Employee. In the event of the death of Employee, the employment of the Employee by the Company shall automatically terminate on the date of the Employee's death and the Company shall be obligated to pay Employee’s estate (i) the Employee’s accrued and unpaid Base Salary, bonus and other benefits through the termination date. If the death of the Employee shall occur at anytime, than the pro rata portion of any unvested Time-based options up until the date of the Employee’s death that were due to vest in the year of the Employee’s death shall vest. Other than as set forth in the immediately preceding two sentences, the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement from and after the date of termination due to the death of the Employee.   
  
6. Confidentiality, Non-Compete & Non-Solicitation Agreement.

7. Importance of Certain Clauses. Employee and Employer state that the covenants contained in the Confidentiality, Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement attached hereto and incorporated into this Agreement are material terms of this Agreement and all parties understand the importance of such provisions to the ongoing business of Employer. As such, because Employer's continued business and viability depend on the protection of such secrets and non-competition, these clauses are interpreted by the parties to have the widest and most expansive applicability as may be allowed by law and Employee understands and acknowledges his or her understanding of same.

  


8. Consideration. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the provision of employment under this Agreement and the execution by the Employer of this Agreement constitute full, adequate and sufficient consideration to Employee for the Employee's duties, obligations and covenants under this Agreement and under the Confidentiality, Non-Competition & Non-Solicit Agreement incorporated into this Agreement.

  


9. Exit Interview. Upon the effective date of termination of employment (unless due to Employee’s death), the Employee shall participate in an exit interview with Employer and certify in writing that the Employee has complied with his contractual obligations and intends to comply with his continuing obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the terms of the Confidentiality, Non-Compete and Non-Solicit Agreement. The Employee shall also provide the Employer with information concerning the Employee's subsequent employer and the capacity in which the Employee will be employed. The Employee's failure to comply shall be a material breach of this Agreement, for which the Employer, in addition to any other civil remedy, may seek equitable relief.

  


10. Withholding. All payments made to the Employee shall be made net of any applicable withholding for income taxes and the Employee's share of FICA, FUTA or other taxes. The Company shall withhold such amounts from such payments to the extent required by applicable law and remit such amounts to the applicable governmental authorities in accordance with applicable law. 

11\.  Representations of Employee. Employee represents and warrants to the Company that (a) nothing in his past legal and/or work and/or personal experiences, which if became broadly known in the marketplace, would impair his ability to serve as the Principle Accounting Officer of a publicly-traded company or materially damage his credibility with public shareholders; (b) that there are no restrictions, agreements, or understandings whatsoever to which he is a party which would prevent or make unlawful his execution of this Agreement or employment hereunder, (c) that Employee’s execution of this Agreement and employment hereunder shall not constitute a breach of any contract, agreement or understanding, oral or written, to which he is a party or by which he is bound, (d) that Employee is free and able to execute this Agreement and to continue employment with the Company, and (e) that Employee has not used and will not use confidential information or trade secrets belonging to any prior employers to perform services for Company.
