WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of, and in partial consideration for the Investor entering into, the Purchase Agreement, the Company has issued to the Investor a warrant, exercisable from time to time, in accordance with its terms, within five (5) years following the six-month anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Warrant”) for the purchase of an aggregate of up to 421,918 shares of Common Stock at a price specified in such Warrant; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of, and in partial consideration for, the Investor’s agreement to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide the Investor with certain registration rights with respect to the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) as set forth herein.

ARTICLE I

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 1.1. Registration Statement. 

(a) Filing of the Registration Statement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall file with the Commission within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act or such other form as deemed appropriate by counsel to the Company for the registration for the resale by the Investor of the Registrable Securities (the “Registration Statement”). 

(b) Effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Closing Date and (ii) to ensure that the Registration Statement remains in effect throughout the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 4.2, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

(c) Regulatory Disapproval. The contemplated effective date for the Registration Statement as described in Section 1.1(b) shall be extended without default or liquidated damages hereunder or under the Purchase Agreement in the event that the Company’s failure to obtain the effectiveness of the 

* * *

##### 

Registration Statement on a timely basis results from (i) the failure of the Investor to timely provide the Company with information requested by the Company and necessary to complete the Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act, or (ii) the Commission’s disapproval of the structure of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, or (iii) events or circumstances that are not in any way attributable to the Company. In the event of clause (ii) above, the parties agree to cooperate with one another in good faith to arrive at a resolution acceptable to the Commission. 

(d) Failure to Maintain Effectiveness of Registration Statement. In the event the Company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (or the Prospectus) throughout the period set forth in Section 4.2, other than temporary suspensions as set forth in Section 1.1(e), and the Investor holds any Registrable Securities at any time during the period of such ineffectiveness (an “Ineffective Period”), the Company shall pay to the Investor in immediately available funds into an account designated by the Investor an amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of Registrable Securities issued to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Warrant Shares) and owned by the Investor at any time during such Ineffective Period and (y) the result, if greater than zero, obtained by subtracting the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately following the last day of such Ineffective Period from the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the day on which any such Ineffective Period began; provided, however, (i) that the foregoing payments shall not apply in respect of Registrable Securities that are otherwise freely tradable by the Investor or if the Company offers to repurchase from the Investor such Registrable Securities for a per share purchase price equal to the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the day on which any such Ineffective Period began and (ii) that the Company shall be under no obligation to supplement the Prospectus to reflect the issuance of any Shares pursuant to a Draw Down at any time prior to the day following the Settlement Date with respect to such Shares and that the failure to supplement the Prospectus prior to such time period shall not be deemed a failure to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (or Prospectus) for purposes of this Agreement (including this Section 1.1(d)). 

(e) Deferral or Suspension During a Blackout Period. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.1(d), if in the good faith judgment of the Company, following consultation with legal counsel, it would be detrimental to the Company or its stockholders for the Registration Statement to be filed or for resales of Registrable Securities to be made pursuant to the Registration Statement due to (i) the existence of a material development or potential material development involving the Company that the Company would be obligated to disclose or incorporate by reference in the Registration Statement, which disclosure would be premature or otherwise inadvisable at such time or would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or its stockholders, or (ii) a filing of a Company-initiated registration of any class of its equity securities, which, in the good faith judgment of the Company, because such filing of the Registration Statement or continued resale would adversely affect or require premature disclosure of the filing of such Company-initiated registration (notice thereof, a “Blackout Notice”), the Company shall have the right to (A) immediately defer such filing for a period of not more than sixty (60) days beyond the date by which such Registration Statement was otherwise required hereunder to be filed or (B) suspend use of such Registration Statement for a period of not more than thirty (30) days (any such deferral or suspension period, a “Blackout Period”). The Investor acknowledges that it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such Registration Statement to be filed (or remain in effect) during a Blackout Period and therefore essential to defer such filing (or suspend the use thereof) during such Blackout Period and agrees to cease any disposition of the Registrable Securities during such Blackout Period. The Company may not utilize any of its rights under this Section 1.1(e) to defer the filing of a Registration Statement (or suspend its effectiveness) more than six (6) times in any twelve (12) month period. In the event that, within thirty (30) calendar days following any Settlement Date, the Company gives a Blackout Notice to the Investor and the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding such Blackout Period (“Old VWAP”) is greater than the VWAP on the first Trading Day following such 

2

* * *

##### 

Blackout Period that the Investor may sell its Registrable Securities pursuant to an effective Registration Statement (“New VWAP”), then the Company shall pay to the Investor, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Investor, the Blackout Amount (as hereinafter defined). For purposes of this Agreement, “Blackout Amount” means the lesser of (x) the product of (i) the total number of Registrable Securities issued to the Investor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and owned by the Investor immediately prior to the Blackout Period and (ii) the result obtained by subtracting the New VWAP from the Old VWAP, (y) 90% of the most recent Draw Down Amount and (z) 80% of the Maximum Draw Down Amount; provided, however, that no Blackout Amount shall be payable in respect of Registrable Securities (A) that are otherwise freely tradable by the Investor, including under Rule 144, during the Blackout Period, or (B) if the Company offers to repurchase from the Investor such Registrable Securities for a per share purchase price equal to the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the day on which any such Blackout Period began. For any Blackout Period in respect of which a Blackout Amount becomes due and payable, rather than paying the Blackout Amount, the Company may at is sole discretion, issue to the Investor shares of Common Stock with an aggregate market value determined as of the first Trading Day following such Blackout Period equal to the Blackout Amount (“Blackout Shares”). 

(f) Liquidated Damages. The Company and the Investor hereto acknowledge and agree that the amounts payable under Sections 1.1(d) and 1.1(e) and the Blackout Shares deliverable under Section 1.1(e) above (i) shall constitute the Investor’s sole remedy with respect to the Company’s failure to maintain the effectiveness, or for any deferral or suspension, of the Registration Statement, and (ii) shall constitute liquidated damages and not penalties. The parties further acknowledge that (i) the amount of loss or damages likely to be incurred by the Investor is incapable or is difficult to precisely estimate, (ii) the amounts specified in such subsections bear a reasonable proportion and are not plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss likely to be incurred in connection with any failure by the Company to obtain or maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (iii) one of the reasons for the Company and the Investor reaching an agreement as to such amounts was the uncertainty and cost of litigation regarding the question of actual damages, and (iv) the Company and the Investor are sophisticated business parties and have been represented by sophisticated and able legal and financial counsel and negotiated this Agreement at arm’s length. The Investor further agrees that, if the Company makes the payments provided for in Section 1.1(e), the Company’s deferral or suspension of the Registration Statement pursuant to Section 1.1(e) shall not constitute a material breach or default of any obligation of the Company to the Investor. 

(g) Additional Registration Statements. In the event and to the extent that the Registration Statement fails to register a sufficient amount of Common Stock necessary for the Company to issue and sell to the Investor and the Investor to purchase from the Company all of the Registrable Securities to be issued, sold and purchased under the Purchase Agreement and the Warrant, the Company shall, upon a timetable mutually agreeable to both the Company and the Investor, prepare and file with the Commission an additional registration statement or statements in order to effectuate the purpose of this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the Warrant.

(b) Three (3) Trading Days prior to filing the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto (excluding amendments deemed to result from the filing of documents incorporated by reference therein, supplements to the Prospectus required in respect of any particular Settlement Date, and supplements to the Registration Statement for which consent of or notice to the Investor is not required pursuant to Section 6.12 of the Purchase Agreement), the Company shall deliver to the Investor and to counsel representing the Investor, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 4.8, copies of the Registration Statement, Prospectus and/or any amendments or supplements thereto as proposed to be filed, together with exhibits thereto, which documents will be subject to review by the Investor and such counsel, and thereafter deliver to the Investor and such counsel, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 4.8, such number of copies of the Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto), the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents or information as the Investor or counsel may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities, provided, however, that to the extent reasonably practicable, such delivery may be accomplished via electronic means.

Records disclosed hereunder that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and that it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors unless the disclosure or release of such Records is requested or required pursuant to oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents or a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction or other judicial or governmental process; provided, however, that prior to any disclosure or release pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, the Inspectors shall provide the Company with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or waive such Inspectors’ obligation not to disclose such Records; and, provided, further, that if failing the entry of a protective order or the waiver by the Company permitting the disclosure or release of such Records, the Inspectors, upon advice of counsel, are compelled to disclose such Records, the Inspectors may disclose that portion of the Records that counsel has advised the Inspectors that the Inspectors are compelled to disclose; provided, however, that upon any such required disclosure, such Inspector shall use his or her best efforts to obtain reasonable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded such information. The Investor agrees that information obtained by it solely as a result of such inspections (not including any information obtained from a third party who, insofar as is known to the Investor after reasonable inquiry, is not prohibited from providing such information by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company) shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used for any purposes other than as indicated above or by it as the basis for any market transactions in the securities of the Company or its affiliates unless and until such information is made generally available to the public. The Investor further agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential. 

(f) The Company shall otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including, without limitation, compliance with applicable reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.
