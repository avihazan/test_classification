SUNVAULT ENERGY, INC.

2014 Stock Option Plan



This STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), dated as of the ____________ day of ______________, 201___ is made by and between Sunvault Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Corporation"), and ____________________________ (the "Optionee," which term as used herein shall be deemed to include any successor to the Optionee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, unless the context shall otherwise require).

BACKGROUND

Pursuant to the Corporation’s 2014 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), the Corporation, acting through the Committee of the Board of Directors (if a committee has been formed to administer the Plan) or its entire Board of Directors (if no such committee has been formed) responsible for administering the Plan (in either case, referred to herein as the "Committee"), approved the issuance to the Optionee, _________________ share options at $_________ per share, effective as of the date set forth above, of a stock option to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Corporation at the price (the "Option Price") set forth in the attached Notice of Grant (which is expressly incorporated herein and made a part hereof, the "Notice of Grant"), upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and undertakings hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Option; Option Price. On behalf of the Corporation, the Committee hereby grants to the Optionee the option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan (which is incorporated by reference herein and which in all cases shall control in the event of any conflict with the terms, definitions and provisions of this Agreement), that number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation set forth in the Notice of Grant, at an exercise price per share equal to the Option Price as is set forth in the Notice of Grant (the "Optioned Shares"). If designated in the Notice of Grant as an "incentive stock option," the Option is intended to qualify for Federal income tax purposes as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. A copy of the Plan as in effect on the date hereof has been supplied to the Optionee, and the Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt thereof.

2. Term. The term (the "Option Term") of the Option shall commence on the date of this Agreement and shall expire on the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice of Grant unless such Option shall theretofore have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant, this Agreement or of the Plan.

2

* * *

3. Time of Exercise.

(a) Unless accelerated in the discretion of the Committee or as otherwise provided herein, the Option shall become exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant. Subject to the provisions of Sections 5 and 8 hereof, shares as to which the Option becomes exercisable pursuant to the foregoing provisions may be purchased at any time thereafter prior to the expiration or termination of the Option.

(b) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, the Option shall not be exercisable as an Incentive Stock Option, and shall be treated as a Non-Statutory Option, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date hereof of all stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Corporation, its parent and its subsidiaries, if any) exceeds $100,000.

4. Termination of Option.

(a) The Optionee may exercise the Option (but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of termination of the Optionee’s Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries) at any time within three (3) months following the termination of the Optionee’s Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, but not later than the scheduled expiration date. If the termination of the Optionee’s employment is for cause or is otherwise attributable to a breach by the Optionee of an employment, non-competition, non-disclosure or other material agreement, the Option shall expire immediately upon such termination. If the Optionee is a natural person who dies while in a Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, this option may be exercised, to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which the Optionee could have exercised it on the date of his death, by his estate, personal representative or beneficiary to whom this option has been assigned pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan, at any time within the twelve (12) month period following the date of death. If the Optionee is a natural person whose Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries is terminated by reason of his disability, this Option may be exercised, to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which the Optionee could have exercised it on the date the Business Relationship was terminated, at any time within the twelve (12) month period following the date of such termination, but not later than the scheduled expiration date. At the expiration of such three (3) or twelve (12) month period or the scheduled expiration date, whichever is the earlier, this Option shall terminate and the only rights hereunder shall be those as to which the Option was properly exercised before such termination.

(b) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Option shall not be affected by any change of duties or position of the Optionee (including a transfer to or from the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries) so long as the Optionee continues in a Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries.

* * *

5. Procedure for Exercise.

(a) The Option may be exercised, from time to time, in whole or in part (but for the purchase of whole shares only), by delivery of a written notice in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Notice") from the Optionee to the Secretary of the Corporation, which Notice shall:

(i) state that the Optionee elects to exercise the Option;

(ii) state the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised (the "Optioned Shares");

(iii) state the method of payment for the Optioned Shares pursuant to Section 5(b);

(iv) state the date upon which the Optionee desires to consummate the purchase of the Optioned Shares (which date must be prior to the termination of such Option and no later than 30 days from the delivery of such Notice);

(v) include any representations of the Optionee required under Section 8(b);

(vi) if the Option shall be exercised in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan by any person other than the Optionee, include evidence to the satisfaction of the Committee of the right of such person to exercise the Option; and

(b) Payment of the Option Price for the Optioned Shares shall be made either (i) by delivery of cash or a check to the order of the Corporation in an amount equal to the Option Price, (ii) if approved by the Committee, by delivery to the Corporation of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal in amount to the Option Price of the options being exercised, (iii) by any other means which the Board of Directors determines are consistent with the purpose of the Plan and with applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of Rule 16b-3 and Regulation T promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board), or (iv) by any combination of such methods of payment.

(c) The Corporation shall issue a stock certificate in the name of the Optionee (or such other person exercising the Option in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the Plan) for the Optioned Shares as soon as practicable after receipt of the Notice and payment of the aggregate Option Price for such shares.

6. No Rights as a Stockholder. The Optionee shall not have any privileges of a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to any Optioned Shares until the date of issuance of a stock certificate pursuant to Section 5(c).

7. Adjustments. The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of options in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to stock subject to options and the related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Corporation are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference. In general, the Optionee should not assume that options would survive the acquisition of the Corporation.

8. Additional Provisions Related to Exercise.

(a) The Option shall be exercisable only on such date or dates and during such period and for such number of shares of Common Stock as are set forth in this Agreement.

(b) To exercise the Option, the Optionee shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 5 hereof. Upon the exercise of the Option at a time when there is not in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Option, the Committee in its discretion may, as a condition to the exercise of the Option, require the Optionee (i) to execute an Investment Representation Statement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto and (ii) to make such other representations and warranties as are deemed appropriate by counsel to the Corporation.

(c) Stock certificates representing shares of Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of Options that have not been registered under the Securities Act shall, if required by the Committee, bear an appropriate restrictive legend referring to the Securities Act. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered upon the exercise of the Option unless and until the Corporation and/or the Optionee shall have complied with all applicable Federal or state registration, listing and/or qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction.

9. No Evidence of Employment or Service. Nothing contained in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue in a Business Relationship with the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation, its parent or its subsidiaries (subject to the terms of any separate agreement to the contrary) to terminate the Optionee’s Business Relationship or to increase or decrease the Optionee’s compensation at any time.

10. Restriction on Transfer. The Option may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Optionee, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee. If the Optionee dies, the Option shall thereafter be exercisable, during the period specified in Section 4, by his executors or administrators to the full extent to which the Option was exercisable by the Optionee at the time of his death. The Option shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Option contrary to the provisions hereof, and the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon the Option, shall be null and void and without effect. The words "transfer" and "dispose" include without limitation the making of any sale, exchange, assignment, gift, security interest, pledge or other encumbrance, or any contract therefor, any voting trust or other agreement or arrangement with respect to the transfer of any interest, beneficial or otherwise, in the Option, the creation of any other claim thereto or any other transfer or disposition whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, affecting the right, title, interest or possession with respect to the Option.

11. Specific Performance. Optionee expressly agrees that the Corporation will be irreparably damaged if the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan are not specifically enforced. Upon a breach or threatened breach of the terms, covenants and/or conditions of this Agreement or the Plan by the Optionee, the Corporation shall, in addition to all other remedies, be entitled to a temporary or permanent injunction, without showing any actual damage, and/or decree for specific performance, in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof. The Board of Directors shall have the power to determine what constitutes a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or the Plan. Any such determinations shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the Optionee.

12. Disqualifying Dispositions. To the extent the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, and if the Optioned Shares are disposed of within two years following the date of this Agreement or one year following the issuance thereof to the Optionee (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the Optionee shall, immediately prior to such Disqualifying Disposition, notify the Corporation in writing of the date and terms of such Disqualifying Disposition and provide such other information regarding the Disqualifying Disposition as the Corporation may reasonably require.

13. Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if (i) personally delivered or sent by telecopy, (ii) sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or (iii) sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:

or to such other address as the party to whom notice is to be given may have furnished to the other party in writing in accordance herewith. Any such communication shall be deemed to have been given (i) when delivered, if personally delivered, or when telecopied, if telecopied, (ii) on the first Business Day (as hereinafter defined) after dispatch, if sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier and (iii) on the third Business Day following the date on which the piece of mail containing such communication is posted, if sent by mail. As used herein, "Business Day" means a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the city to which the notice or communication is to be sent are not required to be open.

14. No Waiver. No waiver of any breach or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or condition, whether of like or different nature.

15. Optionee Undertaking. The Optionee hereby agrees to take whatever additional actions and execute whatever additional documents the Corporation may in its reasonable judgment deem necessary or advisable in order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions imposed on the Optionee pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement.

16. Modification of Rights. The rights of the Optionee are subject to modification and termination in certain events as provided in this Agreement and the Plan.

INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT

OPTIONEE:  
  
CORPORATION:

SUNVAULT ENERGY, INC.  
  
SECURITY:

Common Stock  
  
AMOUNT:  
  
DATE:  
  
In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Corporation the following:

(a) The Optionee is aware of the Corporation’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Corporation to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Securities. The Optionee is acquiring these Securities for investment for the Optionee’s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

(b) The Optionee acknowledges and understands that the Securities constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act and have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the Optionee’s investment intent as expressed herein. In this connection, the Optionee understands that, in the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if the Optionee’s representation was predicated solely upon a present intention to hold these Securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the market price of the Securities, or for a period of one year or any other fixed period in the future. The Optionee further understands that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The Optionee further acknowledges and understands that the Corporation is under no obligation to register the Securities. The Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Corporation and other legends required under the applicable state or federal securities laws.

Signature of Optionee: _____________________________
