1\. 

Employment. Employer hereby employs Executive, and Executive hereby accepts employment by the Employer, as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and agrees to perform such executive, managerial and administrative duties, commensurate with Executive's position, as Employer may specify from time to time, during the Specified Term as defined in paragraph 2.   
  
2\. 

Effective Date; Specified Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of May 15, 2006 (the “Effective Date”). Subject to earlier termination as provided herein, the term of the Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Date (the "Specified Term"). Employer shall provide ninety (90) days advance written notice to Executive if Executive’s employment will terminate at the end of the Specified Term. If either party to this Agreement chooses not to renew the terms and conditions set forth herein by exercising their rights under this paragraph 2, then Executive’s employment with Employer may continue on an at-will basis and no paragraph, section, duty or obligation appearing in this Agreement shall be binding on the parties except paragraphs 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 22. If Executive remains employed by Employer after the Specified Term, Employer shall provide Executive ninety (90) days notice in advance of the exercise of Employer’s right to terminate Executive at-will. Employer shall also have the right to pay Executive the equivalent of ninety (90) days Base Salary (defined below) in lieu of ninety (90) days notice of an at-will termination.

* * *

  


  


b. 

Bonus Compensation.  Executive shall be entitled to participate in Employer’s discretionary bonus or incentive plan as formulated from time to time by Employer’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

The target bonus for Executive will be fifty percent (50%) of Executive’s Base Salary at the time the Bonus Compensation is paid.   
  
c. 

Executive Benefit Programs. During the Specified Term, Executive shall be entitled to participate in all of Employer's Executive benefit plans (the "Plans") as are generally made available from time to time to Employer's senior executives, subject to the terms and conditions of such plans, and subject to Employer's right to amend, terminate or take other similar actions with respect to such plans. To the extent such Plans include life insurance, the Company agrees to provide Executive life insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable than similarly situated senior executives. The Executive shall receive a maximum reimbursement of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per calendar year for unreimbursed medically necessary expenses incurred in the same calendar year and submitted in accordance with Company expense procedures.   
  
d. 

Business Expense Reimbursements. Employer will pay or reimburse Executive for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including travel expenses, Executive incurs during the Specified Term in the course of performing Executive's duties under this Agreement upon timely submission of appropriate documentation to Employer, as prescribed from time to time by Employer.  
  
  


e.

Unused vacation days cannot be carried forward or banked for future years absent express written consent by a duly authorized representative of the Employer.   
  
  


4\. 

Extent of Services. Executive agrees that the duties and services to be performed by Executive shall be performed exclusively for Employer. Executive further agrees to perform such duties in an efficient, trustworthy, lawful, and businesslike manner. Executive agrees not to render to others any service of any kind whether or not for compensation, or to engage in any other business activity whether or not for compensation, that is similar to or conflicts with the performance of Executive's duties under this Agreement, without the prior written approval of the Board of Directors.  
  
  


* * *

  


  


5\. 

Policies and Procedures. In addition to the terms herein, Executive agrees to be bound by Employer's policies and procedures including drug testing and background checks, as they may be established or amended by Employer in its sole discretion from time to time. In the event the terms in this Agreement conflict with Employer's policies and procedures, the terms herein shall take precedence.   
  
6\. 

Licensing Requirements. Executive acknowledges that Employer is engaged in a business that is or may be subject to and exists because of privileged licenses issued by governmental authorities in Nevada and other jurisdictions in which Employer and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures (collectively “Employer Group”) is engaged in or has applied to engage in or, during the Specified Term, may apply to engage in business. If requested to do so by Employer or Employer Group, Executive shall apply for and obtain any license, qualification, clearance or the like that shall be requested or required of Executive by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over Employer or Employer Group. Additionally, Executive shall timely prepare and submit to Employer all background information forms and other documents required pursuant to The Majestic Star Casino, LLC Gaming Compliance Program.   
  
7\. 

Failure to Satisfy Licensing Requirement. If Executive fails to satisfy any licensing requirement referred to in paragraph 6 above, or if any governmental authority directs the Employer to terminate any relationship it may have with Executive, or if Employer shall determine, in Employer's sole and exclusive judgment, that Executive was, is or might be involved in, or is about to be involved in, any activity, relationship(s) or circumstance that could or does jeopardize the business of Employer or Employer's Group, their reputation or such licenses, or if any such license is threatened to be, or is, denied, curtailed, suspended or revoked, this Agreement may be terminated by Employer and the parties' obligations and responsibilities shall be determined by the provisions of paragraph 11(a).

8\. 

Restrictive Covenants.  
  
a. 

Competition. Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive's responsibilities hereunder, Executive will form relationships and become acquainted with certain confidential and proprietary information as further described herein. Executive further acknowledges that such relationships and information are and will remain valuable to the Employer and Employer Group and that the restrictions on future employment as set forth herein are reasonably necessary in order for Employer and Employer Group to remain competitive in the gaming industry.

The Company, in its sole discretion, may waive one or more of the restrictions set forth in this subparagraph; however, any such waiver must be in writing executed by an authorized Company representative, and shall be effective only to the extent it is set forth in writing.

c.

Non-Solicitation- Employees and Independent Contractors. For the twelve (12) month period immediately following cessation of Executive’s employment with Employer for any reason whatsoever, Executive covenants not to approach or solicit any employee or independent contractor of Employer or any member of the Employer Group with a view towards enticing such person to leave the employ or service of Employer or any member of the Employer Group, or hire or contract with any employee or independent contractor of Employer or any member of the Employer Group, without the prior written consent of the Employer, such consent to be within Employer's sole and absolute discretion.  
  
d.

* * *

  


  


e.

Third Party Information. Executive acknowledges that Employer and other members of the Employer Group have received and in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. Executive will hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose it to any person or entity or to use it except as necessary in carrying out Executive's duties hereunder consistent with Employer's (or such other member of the Employer Group's) agreement with such third party.  
  
f.

Employer's Property. Executive hereby confirms that Trade Secrets, proprietary or confidential information and all information concerning Employer or Employer Group’s customers, goods, services or facilities owned, operated or managed by Employer constitute Employer's exclusive property (regardless of whether Executive possessed or claims to have possessed such information prior to the date hereof). Executive agrees that upon termination of employment, Executive shall promptly return to the Employer all documents, papers, notes, notebooks, memoranda, computer disks, and any other similar repositories of information (regardless of whether Executive possessed such information prior to the date hereof) containing or relating in any way to the Trade Secrets or proprietary or confidential information of each member of the Employer Group, including but not limited to, the documents referred to in paragraph 9(c). Such repositories of information also include but are not limited to any so-called personal files or other personal data compilations in any form, which in any manner contain any Trade Secrets or proprietary or confidential information of Employer or any member of the Employer Group.  
  
g.

9\. 

Representations. Executive hereby represents, warrants and agrees with Employer that:  
  
a.

The covenants and agreements contained in paragraphs 4 and 8 above are reasonable, appropriate and suitable in their geographic scope, duration and content; the Employer's agreement to employ the Executive and a portion of the compensation and consideration to be paid to Executive hereunder is separate and partial consideration for such covenants and agreements; the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, raise any issue of the reasonableness, appropriateness and suitability of the geographic scope, duration or content of such covenants and agreements in any proceeding to enforce such covenants and agreements; and such covenants and agreements shall survive the termination of this Agreement, in accordance with their terms;  
  
  


* * *

  


  


b.

The enforcement of any remedy under this Agreement will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood, because Executive's past work history and abilities are such that Executive can reasonably expect to find work in other areas and lines of business;  
  
c.

The covenants and agreements stated in paragraphs 4, 6, 7 and 8 above are essential for the Employer's reasonable protection;   
  
d.

Employer has reasonably relied on these covenants and agreements by Executive; and  
  
e.

Executive has the full right to enter into this Agreement and by entering into and performance of this Agreement will not violate or conflict with any arrangements or agreements Executive may have or agreed to have with any other person or entity.  
  
f.

Executive acknowledges and warrants to Employer the receipt and sufficiency of separate consideration for the assignment by Employer of Employer's rights and Executive's obligation under paragraph 8.  
  
Notwithstanding paragraph 19, Executive agrees that in the event of Executive's breach or threatened breach of any covenants and agreements set forth in paragraphs 4 and 8 above, Employer may seek to enforce such covenants and agreements in court through any equitable remedy, including specific performance or injunction, without waiving any claim for damages. In any such event, Executive waives any claim that the Employer has an adequate remedy at law or for the posting of a bond.

10\.

11\. 

Termination by Employer  
  
a. 

For Cause. Employer may terminate Executive's employment hereunder for Cause (as defined below) at any time. If Employer terminates Executive's employment for Cause, Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefits hereunder or otherwise from Employer or any member of the Employer Group on and after the effective date of termination of employment other than: (1) unpaid Base Salary earned to the date of termination of employment (which shall be paid on Employer's next scheduled payroll date), (2) business expense reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 3(d), and (3) benefits provided pursuant to paragraph 3(c), subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto. For purposes of this paragraph 11, Cause is defined as Executive's:   
  
i. 

willful failure to perform his duties under this Agreement, willful malfeasance in the performance of his duties under this Agreement;  
  
ii. 

willful failure to abide by Employer's policies and procedures;  
  
iii. 

failure to obtain or retain in full force and effect any material permits, licenses, approvals or other authorizations which may be required by any state or local authorities, including but not limited to, any relevant State and local gaming authorities, in order to permit Executive to continue his services as contemplated by this Agreement;  
  
iv. 

failure to follow the business-related direction of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Chairman of the Board or the entire Board, including, without limitation, with respect to the hiring and termination of other executives and consultants of the Company;  
  
v. 

conviction of any felony or crime involving moral turpitude; and  
  
vi. 

commission of fraud or embezzlement or similar dishonesty with respect to the Company.  
  
Should Employer believe that cause exists to terminate Executive, Employer agrees to provide written notice to Executive of the specific items identified as cause and afford Executive a period of thirty (30) business days from receipt of the written notice to remedy the deficiencies to Employer's satisfaction. If, at the conclusion of the cure period, Employer determines Executive has not satisfactorily remedied the deficiency, Employer shall notify Executive who shall be immediately terminated. Nothing in this paragraph 11 precludes Employer from immediately terminating Executive's employment if Executive is convicted of felonious criminal conduct, physically aggressive conduct toward any co-worker, patron, vendor or customer of Employer, illegal drug use, or based upon any gaming authority's demand that Employer do so.

b.

Without Cause. Employer may terminate Executive at any time during the Specified Term upon ninety (90) days’ written notice, or, in the Employer’s sole discretion, the equivalent of ninety (90) days’ Base Salary in lieu of notice. In addition to any amount due in lieu of notice, should Employer terminate Executive’s employment without cause, then Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefits hereunder or otherwise from Employer or any member of the Employer Group on or after the effective date of termination of employment other than: (1) unpaid Base Salary earned to the date of termination of employment plus the equivalent of an additional twelve (12) months Base Salary or the remainder of annual Base Salary due under this Agreement, whichever is less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the additional Base Salary payment under this subsection (1) be no less than six (6) months; (2) earned but unpaid Bonus Compensation under Paragraph 3 (b) prorated for the period of employment during the applicable bonus period, (3) business expense reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 3 (d), (4) benefits provided pursuant to paragraph 3(c), subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto, and (5) Employer paid COBRA benefits for a period of six (6) months following termination; and (6) any earned and unused vacation.

12\. 

Termination By Executive  
  
a. 

For Good Reason. Executive may terminate Executive's employment hereunder for Good Reason upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Employer. “Good Reason” shall mean: (a) failure of Employer to pay Executive's compensation when due, (b) material reductions in Executive's duties and responsibilities without his consent, or (c) following a Change in Control. "Change in Control" means: (i) a sale, exchange or transfer of more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company on a consolidated basis or more than 50% of its stock; (ii) a merger or consolidation of the Company (excluding merger or consolidation where the voting securities of the Company prior to the merger or consolidation continue to represent more than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving entity after the merger or consolidation), (iii) any reorganization, reverse stock split or recapitalization that would result in a change in control, (iv) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (v) any transactions or series of related transactions having the same effect as a Change in Control. Should there be a change in control, Executive shall be entitled to: (1) unpaid Base Salary earned to the date of termination of employment plus the equivalent of an additional twelve (12) months Base Salary or the remainder of annual Base Salary due under this Agreement, whichever is less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the additional Base Salary payment under this subsection (1) be no less than six (6) months; (2) earned but unpaid Bonus Compensation under Paragraph 3 (b) prorated for the period of employment during the applicable bonus period, (3) business expense reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 3 (d), (4) benefits provided pursuant to paragraph 3(c), subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto, and (5) Employer paid COBRA benefits for a period of six (6) months following termination; and (6) any earned and unused vacation.  
  
Good Reason shall not exist unless Executive first provides Employer’s Board of Directors with written notice of the facts alleged to constitute Good Reason and until such breach, reduction or requirement remains uncured for twenty (20) business days following the Board of Director’s receipt of such written notice from Executive. This twenty (20) business day cure period shall not apply to a Change in Control. 

  


* * *

  


  


Should Executive terminate his employment for Good Reason other than a Change of Control, then Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefits hereunder or otherwise from Employer or any member of the Employer Group on or after the effective date of termination of employment other than: (1) unpaid Base Salary earned to the date of termination of employment plus the equivalent of an additional twelve (12) months Base Salary or the remainder of Base Salary due under this Agreement, whichever is less, (2) unpaid Bonus Compensation under Paragraph 3(c) prorated for the period of employment, (3) business expense reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 3(d), (4) benefits provided pursuant to paragraph 3(c), subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto, and (5) Employer paid COBRA benefits for a period six (6) months following termination; and (6) any earned and unused vacation.

  


b. Without Good Reason. Executive may terminate his employment for any reason other than Good Reason, death or disability, upon providing to Employer thirty (30) days advance written notice of such termination. Should Executive terminate his employment for a reason other than Good Reason, death or disability, Executive shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder or otherwise from Employer or any member of the Employer Group on and after the effective date of termination other than: (1) unpaid Base Salary earned to the date of termination of employment (which shall be paid on Employer's next scheduled payroll date), (2) business expense reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 3(d), and (3) benefits provided pursuant to paragraph 3(c), subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto.

  


13\. 

Release; Full Satisfaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no payments or benefits shall be provided that are in addition to the payments or benefits that would be provided pursuant to paragraphs 11(b) and 12(a) unless and until Executive executes and delivers a standard form of general release of claims, and such release has become irrevocable; provided, however, that Executive shall not be required to release any indemnification rights or continuing rights to benefits under Employer's benefit plans, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans.  
  
14\. 

Cooperation Following Termination. Following termination of Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, Executive agrees to cooperate with Employer upon the reasonable request of the Board of Directors and to be reasonably available to Employer with respect to matters arising out of Executive's services. Employer shall reimburse, or at Executive's request, advance Executive for expenses reasonably incurred in connection with such matters.  
  
  


* * *

  


  


15\. 

Interpretation; Each Party the Drafter. Each of the parties was represented by or had the opportunity to consult with counsel who either participated in the formulation and documentation of, or was afforded the opportunity to review and provide comments on, this Agreement. Accordingly, this Agreement and the provisions contained in it shall not be construed or interpreted for or against any party to this agreement because that party drafted or caused that party's legal representative to draft any of its provisions.  
  
16\. 

Severability. If any provision hereof is unenforceable, illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such fact shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, except in the event a law or court decision, whether on application for declaration, or preliminary injunction or upon final judgment, declares one or more of the provisions of this Agreement that impose restrictions on Executive unenforceable or invalid because of the geographic scope or time duration of such restriction. In such event, Employer shall have the option:  
  
(a) To deem the invalidated restrictions retroactively modified to provide for the maximum geographic scope and time duration that would make such provisions enforceable and valid; or

(b) To terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraph 11(a) or 11(b), whichever is applicable.

Exercise of any of these options shall not affect Employer's right to seek damages or such additional relief as may be allowed by law in respect to any breach by Executive of the enforceable provisions of this Agreement.

17\. 

Notice. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (i) when personally delivered, (ii) when delivered by facsimile upon receipt of confirmation that the transmission was successful, (iii) the business day following the day when deposited with a reputable and established overnight express courier (charges prepaid), or (iv) five (5) days following mailing by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.
