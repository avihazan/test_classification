8\. Other Activities, Non-Solicitation. During the term of this Agreement, You shall not engage in any activities that are competitive with Acacia, or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or that would result in a conflict of interest. You are not prohibited from engaging in any other activities.

9\. Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to enforce its rights under this Agreement specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in its favor. The parties agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief without the need for an undertaking in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Agreement.

10\. Assignment. This Agreement is personal to You and may not be assigned in any way by You without the prior written consent of Acacia. Any such attempted assignment without Acacia's written consent shall be void.

11\. Severability and Reformation. The parties intend all provisions of this Agreement to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If, however, any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision were never a part hereof and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Moreover, any provision so affected shall be limited only to the extent necessary to bring the Agreement within the applicable requirements of law.

12\. Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly within such State, and without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.

13\. Arbitration. Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, the alleged breach thereof, and/or your employment with Acacia or its termination including, without limitation, claims for breach of any express or implied contract, tort claims, claims for violation of any federal, state or other governmental law, statute, ordinance, Executive Order or regulation, and any and all claims for employment discrimination or harassment, shall be determined by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its National Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes ("Rules") which are in effect at the time of the arbitration. The Rules are hereby incorporated by reference. California Code of Civil Procedure § 1283.05, which provides for certain discovery rights, shall apply to any such arbitration, and said code section is also hereby incorporated by reference. In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall have no authority to change, extend, modify or suspend any of the terms of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be commenced and heard in Los Angeles County, California. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of California or federal law, or both, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted. The Arbitrator shall issue a written decision explaining his/his award. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, even if a party who received notice under the Rules fails to appear at the arbitration hearing(s). The parties may seek, from a court of competent jurisdiction, provisional remedies or injunctive relief in support of their respective rights and remedies hereunder without waiving any right to arbitration. However, the merits of any action that involves such provisional remedies or injunctive relief, including, without limitation, the terms of any permanent injunction, shall be determined by arbitration under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims for workers' compensation benefits, unemployment compensation benefits, or claims based upon an employee benefit plan which provides by its own terms for arbitration are exempted from the provisions of this Paragraph. In any arbitration hereunder, the parties will each pay for their costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However, if either party prevails on a statutory claim which entitles the prevailing party to attorneys' fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in accordance with that statute. If any claim or class of claim is determined by applicable law not to be subject to arbitration, this Agreement to arbitrate shall remain in full force and effect with respect to all other claims asserted between the parties.

14\. Entire Agreement, Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the parties, and supersedes any other agreement between Acacia and You, whether oral or in writing, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be altered or amended, nor may any of its provisions be waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto or, in the case of an asserted waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. Waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any breach thereof, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other provision or any subsequent alleged breach of this Agreement.

15\. Survival and Counterparts. The provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, with the same effect as if both parties had signed the same document. All such counterparts shall be deemed an original, shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same instrument.
