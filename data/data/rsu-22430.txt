#### (b) Settlement. Upon the “Settlement Date” (as defined below), each vested Restricted Stock Unit credited to the Account will be settled (and, upon such settlement, shall cease to be credited to the Account) by the Company (i) issuing to the Participant one share of Common Stock for each whole Restricted Stock Unit credited to the Account (such shares, the “RSU Shares”) and making a cash payment to the Participant equal to the Fair Market Value of any fractional Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account and (ii) with respect to the RSU Shares so issued, entering the Participant’s name as a stockholder of record on the books of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Settlement Date” shall mean the earliest of (i) the Participant’s death, (ii) a Change in Control, or (iii) the first anniversary of the date on which the Participant ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than due to his death or, if later, the date of the Participant’s “separation from service” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder).

#### (c) Restrictions. The Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred (other than by will or the laws of decent and distribution) and may not be subject to lien, garnishment, attachment or other legal process. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to the Restricted Stock Units credited to his Account, he has no voting rights with respect to the Company unless and until such Restricted Stock Units are settled in RSU Shares pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof.

#### (d) Effect of Termination of Services.

##### (i) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (ii) of this Section 3(d) or the Plan, if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates prior to the Vesting Date for any reason, the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account shall be forfeited without further consideration to the Participant.

##### (ii) Upon the termination of Participant’s service with the Company due to his death, the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account shall become one hundred (100%) vested and non-forfeitable.

#### (e) Dividends. If on any date the Company pays any dividend with respect to its Common Stock (the “Payment Date”), then the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account shall on the Payment Date be increased by that number of Restricted Stock Units equal to: (i) the product of (x) the number of Restricted Stock Units in the Account as of the Payment Date and (y) the per share cash amount of such dividend (or, in the case of a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or in property other than cash, the per share equivalent cash value of such dividend, as determined in good faith by the Board), divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Payment Date. Each additional Restricted Stock Unit, or fraction thereof, credited to the Account in accordance with this Section 3(e) shall vest and be settled at the same time as the original Restricted Stock Units to which they are attributable.

#### (f) Taxes.
