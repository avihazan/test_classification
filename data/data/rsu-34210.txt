Payment of Withholding

Taxes:

If at any time the Company becomes obligated to withhold any amount for federal, state or local taxes imposed as a result of the grant of this Restricted Stock to you, including, without limitation, any employment tax, income tax, F.I.C.A., or state disability insurance (the date upon which the Company becomes so obligated shall be referred to herein as the “Withholding Date”), then you shall pay any such tax liability, in cash or by check with immediately available funds, to the Company on or before the Withholding Date or shall assign to the Company from the proceeds of any agreed upon sale of Restricted Stock the amount necessary to pay the tax liability. Execution of this Agreement constitutes your authorization and consent to the Company withholding the full amount of any tax liability from compensation or other amounts due and otherwise payable to you in the event that you do not pay the tax liability to the Company on or before the Withholding Date or assign to the Company sufficient proceeds from a sale of Restricted Stock to pay the tax liability and you further agree that any such withholding and payment of any tax liability by the Company to the relevant taxing authority shall constitute full satisfaction of the Company’s obligation to pay such compensation or other amounts to you.

In addition to the foregoing, all or any portion of the taxes required to be withheld by the Company in connection with the exercise, vesting, settlement or transfer of any Restricted Stock award, may, at your election, be paid by the Company by withholding shares of the Company’s capital stock otherwise issuable or subject to the Restricted Stock Award, having a fair market value equal to the amount required or elected to be withheld or paid. Any such election is subject to such conditions or procedures as may be established by the Committee and may be subject to disapproval by the Committee.  
  
Taxable Income and

Section 83(b) Election:

You understand that the taxable income recognized by you as a result of the award of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and the overall tax liability and Withholding Date would be affected by your decision within 30 days of the Grant Date to make an election under Section 83(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code (an “83(b) Election”). You understand and agree that it is your sole responsibility to decide whether to make an 83(b) Election with respect to the award of Restricted Stock and for properly making the election and filing the proper form with the relevant taxing authorities on a timely basis. You acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not rely on the Company for advice in connection with this decision and you further ackno wledge that the Company has advised you to contact your own tax advisor to discuss the desirability of making an 83(b) Election with respect to this grant. You further agree that it is your responsibility to timely notify the Company of your decision and to immediately submit to the Company a signed copy of any 83(b) Election form that you file with respect to this grant of Restricted Stock and to pay applicable withholding taxes to the Company at the time that the 83(b) Election is filed.

This Performance-Based Award will be based upon achievement of the Audited Adjusted EBITDA and the Total Stockholder Return (change in share price plus any dividends) from fiscal year 20X1 through fiscal year 20X3.

  


The Restricted Stock award will vest upon meeting the performance targets weighted fifty percent (50%) on the Company’s three-year cumulative Audited Adjusted EBITDA Target and fifty percent (50%) on the Company achieving the Total Stockholder Return Target. Vesting shall occur on the date the Compensation Committee certifies the attainment of the targets, if any, provided you are employed on such date.

  


The fiscal year 20X1 through fiscal year 20X3 cumulative three-year Audited Adjusted EBITDA Target is $__________.

  


The fiscal year 20X1 through fiscal year 20X3 cumulative three-year Total Stockholder Return Target is ____% (inclusive of dividends) calculated from the last trading day of fiscal year 20X0 of June XX, 20X0 with a closing price of $____. The appreciation in share price will be measured based upon the average closing price for the ten (10) trading days prior to the end of fiscal year 20X3.

  


The potential vesting of the Restricted Stock is based upon the Audited Adjusted EBITDA Target and the Total Stockholder Return Target shall operate independent of one another. The portion of the Restricted Stock that does not vest as a result of the failure to meet the targets shall be forfeited on the date the Compensation Committee certifies the attainment of the targets.
