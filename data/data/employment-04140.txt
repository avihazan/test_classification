1. Employment.  Executive is employed as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company. Executive shall perform all duties and shall have all powers which are commonly incident to those offices. During the term of this Agreement, Executive also agrees to serve, if elected, as an officer and/or director of any subsidiary of the Company and in such capacity will carry out such duties and responsibilities as are reasonably appropriate to those offices.

c.

In the absence of action by the Board, Executive shall continue to receive salary at the annual rate specified on the Effective Date or, if another rate has been established under the provisions of this Section 4, the rate last properly established by action of the Board under the provisions of this Section 4.

10\. Loyalty and Confidentiality.

  


a.

During the term of this Agreement and except for illnesses, reasonable vacation periods, and reasonable leaves of absence, Executive: (i) shall devote his full business time, attention, skill, and efforts to the faithful performance of his duties hereunder; provided, however, that from time to time, Executive may serve on the boards of directors of, and hold any other offices or positions in, companies or organizations which will not present any conflict of interest with the Company or any of its affiliates or unfavorably affect the performance of Executive’s duties pursuant to this Agreement, or violate any applicable statute or regulation and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity contrary to the business affairs or interests of the Company or its affiliates. “Full business time” is hereby defined as that amount of time usually devoted to like companies and institutions by similarly situated executive officers.

Executive further agrees that, unless required by law or specifically permitted by the Board in writing, he will not disclose to any person or entity, either during or subsequent to his employment, any of the above-mentioned information which is not generally known to the public, nor shall he employ such information in any way other than for the benefit of the Company and its affiliates.

c. Disability.

  


i.

The Board or Executive may terminate Executive’s employment after having determined Executive has a Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means a physical or mental infirmity that impairs Executive’s ability to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement and that results in Executive becoming eligible for long-term disability benefits under any long-term disability plans of the Company or the Bank (or, if there are no such plans in effect, that impairs Executive’s ability to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days). The Board shall determine whether or not Executive is and continues to be permanently disabled for purposes of this Agreement in good faith, based upon competent medical advice and other factors that they reasonably believe to be relevant. As a condition to any benefits, the Board may require Executive to submit to such physical or mental evaluations and tests as it deems reasonably appropriate.  
  
  


* * *

  


ii.

In the event of such Disability, Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits provided for under this Agreement for (1) any period during the term of this Agreement and prior to the establishment of Executive’s Disability during which Executive is unable to work due to the physical or mental infirmity, and (2) any period of Disability which is prior to Executive’s termination of employment pursuant to this Section 11c.; provided, however, that any benefits paid pursuant to the Company’s or the Bank’s long-term disability plan will continue as provided in such plan without reduction for payments made pursuant to this Agreement. During any period that Executive receives disability benefits and to the extent that Executive shall be physically and mentally able to do so, he shall furnish such information, assistance and documents so as to assist in the continued ongoing business of the Company and, if able, he shall make himself available to the Company to undertake reasonable assignments consistent with his prior position and his physical and mental health. The Company shall pay all reasonable expenses incident to the performance of any assignment given to Executive during the Disability period.  
  
  


d. Termination for Cause.

  


i.

The Board may, by written notice to Executive in the form and manner specified in this paragraph, immediately terminate his employment at any time, for “Cause.” Executive shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause except for vested benefits. Termination for Cause shall mean termination because of, in the good faith determination of the Board, Executive’s:

(7)

Material breach by Executive of any provision of this Agreement.  
  
  


ii.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless there shall have been delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of such Board called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive to be heard before the Board with counsel), of finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of the conduct described above and specifying the particulars thereof.  
  
  


* * *

  


e.

Voluntary Termination by Executive. In addition to his other rights to terminate under this Agreement, Executive may voluntarily terminate employment during the term of this Agreement upon at least ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to the Board, in which case Executive shall receive only his compensation, vested rights and employee benefits up to the date of his termination.  
  
  


f. Without Cause or With Good Reason.

  


i.

In addition to termination pursuant to Sections 11a. through 11e., the Board may, by written notice to Executive, immediately terminate his employment at any time for a reason other than Cause (a termination “Without Cause”) and Executive may, by written notice to the Board, immediately terminate this Agreement at any time within ninety (90) days following an event constituting “Good Reason,” as defined below (a termination “With Good Reason”).  
  
  


ii.

Subject to Section 12 of this Agreement, in the event of termination under this Section 11f., Executive shall be entitled to receive his base salary for the remaining term of the Agreement paid in one lump sum within ten (10) calendar days of such termination. Also, in such event, Executive shall, for the remaining term of the Agreement, receive the benefits he would have received during the remaining term of the Agreement under any retirement programs (whether tax-qualified or non-qualified) in which Executive participated prior to his termination (with the amount of the benefits determined by reference to the benefits received by Executive or accrued on his behalf under such programs during the twelve (12) months preceding his termination) and continue to participate in any benefit plans that provide health (including medical and dental), life or disability insurance, or similar coverage, upon terms no less favorable than the most favorable terms provided to senior executives during such period. In the event that the Company or the Bank are unable to provide such coverage by reason of Executive no longer being an employee, the Company or the Bank shall provide Executive with comparable coverage on an individual policy basis.  
  
  


iii.

“Good Reason” shall exist if, without Executive’s express written consent, the Company or the Bank materially breach any of their respective obligations under this Agreement. Without limitation, such a material breach shall be deemed to occur upon any of the following:  
  
  


(1)

A material reduction in Executive’s responsibilities or authority in connection with his employment;  
  
  


(2)

Assignment to Executive of duties of a non-executive nature or duties for which he is not reasonably equipped by his skills and experience;

(7) Liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the Bank.

  


iv.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a reduction or elimination of Executive’s benefits under one or more benefit plans maintained by the Company and the Bank as part of a good faith, overall reduction or elimination of such plans or benefits thereunder applicable to all participants in a manner that does not discriminate against Executive (except as such discrimination may be necessary to comply with law) shall not constitute an event of Good Reason or a material breach of this Agreement, provided that benefits of the type or to the general extent as those offered under such plans prior to such reduction or elimination are not available to other officers of the Company orthe Bank or any company that controls either of them under a plan or plans in or under which Executive is not entitled to participate.

i.

12\. Termination in Connection with a Change in Control.

  


a.

For purposes of this Agreement, a “Change in Control” means any of the following events:  
  
  


i.

Merger: The Company merges into or consolidates with another corporation, or merges another corporation into the Company, and as a result less than a majority of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation immediately after the merger or consolidation is held by persons who were stockholders of the Company immediately before the merger or consolidation.  
  
  


* * *

  


ii.

Acquisition of Significant Share Ownership: The Company files, or is required to file, a report on Schedule 13D or another form or schedule (other than Schedule 13G) required under Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if the schedule discloses that the filing person or persons acting in concert has or have become the beneficial owner of 25% or more of a class of the Company’s voting securities, but this clause (b) shall not apply to beneficial ownership of Company voting shares held in a fiduciary capacity by an entity of which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of its outstanding voting securities.

iv.

Sale of Assets: The Company sells to a third party all or substantially all of its assets.  
  
  


Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form constitute a “Change in Control” for purposes of this Agreement.

  


b.

Termination. If within the period ending one year after a Change in Control, (i) the Company and the Bank shall terminate Executive’s employment Without Cause, or (ii) Executive voluntarily terminates his employment with Good Reason, the Company and the Bank shall, within ten calendar days of the termination of Executive’s employment, make a lump-sum cash payment to him equal to three times Executive’s average Annual Compensation over the five (5) most recently completed calendar years ending with the year immediately preceding the effective date of the Change in Control. In determining Executive’s average Annual Compensation, Annual Compensation shall include base salary and any other taxable income, including, but not limited to, amounts related to the granting, vesting or exercise of restricted stock or stock option awards, commissions, bonuses (whether paid or accrued for the applicable period), as well as retirement benefits, director or committee fees and fringe benefits paid or to be paid to Executive or paid for Executive’s benefit during any such year, profit sharing, employee stock ownership plan and other retirement contributions or benefits, including to any tax-qualified plan or arrangement (whether or not taxable) made or accrued on behalf of Executive for such years.

Executive’s rights under Section 11f. are not otherwise affected by this Section 12. Also, in such event, Executive shall, for a thirty-six (36) month period following his termination of employment, receive the benefits he would have received over such period under any retirement programs (whether tax-qualified or non-tax-qualified) in which Executive participated prior to his termination (with the amount of the benefits determined by reference to the benefits received by Executive or accrued on his behalf under such programs during the twelve (12) months preceding the Change in Control) and continue to participate in any benefit plans of the Company or the Bank that provide health (including medical and dental), life or disability insurance, or similar coverage upon terms no less favorable than the most favorable terms provided to senior executives during such period. In the event that the Company or the Bank are unable to provide such coverage by reason of Executive no longer being an employee, the Company or the Bank shall provide Executive with comparable coverage on an individual policy basis or the cash equivalent.  
  
  


* * *

  


c.

The provisions of Section 12 and Sections 14 through 26, including the defined terms used in such sections, shall continue in effect until the later of the expiration of this Agreement or one year following a Change in Control.  
  
  


13\. Indemnification and Liability Insurance.

  


a.

Indemnification. The Company agrees to indemnify Executive (and his heirs, executors, and administrators), and to advance expenses related thereto, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and regulations against any and all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by him in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding in which he may be involved by reason of his having been a director or Executive of the Company or any of its affiliates (whether or not he continues to be a director or Executive at the time of incurring any such expenses or liabilities), such expenses and liabilities to include, but not be limited to, judgments, court costs, and attorneys’ fees and the costs of reasonable settlements, such settlements to be approved by the Board, if such action is brought against Executive in his capacity as an Executive or director. Indemnification for expenses shall not extend to matters for which Executive has been terminated for Cause. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide indemnification prohibited by applicable law or regulation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of this Section 13 shall survive the term of this Agreement by a period of six (6) years.  
  
  


b.

Insurance. During the period in which indemnification of Executive is required under this Section, the Company shall provide Executive (and his heirs, executors, and administrators) with coverage under a directors’ and officers’ liability policy at the expense of the Company, at least equivalent to such coverage provided to directors and senior executives of the Company or the Bank.  
  
  


14. Reimbursement of Executive’s Expenses to Enforce this Agreement. The Company shall reimburse Executive for all out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by Executive in connection with successful enforcement by Executive of the obligations of the Company to Executive under this Agreement. Successful enforcement shall mean the grant of an award of money or the requirement that the Company and the Bank take some action specified by this Agreement: (i) as a result of a court order; or (ii) otherwise following an initial failure of the Company to pay such money or take such action promptly after written demand therefor from Executive stating the reason that such money or action was due under this Agreement at or prior to the time of such demand.

  


15. Limitation of Benefits under Certain Circumstances. If the payments and benefits pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which Executive has the right to receive from the Company or the Bank, would constitute a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, the payments and benefits pursuant to Section 12 shall be reduced or revised, in the manner determined by Executive, by the amount, if any, which is the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits under Section 12 being non-deductible to the Company pursuant to Section 280G of the Code and subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. The determination of any reduction in the payments and benefits to be made pursuant to Section 12 shall be based upon the opinion of the Company independent public accountants and paid for by the Company. In the event that the Company or Executive do not agree with the opinion of such counsel, (i) the Company shall pay to Executive the maximum amount of payments and benefits pursuant to Section 12, as selected by Executive, which such opinion indicates there is a high probability do not result in any of such payments and benefits being non-deductible to the Company and subject to the imposition of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code and (ii) the Company may request, and Executive shall have the right to demand that it request, a ruling from the IRS as to whether the disputed payments and benefits pursuant to Section 12 have such consequences. Any such request for a ruling from the IRS shall be promptly prepared and filed by the Company, but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of the opinion of counsel referred to above, and shall be subject to Executive’s approval prior to filing, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company, the Bank and Executive agree to be bound by any ruling received from the IRS and to make appropriate payments to each other to reflect any such rulings, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. Nothing contained herein shall result in a reduction of any payments or benefits to which Executive may be entitled upon termination of employment other than pursuant to Section 12 hereof, or a reduction in the payments and benefits specified in Section 12 below zero.

  


* * *

  


16. Injunctive Relief. If there is a breach or threatened breach of Section 11g. of this Agreement or the prohibitions upon disclosure contained in Section 10c. of this Agreement, the parties agree that there is no adequate remedy at law for such breach, and that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief restraining Executive from such breach or threatened breach, but such relief shall not be the exclusive remedy hereunder for such breach. The parties hereto likewise agree that Executive, without limitation, shall be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.

  


17. Source of Payments. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that payments and benefits, as provided by this Agreement, are paid to or received by Executive under the Employment Agreement in effect between the Executive and the Bank (the “Bank Agreement”), such compensation payments and benefits paid by the Bank will be subtracted from any amount due simultaneously to Executive under similar provisions of this Agreement. Payments pursuant to this Agreement and the Bank Agreement shall be allocated in proportion to the activities by Executive as determined by the Company and the Bank.

  


18\. Successors and Assigns.

  


a.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any corporate or other successor of the Company which shall acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company.  
  
  


b.

Since the Company is contracting for the unique and personal skills of Executive, Executive shall be precluded from assigning or delegating his rights or duties hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of the Company.  
  
  


19. No Mitigation. Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation or benefits provided to Executive in any subsequent employment.

  


20. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications in connection with this Agreement shall be made in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered by hand or 48 hours after mailing at any general or branch United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Company at its principal business offices and to Executive at his home address as maintained in the records of the Company.

* * *

  


21. No Plan Created by this Agreement.  Executive and the Company expressly declare and agree that this Agreement was negotiated among them and that no provision or provisions of this Agreement are intended to, or shall be deemed to, create any plan for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or any other law or regulation, and each party expressly waives any right to assert the contrary. Any assertion in any judicial or administrative filing, hearing, or process that such a plan was so created by this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by the party making such an assertion.

  


22. Amendments. No amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless made in writing and signed by all of the parties, except as herein otherwise specifically provided.

  


23. Applicable Law. Except to the extent preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Kentucky shall govern this Agreement in all respects, whether as to its validity, construction, capacity, performance or otherwise.

  


24. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

  


25. Headings. Headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only.

  


26. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any understanding or modifications thereof as agreed to in writing by the parties, shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than written agreements with respect to specific plans, programs or arrangements described in Sections 5 and 6.

  


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the date first set forth above.

Amendment

to the

Holding Company

Employment Agreement

This Amendment to the Employment Agreement is entered into as of December 22, 2008, by and between Kentucky First Federal Bancorp (the “Company”) and R. Clay Hulette (the “Executive”).

WHEREAS, the Executive is currently employed as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company previously entered into an Employment Agreement dated August 15, 2008 (the “Employment Agreement”); and

WHEREAS, the parties to the Employment Agreement desire to amend the Employment Agreement to bring it into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree to amend the Employment Agreement as follows:

  


A new Section 27 is added to the Employment Agreement read as follows:

  


27\. Section 409A

  


(i) The Executive will be deemed to have a termination of employment for purposes of determining the timing of any payments that are classified as deferred compensation only upon a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.

(ii) If at the time of the Executive’s separation from service, (a) the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A and using the methodology selected by the Company) and (b) the Company make a good faith determination that an amount payable or the benefits to be provided hereunder constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A), the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to the six-month delay rule of Section 409A in order to avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A, then the Company will not pay the entire amount on the otherwise scheduled payment date but will instead pay on the scheduled payment date the maximum amount permissible in order to comply with Section 409A (i.e., any amount that satisfies an exception under the Section 409A rules from being categorized as deferred compensation) and will pay the remaining amount (if any) in a lump sum on the first business day after such six month period. 

(iii) To the extent the Executive would be subject to an additional 20% tax imposed on certain deferred compensation arrangements pursuant to Section 409A as a result of any provision of this Agreement, such provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to avoid application of such tax and the parties shall promptly execute any amendment reasonably necessary to implement this Section 27. The Executive and the Company agree to cooperate to make such amendment to the terms of this Agreement as may be necessary to avoid the imposition of penalties and taxes under Section 409A; provided, however, that the Executive agrees that any such amendment shall provide the Executive with economically equivalent payments and benefits, and the Executive agrees that any such amendment will not materially increase the cost to, or liability of, the Company with respect to any payment.

  


* * *

  


(iv) For purposes of the this Agreement, Section 409A shall refer to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury regulations and any other authoritative guidance issued thereunder.

  


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed and delivered this Amendment to the Employment Agreement, or have caused this Amendment to the Employment Agreement to be duly executed and delivered in their name and on their behalf, as of the day and year first above written.
