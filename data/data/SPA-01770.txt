# 1. Exercise of Option.

# 

## 1.1. I am exercising my right to purchase the number of shares of common stock of MacroPore Biosurgery, Inc. indicated on Line (H) by exercising the option identified on Lines (D) through (G). The per share purchase price of the option is indicated on Line (E) and the aggregate purchase price of the shares I am purchasing is indicated on Line (I). I acknowledge that I may be responsible for tax withholding on the shares, in which case the aggregate purchase price would be as indicated on Line (K) (which the Company will complete). The shares that I am purchasing by exercising my option are referred to in this agreement as the “Shares”. The total purchase price of the shares is referred to in this agreement as the “Purchase Price”. I acknowledge that the option I am exercising was issued under and is subject to the rules of the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan of MacroPore Biosurgery, Inc. (the “Plan”).

## 

## 1.2. With this signed agreement, I have submitted either (a) cash or a check for the amount of the Purchase Price or (b) irrevocable wire transfer instructions for the Purchase Price, or (c) a certificate or certificates (or designation of such certificates if permitted by the Plan) representing shares of MacroPore Biosurgery, Inc. common stock that I have owned for at least six months if the shares were acquired by me through exercise of an option, and that have a fair market value (as determined in accordance with the Plan) as of this date equal to the Purchase Price. I recognize that other forms of payment may be permitted by the written approval of the Administrator.

## 

# 2. Representations

# 

## 2.1. Taxes. The Company has made no warranties or representations to me with respect to the income tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and I am not relying on the Company or its representatives for an assessment of such tax consequences. I have had adequate opportunity to consult with my personal tax advisor prior to submitting this Agreement to the Company.

## 

## 2.2. Repurchase. If the Shares are subject to a right of repurchase in favor of the Company at their original purchase price when I cease to provide services for the Company, or if I could be subject to suit under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the purchase of the Shares, I will execute and deliver to the Company a copy of the Acknowledgment and Statement of Decision Regarding Election Pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Acknowledgment”) attached as Exhibit A. I acknowledge that I am primarily responsible for filing any Section 83(b) elections although the Company will, as an accommodation to me and without assuming any liability, file a duplicate election if I promptly provide an executed form with the Acknowledgement and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b). I will consult with my own tax advisor to determine if there is a comparable election to file in the state of where I reside and whether filing a federal or state Section 83(b) election is desirable under my circumstances.
