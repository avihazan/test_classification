## 2\. Termination of Employment. If the Participant's employment is terminated during the Restricted Period (i) due to the Participant's death or disability or (ii) due to the Participant's Retirement, the Restricted Stock shall vest on the date of such termination of employment with respect to a prorated number of Shares of Restricted Stock determined by multiplying the total number of Shares subject to this Award times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months having elapsed during the Restricted Period as of the date of such termination of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of whole months in the Restricted Period. For purposes of this Section 2, determination of whether a Participant's employment is terminated due to the Participant's Retirement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee and the Committee's determination shall be final.

##  Retirement means a Participant's termination from employment with the Company or a Subsidiary at the Participant's Early or Normal Retirement Date, as applicable.

## 3\. Vesting of Restricted Stock. Except as provided otherwise in Section 3.2 of the Plan and Sections 1 or 2 of this Annex A, the Restricted Stock shall vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement. Any Shares that do not vest shall be forfeited.

# 4\. Voting Rights, Dividends and Custody.
