7\. Termination of Agreement. The Agreement and the Option granted hereby shall terminate automatically and without further notice on the earliest of the following dates: 

(a) After the Optionee’s termination due to the Optionee’s death or Disability, all vested Option Shares shall remain exercisable until the lesser of (i) one (1) year following the Optionee’s date of termination or (ii) the remaining term of the Option; provided, however, that it shall be a condition to the exercise of the Option in the event of the Optionee’s death that the Person exercising the Option shall (i) have agreed in a form satisfactory to the Company to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement and (ii) comply with all regulations and the requirements of any regulatory authority having control of, or supervision over, the issuance of the shares of common stock and in connection therewith shall execute any documents which the Board shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable. All unvested Option Shares shall remain outstanding for the twelve (12) month period following the date of such termination by reason of death or Disability. To the extent an event or financial result described in Section 4(a) occurs during such twelve (12) month period that would cause some or all of such unvested Option Shares to become vested (a “Post-Termination Vesting Event”), the appropriate number of Option Shares will vest as of such Post-Termination Vesting Event, and remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following such Post-Termination Vesting Event (but not beyond the remaining term of the Option); provided that the occurrence of a Post-Termination Vesting Event as described in the first paragraph of Section 4(a) during such twelve month period shall result in the vesting only of the installment of Option Shares subject to vesting in the calendar year during which (or after which but before the vesting date for such year) the Optionee’s death or Disability occurred. On the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of termination of employment by reason of death or Disability, all remaining unvested Option Shares will be forfeited; 

(b) After the Optionee’s termination by the Company without Cause or by the Optionee for Good Reason, all vested Option Shares shall remain exercisable until the lesser of (i) ninety (90) calendar days following the Optionee’s date of termination or (ii) the remaining term of the Option. All unvested Option Shares shall remain outstanding for the twelve (12) month period following the date of such termination by the Company without Cause or by the Optionee for Good Reason. To the extent a Post-Termination Vesting Event occurs within such twelve (12) month period, the appropriate number of Option Shares will vest as of such Post-Termination Vesting Event, and remain exercisable for ninety (90) calendar days following such Post-Termination Vesting Event (but not beyond the remaining term of the Option); provided that the occurrence of a Post-Termination Vesting Event as described in the first paragraph of Section 4(a) during such twelve month period shall result in the vesting only of the installment of Option Shares subject to vesting in the calendar year during which (or after which but before the vesting date for such year) the Optionee’s termination by the Company without Cause or by the Optionee for Good Reason occurred. On the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of termination of employment by reason of termination by the Company without Cause or by the Optionee with Good Reason, all remaining unvested Option Shares will be forfeited;

(c) The date of the Optionee’s Termination for Cause, upon which all vested and unvested Option Shares will be forfeited immediately and terminate; 

(d) After the Optionee’s termination without Good Reason, all unvested Option Shares will be forfeited immediately and terminate and all vested Option Shares shall remain exercisable until the lesser of (i) ninety (90) calendar days following the Optionee’s date of termination or (ii) the remaining term of the Option; or 

(e) Ten (10) years from the Effective Date. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all termination events other than a termination of the Optionee’s employment for Cause, if the last day to exercise vested Option Shares occurs after the date on which the Company’s common stock is publicly traded on a national stock exchange and during a lock-up period or securities law blackout period, the otherwise applicable post-termination Option exercise period shall continue, but not beyond the remaining term of the Option, until thirty (30) calendar days after the first day when the terminating Optionee is no longer precluded from selling stock acquired upon exercise of Options for either of such reasons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall prohibit the Optionee from exercising his or her vested Options through net exercise, using Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Option, during any lock-up or securities law blackout period to the extent not prohibited by law. 

In the event that the Optionee’s employment is terminated in the circumstances described in Section 7(c) hereof, this Agreement shall terminate at the time of such termination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and the Optionee’s Option will cease to be exercisable to the extent exercisable as of such termination and will not be or become exercisable after such termination. The Optionee shall be deemed to be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary if on a leave of absence approved in writing by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to the extent consistent with Section 409A of the Code. 

8\. Stockholders Agreement. The Optionee agrees that any Option Shares that the Optionee receives pursuant to this Agreement or under the Plan are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. 

9\. No Employment Contract. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a) confer upon the Optionee any right to be employed by or remain employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) limit or affect in any manner the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Optionee.

10\. Dividend Equivalents. Upon the payment of any ordinary or extraordinary cash dividend (or similar distributions) to holders of Company common stock, the Optionee will be credited with dividend equivalent rights with respect to the Options as follows. Dividend equivalents relating to vested Option Shares shall be paid to the Optionee in cash at the same time dividends are paid to holders of Company common stock. Dividend equivalents relating to unvested Option Shares will be credited to a notional account maintained on the books of the Company for the benefit of the Optionee, which account shall not accrue interest. The Optionee will become vested in such account at the same time as the Options to which the dividend equivalents relate vest and become exercisable, and such vested amounts shall be payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date, and in no event later than 2 1/2 months following the end of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs. Unvested amounts held in such account shall be forfeited by the Optionee upon the date of any termination of employment; provided, however, that if such termination results in the continuation of unvested Option Shares, as provided in Sections 7(a) and 7(b), above, forfeiture of dividend equivalents shall be delayed until the twelve (12) month anniversary of such termination, and to the extent that any Option Shares vest during such twelve (12) month period, such related dividend equivalents shall also vest and be paid to the Optionee in cash on the twelve (12) month anniversary of such termination or, if the Options are forfeited, such related dividend equivalents shall also be forfeited. 

11\. Taxes and Withholding. The Company or any Subsidiary may withhold, or require the Optionee to remit to the Company or any Subsidiary, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local or foreign taxes (including the Optionee’s FICA obligation) in connection with any payment made or benefit realized by the Optionee or other person under this Agreement or otherwise, and if the amounts available to the Company or any Subsidiary for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that Optionee or such other person make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or any Subsidiary for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld. The Optionee may elect to have such withholding obligation satisfied by surrendering to the Company or any Subsidiary a portion of the Option Shares that are issued or transferred to the Optionee upon the exercise of an Option (but only to the extent of the minimum withholding required by law), and the Option Shares so surrendered by Optionee shall be credited against any such withholding obligation at the Fair Market Value (which for such purpose shall have the meaning set forth in the Stockholders Agreement) of such Shares on the date of such surrender. 

12\. Compliance with Law. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option shall not be exercisable if the exercise thereof would result in a violation of any such law. 

13\. Adjustments. 

(a) The Board shall make or provide for such substitution or adjustments in the number of Option Shares covered by this Option, in the Option Price applicable to such Option, and in the kind of shares covered thereby and/or such other equitable substitution or adjustments as the Board may determine to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Optionee’s rights that otherwise would result from (i) any stock dividend, extraordinary cash-dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (ii) any merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reclassification, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, or other distribution of assets or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (iii) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing 

\- 6 -

(b) To the extent that any equity securities of any member of the Company’s controlled group become publicly traded, at such time all Options shall be exchanged, in a manner consistent with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code, for options with the same intrinsic value in the publicly-traded entity, and all Shares shall be exchanged for shares of common stock with the same aggregate value of the publicly-traded entity. 

14\. Relation to Other Benefits. Any economic or other benefit to Optionee under this Agreement shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which Optionee may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. 

15\. Amendments. Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto. 

16\. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
