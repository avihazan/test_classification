ACI HOLDING, INC. 1994 STOCK OPTION PLAN

This Stock Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) is made as of__________, by and between Transaction Systems Architects, Inc. (TSA) a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”) and __________, an employee of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the “Optionee”).

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has duly adopted and approved the 1994 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”), which Plan authorizes the Corporation to grant to eligible individuals options for the purchase of shares of the Corporation’s Class A Common Stock (the “Stock”); and

WHEREAS, the Corporation has determined that it is desirable and in its best interests to grant the Optionee, pursuant to the Plan, an option to purchase a certain number of shares of Stock, in order to provide the Optionee with an incentive to advance the interests of the Corporation, all according to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

# 1. GRANT OF OPTION

# 

Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase from the Corporation, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement, __________ shares of Class A Common Stock. The date of grant of this Option is __________.

# 2. TERMS OF PLAN

# 

The Option granted pursuant to this Option Agreement is granted subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan (a copy of which is attached). All terms and conditions of the Plan, as may be amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated into this Option Agreement by reference and shall be deemed to be part of this Option Agreement, without regard to whether such terms and conditions (including, for example, provisions relating to exercise or termination of the Option following the Optionee’s termination of employment, disability, death or retirement or certain changes in capitalization of the Corporation) are not otherwise set forth in this Option Agreement. In the event that there is any inconsistency between the provisions of this Option Agreement and of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern.

# 3. PRICE

# 

The purchase price (the “Option Price” or “Grant Price”) for the shares of Stock subject to the Option granted by this Option Agreement is $__________ per share.

# 4. EXERCISE OF OPTION

# 

Except as otherwise provided herein, and subject to the provisions of the Plan (including restrictions on the transferability of the Option and special provisions relating to exercise or termination of the Option following the Optionee’s termination of employment, disability, death or retirement or certain changes in capitalization of the Corporation), the Option granted pursuant to this Option Agreement shall be subject to exercise as follows:

## 4.1. Time of Exercise of Option

## 

The Optionee may exercise the Option (subject to the limitations on exercise set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan), in installments as follows: on the last day of each month following the date of grant of the Option, as set forth in Section 1 above, the Option shall be exercisable in respect of 1/48th of the number of shares specified in Section 1 above. The foregoing installments, to the extent not exercised, shall accumulate and be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, after becoming exercisable and prior to the termination of the Option; provided, that no single exercise of the Option shall be for less than 100 shares, unless the number of shares purchased is the total number at the time available for purchase under this Option.

## 4.2. Termination of Option

## 

The Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the expiration of a period of (i) ten years from the date of grant of the Option, as set forth in Section 1 above, or (ii) thirty days from the date of the Optionee’s termination of employment with the Corporation or a subsidiary; provided, however, that if such termination of employment falls within the scope of one of the provisions of the Plan providing for an extended exercise period in excess of thirty days, the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of the extended period, as specified in such provision, after the Optionee’s termination of employment with the Corporation or a subsidiary within which the Option is exercisable.

## 4.3. Limitations on Exercise of Option

## 

Notwithstanding the foregoing Subsections, in no event may the Option be exercised, in whole or in part, after ten years following the date upon which the Option is granted, as set forth in Section 4.2 above, or after the occurrence of an event which results in termination of the Option under the Plan. In no event may the Option be exercised for a fractional share.

## 4.4. Method of Exercise of Option

## 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the Option may be exercised by delivering written notice of exercise to the Corporation, at its principal office, addressed to the attention of TSA’s Stock Plan Administrator, which notice shall specify the number of shares for which the Option is being exercised, and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price of the shares for which the Option is being exercised. Payment of the Option Price for the shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall be made either in cash or by check payable to the order of the Corporation. If the person exercising the Option is not the Optionee, such person shall also deliver with the notice of exercise appropriate proof of his or her right to exercise the Option. An attempt to exercise the Option granted hereunder other than as set forth above shall be invalid and of no force and effect. Promptly after exercise of the Option as provided for above, the Corporation shall deliver to the person exercising the Option a certificate or certificates for the shares of Stock being purchased.

## 4.5. Parachute Limitations

## 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Option Agreement or the Plan or any other agreement, contract or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Optionee with the Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof), except an agreement, contract or understanding hereafter entered into that expressly modifies or excludes application of this Subsection (the “Other Agreements”), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangements heretofore or hereafter adopted by the Corporation (or any such subsidiary or affiliate) for the direct or indirect compensation of the Optionee (including groups or classes of participants or beneficiaries of which the Optionee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Optionee (an “Other Benefit Plan”), the Optionee shall not have any right to exercise an Option or receive any payment or other benefit under this Option Agreement, any Other Agreement, or any Other Benefit Plan if such right to exercise, payment or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments or benefits to or for the Optionee under this Option Agreement, all Other Agreements and all Other Benefit Plans, would cause any right, payment or benefit to the Optionee under this Option Agreement to be considered a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code as then in effect (a “Parachute Payment”). In the event that the receipt of any such right to exercise or any other payment or benefit under this Option Agreement, any Other Agreement or any Other Benefit Plan would cause the Optionee to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under this Agreement, then the Optionee shall have the right, in the Optionee’s sole discretion, to designate those rights, payments or benefits under this Option Agreement, any Other Agreements, and/or any Other Benefit Plans, which should be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having the right, payment or benefit to the Optionee under this Option Agreement be deemed to be a Parachute Payment.

## 5.1. Transferability of Options

## 

During the lifetime of an Optionee, only such Optionee (or, in the event of legal incapacity or incompetency, the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative) may exercise the Option. No Option shall be assignable or transferable by the Optionee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

# 6. RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER

# 

Neither the Optionee nor any executor, administrator, distributee or legatee of the Optionee’s estate shall be, or have any of the rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Corporation in respect of any shares of Stock issuable hereunder unless and until such shares have been fully paid and certificates representing such shares have been endorsed, transferred and delivered, and the name of the Optionee (or of such personal representative, administrator, distributee or legatee of the Optionee’s estate) has been entered as the stockholder or record on the books of the Corporation.

# 7. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

# 

The parties hereto recognize that the Corporation or a subsidiary may be obligated to withhold federal and local income taxes and Social Security taxes to the extent that the Optionee realizes ordinary income in connection with the exercise of the Option or in connection with a disposition of any shares of Stock acquired by exercise of the Option. The Optionee agrees that the Corporation or a subsidiary may withhold amounts needed to cover such taxes from payments otherwise due and owing to the Optionee, and also agrees that upon demand the Optionee will promptly pay to the Corporation or a subsidiary having such obligation any additional amounts as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding tax obligation. Such payment shall be made in cash or by check payable to the order of the Corporation or a subsidiary.

# 8. DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

# 

No provision in this Option Agreement shall be construed to confer upon the Optionee the right to be employed by the Corporation or any subsidiary, or to interfere in any way with the right and authority of the Corporation or any subsidiary either or increase or decrease the compensation of the Optionee at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between the Optionee and the Corporation or any subsidiary.

# 9. INTERPRETATION OF THIS OPTION AGREEMENT
