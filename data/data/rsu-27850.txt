As provided in the Plan, in the event of corporate transactions affecting the Company’s outstanding Shares, such as recapitalizations or mergers, the Committee shall equitably adjust the number and kinds of Shares subject to this Option and the exercise price for such Shares, and may take such other action as the Committee may determine to be appropriate pursuant to Section 10 of the Plan.

This Option is not transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the Optionee’s lifetime, only by the Optionee or the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative. The naming of a Beneficiary does not constitute a transfer. 

8\. Compliance with Securities Laws. It shall be a condition to the Optionee’s right to purchase Shares hereunder that the Committee may, in its discretion, require (a) that the Shares reserved for issue upon the exercise of this Option shall have been duly listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, (b) that either (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the Shares shall be in effect, or (ii) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the proposed purchase shall be exempt from registration under that Act and the Optionee shall have made such undertakings and agreements with the Company as the Company may reasonably require, and (c) that such other steps, if any, as counsel for the Company shall consider necessary to comply with any law applicable to the issue of such Shares by the Company shall have been taken by the Company or the Optionee, or both. The certificates representing the Shares purchased under this Option may contain such legends as counsel for the Company shall consider necessary to comply with any applicable law.

The Optionee shall pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the exercise of this Option. The Committee may, in its discretion, require any other Federal or state taxes imposed on the sale of the Shares to be paid by the Optionee. The Optionee may satisfy the withholding requirements pursuant to any one or combination of the following methods:

(a) payment in cash; or

(b) payment by surrendering unrestricted previously held Shares or the withholding of Shares that otherwise would be deliverable to the Optionee pursuant to the Option, which have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the minimum statutory amount, if any, required to be withheld for federal, state, local and/or foreign tax purposes (or such other amount as the Committee determines will not result in additional compensation expense for financial accounting purposes under applicable financial accounting principles). The Optionee may surrender Shares either by attestation or by delivery of a certificate or certificates for Shares duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, and if required with medallion level signature guarantee by a member firm of a national stock exchange, by a national or state bank (or guaranteed or notarized in such other manner as the Committee may require).
