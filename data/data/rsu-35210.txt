(e)(1) In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Appendix A), the Option shall become fully vested as of the date of the Change in Control. 

(2) In the event of a Change in Control pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of Appendix A, the Board of Directors (as constituted prior to such Change in Control) may, in its discretion (subject to existing contractual arrangements), require that the Option, in whole or in part, be surrendered to the Company by the Optionee and be immediately cancelled by the Company, and provide for the Optionee to receive a cash payment from the Company in an amount equal to the number of shares of Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to such cancellation (but after giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan in respect of any transaction that gives rise to such Change in Control), multiplied by the excess, if any, of (i) the greater of (A) the highest per share price offered to holders of common stock in any transaction whereby the Change in Control takes place and (B) the Market Value of a share of Stock on the date on which such Change of Control occurs over (ii) the exercise price.

(4) The Company may, but is not required to, cooperate with the Optionee if the Optionee is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), to assure that any cash payment or substitution in accordance with this Section 2.2(e) to the Optionee is made in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

2.3 Method of Exercise. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Option may be exercised by the Optionee (i) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of whole shares of Stock to be purchased and accompanied by payment therefor in full in cash and (ii) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request.

Except as permitted by the foregoing, the Option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to so sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the Option, the Option and all rights hereunder shall immediately become null and void. 

3.2. Withholding Taxes. As a condition precedent to any exercise of the Option, the Optionee shall, upon request by the Company, pay to the Company (or shall cause a broker-dealer on behalf of the Optionee in accordance with Section 2.3 to pay to the Company) in 

* * *

addition to the purchase price of the shares, such amount of cash as the Company may be required, under all applicable federal, state, local or other laws or regulations, to withhold and pay over as income or other withholding taxes (the “Required Tax Payments”) with respect to such exercise of the Option. If the Optionee shall fail to advance the Required Tax Payments after request by the Company, the Company may, in its discretion, deduct any Required Tax Payments from any amount then or thereafter payable by the Company to the Optionee. 

3.3. Compliance with Applicable Law. The Option is subject to the condition that if the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to the Option upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the purchase or delivery of shares hereunder, the Option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained. The Company agrees to make every reasonable effort to effect or obtain any such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval. 

3.4. Delivery of Certificates. Upon the exercise of the Option, in whole or in part, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered one or more certificates representing the number of shares purchased against full payment therefor. The Company shall pay all original issue or transfer taxes and all fees and expenses incident to such delivery, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2. 

3.5. Option Confers No Rights as Stockholder. The Optionee shall not be entitled to any privileges of ownership with respect to shares of Stock subject to the Option unless and until purchased and delivered upon the exercise of the Option, in whole or in part, and the optionee becomes a stockholder of record with respect to such delivered shares; and the Optionee shall not be considered a stockholder of the Company with respect to any such shares not so purchased and delivered. 

3.6. Option Confers No Rights to Continue to Serve as a Director. In no event shall the granting of the Option or its acceptance by the Optionee give or be deemed to give the Optionee any right to continue to serve, to be elected or reelected to serve or to be nominated to serve as a director of the Company. 

3.7. Decisions of Board or Committee. As provided in the Plan, the Board or the Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions which may arise in connection with the option or its exercise. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Board or the Committee regarding the Plan or this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

3.8. Company to Reserve Shares. The Company shall at all times prior to the expiration or termination of the Option reserve and keep available, either in its treasury or out of its authorized but unissued shares of Stock, the full number of shares subject to the Option from time to time.
