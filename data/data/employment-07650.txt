6\. Termination or Non-Extension by Company Without Just Cause

  


a. 

Employee’s employment by the Company is “at will” therefore, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company may terminate Employee’s full-time employment at any time either with or without just cause. In the event of any termination of Employee’s full-time employment with the Company without just cause, or in the event that Employee’s full-time employment is not extended or renewed beyond the Term on terms at least as favorable to Employee as Employee is receiving during the last year of the Term, then Employee will remain bound to the covenants not to compete and confidentiality obligations of paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Agreement, according to their terms, and, subject to Section 26, each one of the following shall apply:  
  
  


i. Employee shall be paid an amount equal to one-half of her then annual base salary, paid over a period of twelve (12) months from Employee’s termination, in equal monthly installments and at the same intervals as other Employees of the Company are then being paid their base salaries;

  


ii. Employee shall continue to receive, during the twelve (12) months from Employee’s termination, all medical insurance and any other benefits (except for the benefit in paragraph 2(f)(i)) or insurance coverages which Employee would have received had her employment not been so terminated, or not extended, provided however, if the Employee is not eligible for said medical insurance, the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums for continuation coverage during the said twelve (12) month period;

  


iii. Employee shall receive additional compensation for her covenant not to compete equal to the average annual bonus which Employee has received for the three most recent fiscal years during which Employee was employed, provided however that if Employee has not been employed for three full fiscal years, then the Company shall use the actual number of full fiscal years that the Employee was employed; and if the Employee has not been employed for a full fiscal year, than the Company shall use the bonus amount, if any, paid to Employee (but annualized for a full fiscal year) from the most recent partial fiscal year for which the Employee was entitled to a bonus under this Agreement, and the amount due under this paragraph 6(a)(iii) shall be paid in the same intervals as other Employees of the Company are then being paid their base salaries;

v. provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Employee shall perform services during such 12 month period at a level of no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services the Employee performed over the immediately preceding 36 month period such that the Employee shall have incurred a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations on the date of the Employee’s termination of employment.

  


b. 

For purposes hereof, any of the following acts or events shall, at Employee’s option, constitute a termination without just cause under this paragraph 6 (provided, however, that such termination occurs on or within two years of such acts or events):  
  
  


i. any material diminution or reduction of Employee’s title, position, duties or responsibilities, except as caused by the acts or omissions of Employee; or

  


ii. any material breach by Company of this Agreement. .

  


For purposes of this Agreement, a termination without just cause shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Employee provides the Company with notice of the events described above within 90 days of the existence of the events, and the Company is provided at least 30 days to cure the condition.

  


c. 

In the event that, at the end of the Term, the Company elects not to extend or renew Employee’s full-time employment beyond the Term on terms at least favorably to Employee as Employee is receiving during the last fiscal year of the Term, then such non-renewal shall be treated as a termination without cause. In such case, the provisions of paragraphs 6(a)(i) through (iv) shall apply and Employee shall be bound to the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 hereof for the period of time during which Employee is being paid pursuant to paragraph 6(a).  
  
  


7\. Early Termination by Company for Just Cause. The Company may terminate Employee for just cause. In the event the Company terminates the Employee for just cause, the Employee will remain bound under the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, but will not be entitled to any compensation or benefits following her termination of employment under this Agreement. Termination for “just cause” shall mean any of the following (and none of the following shall be interpreted as cumulative):

  


a. 

dishonesty as to a matter which is materially injurious to the Company;  
  
  


b. 

the commission of a willful act or omission intended or likely to materially injure the business of the Company;

8\. Voluntary Termination by Employee.

  


a. 

In the event Employee voluntarily terminates her employment with the Company, Employee will remain bound under the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 hereof, but will not be entitled to receive any compensation and benefits following her termination of employment except for any payments or benefits required by law.  
  
  


b. 

Voluntary termination means an intentional termination by the Employee without good reason and without pressure by the Company; and further, provided that there was not a material breach of this Agreement by the Company, prior to any such termination which remains uncured.  
  
  


9\. Cooperation with Change in Control. Employee will reasonably cooperate with the Company in the event of a Change in Control.

13\. Injunctive Relief; Attorneys’ Fees. In recognition of the irreparable harm that a violation by Employee of any of the covenants contained in either paragraphs 4 or 5 hereof would cause the Company, the Employee agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law, an injunction (both temporary and permanent) against such violation or violations may be issued against him or her and every other person and entity concerned thereby, it being the understanding of the parties that both damages and an injunction shall be proper modes of relief and are not to be considered alternative remedies. Employee consents to the issuance of such injunctive relief without the posting of a bond or other security.
