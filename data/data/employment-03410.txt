NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. Employment Duties.

3. Compensation. Ungerer shall be compensated as follows:

a. Salary. Ungerer shall receive an annual salary of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000). The Company agrees to review the salary on or before December 31, 2008, and thereafter at the end of each calendar year during the Term based upon Ungerer’s services and the financial results of the Company, and to make such changes as may be determined appropriate in the sole discretion of the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board of Directors. Ungerer’s annual salary shall be payable on a semi-monthly basis, in accordance with the Company’s usual payroll practices.

b. Bonus Compensation. During each calendar year in the Initial Term, Ungerer may become eligible to participate in the Company’s bonus programs based on performance objectives to be agreed to by Ungerer and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Any bonus earned by Ungerer in a particular calendar year will be paid by the Company in the manner and time period agreed to by the parties. The bonus shall be prorated should Ungerer’s employment terminate prior to a full calendar year.

c. Stock Options. The Company’s management will recommend to the Company’s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee that Ungerer be granted a stock option to purchase 30,000 shares of the Company’s capital stock at the next regularly scheduled quarterly meeting. If approved, the stock options would be granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and would be governed by the terms of an option agreement setting forth the vesting schedule of such shares (equal monthly installments over 48 months). If there is any conflict between this Agreement and the terms of the option agreement, the terms of the option agreement will control.

d. Paid Time-Off. Ungerer shall accrue paid time-off in accordance with the terms of the Company’s paid time-off policy. Ungerer shall be compensated at his usual rate of base compen­sation during any such paid time-off. Ungerer shall be entitled to paid holi­days as generally given by the Company and shall receive sick leave or disability leave in accordance with the terms of the Company’s standard sick leave or disability leave policy.

e. Benefits. Ungerer shall be entitled to participate in any group plans or programs maintained by the Company for any employees relating to group health, disability, life insurance and other related benefits as in effect from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of such plans. Ungerer shall also be entitled to director and officer insurance in such amounts and coverage and such indemnification provisions as are afforded other officers and directors of the Company. The foregoing benefits shall be paid by the Company.

f. Expenses. The Company shall reim­burse Ungerer for his normal and reasonable expenses incurred for travel, entertainment and similar items in promoting and carrying out the Company’s business in accordance with the Company’s general policy as adopted from time to time. In addition, Ungerer shall be reimbursed for the reasonable costs associated with cellular telephone usage and shall be entitled to reimbursement for such reasonable continuing professional education, memberships and certifications as are deemed normal and appropriate for executive officers as determined by the Company. As a condition of

payment or reimbursement, Ungerer agrees to provide the Company with copies of all available invoices and receipts, and otherwise account to the Company in sufficient detail to allow the Company to claim an income tax deduction for such paid item, if such item is deductible. Reimbursements shall be made on a monthly or more frequent basis in accordance with the Company’s reimbursement policies then in effect.

4. Confidentiality and Competitive Activities. Ungerer agrees to execute the Company’s current form of employee proprietary information and inventions agreement, which will include provisions related to confidentiality of Company information, assignment of inventions, non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees.

5. Termination.

a. Termination without Cause; Voluntary Termination. The Company may terminate this Agreement and Ungerer’s employment hereunder without Cause (as defined below) and with or without prior review or warning by providing 60 days prior written notice to Ungerer. Ungerer may volun­tarily terminate his employ­ment at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice to the Company.

b. Termination for Cause. The Company may immedi­ately terminate Ungerer’s employment at any time for Cause. Termin­ation for Cause shall be effective from the receipt of written notice thereof to Ungerer­ specifying the grounds for termination. “Cause” shall be deemed to include: (i) Ungerer’s willful misconduct, or failure to perform, his material duties provided that Ungerer is given written notice setting forth with reasonable specificity such misconduct or failure and Ungerer fails to correct such behavior within 30 days following receipt of notice; (ii) Ungerer’s conviction of a felony offense or conviction for any unlawful act which would be materially detrimental to the Company’s reputation, or a material act of dishonesty, moral turpitude, fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or financial dishonesty against the Company; or (iii) Ungerer’s breach of any material provision of this Agreement, including his obligations under Section 8(a), or breach of his employee proprietary information agreement. The Company’s exercise of its rights to terminate with Cause shall be without prejudice to any other remedies it may be entitled at law, in equity or under this Agreement.

c. Termination Upon Death or Disability. This Agree­ment shall automatic­ally terminate upon Ungerer’s death. In addition, if any disability or incapacity of Ungerer to perform his duties as the result of any injury, sickness, or physical, mental or emotional condition continues for a period of 30 days (excluding any accrued paid time-off) out of any 120 calendar day period, the Company may terminate Ungerer’s employ­ment upon written notice. Payment of salary to Ungerer during any sick leave shall only be to the extent that Ungerer has accrued paid time-off.

6. Severance Payment Upon Termination of Employment. The severance payment set forth below shall be in addition to any amounts owed to Ungerer as earned but unpaid wages through the date of termination and accrued but unused vacation through the date of termination.

a. Termination Without Cause. If the Company terminates this Agreement without Cause prior to the end of the Initial Term, the Company shall pay Ungerer a severance payment equal to six months of his annual salary (without bonus), payable over such period in accordance with the Company’s usual payroll practices. For the avoidance of doubt, the six months of severance provided for in this Section 6(a) shall include the 60 days of notice required by Section 5(a) regarding termination without Cause.

b. Execution of Release. Ungerer agrees that Ungerer’s right to receive any severance payment is conditioned on the prior execution by Ungerer of a binding general release (in such form as the Company may determine) of any and all claims against the Company and any affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees or other agents.

7. Compensation Upon a Change of Control.

a. Change of Control Termination. Upon a Change of Control Termination (as defined below), Ungerer shall be entitled to the following compensation:

(i) Cash Payment. In lieu of any severance payment described above in Section 6, payment in cash of an amount equal to the sum of one times Ungerer’s then current annual salary as in effect for the calendar year in which the Change of Control Termination occurs, payable in accordance with the Company’s usual payroll practices.

(ii) Stock Options. Any stock options granted to Ungerer that are outstanding immediately prior to but are not vested as of the date of the Change of Control Termination shall become 100% vested as of the date of the Change of Control Termination.

b. Offer of Employment with Successor. If upon a Change of Control Ungerer is offered employment by the Company’s successor with responsibilities substantially similar to that contemplated by this Agreement and Ungerer does not accept such offer, 33.3% of the stock options granted to Ungerer that are outstanding immediately prior to but are not vested as of the date of the Change of Control shall become vested as of the date of the Change of Control.

c. Employment with Successor. If upon a Change of Control Ungerer accepts employment with the Company’s successor with responsibilities substantially similar to that contemplated by this Agreement, 33.3% of the stock options granted to Ungerer that are outstanding immediately prior to but are not vested as of the date of the Change of Control shall become vested as of the date of the Change of Control. If Ungerer terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined below) with the Company’s successor on or after the 6-month anniversary of commencement of such employment, all remaining stock options granted to Ungerer that are outstanding immediately prior to but are not vested as of the date of his termination for Good Reason shall become vested as of the date of such termination.

(iv) approval by the Company’s stockholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company other than in the context of a transaction or series of related transactions that would not constitute a Change of Control under clause (iii) above.

b. No Implied Waivers. The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect in any way the right to require such per­form­ance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same provision or any other provision.

c. Personal Services. It is understood that the services to be performed by Ungerer hereunder are personal in nature and the obligations to perform such services and the conditions and covenants of this Agreement cannot be assigned by Ungerer.
