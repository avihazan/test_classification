## 

## (d) If Participant’s Service terminates due to involuntary termination by the Company with Cause, the Participant shall forfeit the vested and unvested portion of this Option on the date of such termination of Service.

## 

## (e) Subject to the Plan, this Option may be exercised by submitting to the Company: (i) written notice of exercise (in accordance with, and referencing, this Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise this Option, stating the whole number of Option Shares as to which this Option is being exercised, the manner of payment for the Option Shares, the name and address to which the share certificates are to be delivered with respect to the Option Shares granted upon exercise of the Option, and such other information as the Committee may require, and (ii) full payment for the Exercise Price of Option Shares with respect to which this Option is exercised and any withholding tax relating to the exercise of this Option.

## 

## (f) Full payment may consist of any of the following methods: (i) in cash, or its equivalent, in United States dollars; (ii) by tendering Shares owned by the Participant for at least six months and duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, (iii) Option Shares issuable to the Participant upon exercise of the Option, or (iv) any combination of cash, certified or cashier’s check and Shares. Shares issued upon exercise of this Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse.

The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after this Option is exercised.

If the Committee permits this Option to

3

* * *

  


## be transferable, the Committee may impose additional terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate.

## 

## (b) Notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth below in subsection (a) above, the Participant shall be permitted at all times to transfer any or all of this Option to certain trusts designated by the Participant as long as such transfer or issuance is made as a gift (i.e., a transfer for no consideration, with donative intent), whether during the Participant’s lifetime or to take effect upon (or as a consequence of) the Participant’s death, to the Participant’s spouse or children. Gifts in trust shall be deemed gifts to every beneficiary and contingent beneficiary, and so shall not be permitted under this Section if the beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries shall include anyone other than such spouse or children. Transfers to a spouse or child for consideration, regardless of the amount, shall not be permitted under this Section. Options transferred in accordance with this subsection (b) may be exercised by the transferee.

## 

# 7\. Adjustments

# 

## (a) The number of Option Shares subject to this Option shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been “effected without receipt of consideration.” Such adjustments shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.

## 

## (b) In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Committee shall notify Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Committee in its discretion may provide for Participant to have the right to exercise the vested portion of this Option until ten (10) days prior to such transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, this Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.

## 

## (c) In the event of Change in Control that is a merger, consolidation, or similar reorganization of the Company with any other entity pursuant to which the holders of Shares surrender Shares (or the Shares are deemed converted) in exchange for other shares of capital stock or securities of the Company or another entity, then an equitable adjustment shall be made in this Option and Participant’s Shares subject to the Plan. Such equitable adjustment may be (i) the substitution of the number and kind of shares of capital stock or other securities that the holders of Shares are entitled to receive for each Share surrendered pursuant to the transaction and/or the proportionate adjustment to the Exercise Price or (ii) any other adjustment that the Board determines to be equitable. Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.

## 

## (d) Except as provided in this Section 7, Participant shall have no rights by reason of (i) any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, (ii) the payment of any dividend or (iii) any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. Any issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into

4

* * *

  


## shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or Exercise Price of Shares subject to this Option. The grant of this Option shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.

## 

# 8\. Restrictive Covenants

# 

## (a) Nondisclosure and Nonuse of Trade Secrets.

## 

(b) Non-Competition. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that (i) in the course of the Participant’s Service the Participant shall become familiar with the Trade Secrets of the Company and its Affiliates, (ii) the Participant’s services to the Company and its Affiliates are unique in nature and of an extraordinary value to the Company and its Affiliates, and (iii) the Company and its Affiliates could be irreparably damaged if the Participant were to provide similar services to any person or entity competing with the Company or any Affiliate or engaged in a similar business.

(d) Judicial Modification. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 8 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that (i) the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, (ii) the parties shall request that the court exercise that power, and (iii) this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment or decision may be appealed.
