(v) pay to the Employee, not less frequently than monthly, the amount of any difference between the level of long-term disability benefits required to be maintained under the Benefit Plans (the “Maximum Monthly Benefit” as defined in the US Benefit Plan), and the amount actually paid in satisfaction of such benefits by insurance, for so long as the Employee remains disabled and therefore entitled to such benefits; 

(w) take actions necessary such that all Options or Shares granted to the Employee under the Plans which remain unvested shall immediately vest; 

(x) pay a pro rata bonus for the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs, based on the Average Incentive amount and the number of days elapsed in the current fiscal year as of the Date of Termination; and

* * *

![LOGO](g3430291201.jpg)

“Severance Period”) or, if shorter, until the Executive becomes entitled to participate in or receive coverage under health plans of a subsequent employer. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Executive’s employment is terminated pursuant to this subsection (c) of this Section 8, the Executive shall receive any payments to which he is entitled under subsection (f) of Section 6 (to the extent that subsection (f) of Section 6 is applicable) in addition to any payments and benefits to which he is entitled under this subsection (c) of this Section 8.

The payments and provision of benefits to the Executive required by Section 7 or subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 8 (other than the Accrued Benefits) shall be conditioned on the Executive’s delivery (and non-revocation prior to the expiration of the revocation period contained in the release) of such release.   
  
9. INDEMNIFICATION   
  
The Company shall indemnify the Executive (and his legal representatives or other successors and heirs) to the fullest extent permitted (including payment of expenses in advance of final disposition of the proceeding provided approved by the Board) by the laws of Connecticut, as in effect at the time of the subject act or omission; and the Executive shall be entitled to the protection of any insurance policies the Company may elect to maintain generally for the benefit of its directors and officers, against all costs, charges and expenses whatsoever incurred or sustained by him or his legal representatives in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which he (or his legal representatives or other successors and heirs) may be made a party by reason of his being or having been a director, officer or Executive of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made to the Executive for losses relating to any disgorgement remedy contemplated by Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. If any action, suit or proceeding is brought or threatened against the Executive in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company pursuant to the foregoing, the Executive shall notify the Company promptly in writing of the institution of such action, suit or proceeding and the Company shall assume the defense thereof and the employment of counsel and payment of all fees and expenses, provided, however, that if a conflict of interest exists between the Company and the Executive such that it is not legally practicable for the Company to assume the Executive’s defense, the Executive shall be entitled to retain separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company at the Company’s expense.

This clause shall remain in effect in perpetuity or until such confidential information is publicly disclosed by the Company or otherwise becomes publicly disclosed other than through the Executive’s actions.

In consideration of the benefits and entitlements provided by this Agreement, the Executive agrees that, during his employment hereunder and for the duration of the Severance Period (the period between the date of “Notice of Termination” and “Date of Termination”) he will not, other than on behalf of the Company, directly or indirectly, as a sole proprietor, agent, broker or intermediary, member of a partnership, or stockholder, investor, officer or director of a corporation, or as an employee, agent, associate or consultant of any person, firm or corporation:

The parties acknowledge and agree that the Executive’s breach or threatened breach of any of the restrictions set forth in Sections 11 and 12 will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company for which there may be no adequate remedy at law and that the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach or threatened or attempted breach. The Executive hereby consents to the grant of an injunction (temporary or otherwise) against the Executive or the entry of any other court order against the Executive prohibiting and enjoining him from violating, or directing him to comply with any provision of Sections 11 and 12. The Executive also agrees that such remedies shall be in addition to any and all

remedies, including damages, available to the Company against him for such breaches or threatened or attempted breaches. The Executive acknowledges that he has received good and valuable consideration for the obligations contained in Sections 11 and 12. Violation by the Executive of any of the restrictions contained in Sections 11 and 12 will give the Company the right to immediately terminate all future severance payments including any post termination exercise periods. 

13. PROPERTY   
  
The Executive acknowledges that all originals and copies of materials, records and documents generated by him or coming into his possession during the term of his employment hereunder are the sole property of the Company (“Company Property”).

Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Executive. 

19. MISCELLANEOUS   
  
(a)

The parties hereto agree that this Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between them, and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements   
  
* * *

![LOGO](g3430291201.jpg)

between the parties, including, without limitation, the Employment Agreement by and between the Executive effective January 1, 2009, respecting the provision of services by the Executive to the Company other than the provisions of any Plan or Benefit Plan or award or other instrument entered into hereunder.   
  
(b) The parties further agree that the provisions of this Agreement may not be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the parties hereto. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.   
  
(c) The form and timing of all payments under this Agreement shall be made in a manner which complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.   
  
(d) Except as set forth in the Plans, Equity Award Agreements or Benefit Plans, no agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.   
  
(e) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 9 or Section 14 hereof, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the Company and the Executive any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.   
  
20. SEVERABILITY AND JUDICIAL MODIFICATION   
  
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction to be enforceable only if modified, such holding shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, the balance of which shall continue to be binding upon the parties hereto with any such modification to become a part hereof and treated as though originally set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree that any such court or arbitration panel is expressly authorized to modify any such unenforceable provision of this Agreement in lieu of severing such unenforceable provision from this Agreement in its entirety, whether by rewriting the offending provision, deleting any or all of the offending provision, adding additional language to this Agreement, or by making such other modifications as it deems warranted to carry out the intent and agreement of the parties as embodied herein to the maximum extent permitted by law. The parties expressly agree that this Agreement as so modified by the court or arbitration panel shall be binding upon and enforceable against each of them. In any event, should one or more of the provisions of this Agreement be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and if such provision or provisions are not modified as provided above, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been set forth herein.

21. COUNTERPARTS   
  
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

22. CHANGE OF CONTROL   
  
The terms of the Change in Control Policy (the “CIC Policy”) as approved by the Compensation Committee and any amendment thereto, shall apply to the Executive. The CIC Policy shall be incorporated in this Agreement and shall be binding on the Executive as if such CIC Policy were contained herein verbatim. 

23. SECTION 409A   
  
It is intended that the provisions of this Agreement comply with Section 409A and the Treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject the Executive to the payment of interest and tax penalty which may be imposed under Section 409A. In furtherance of this objective, to the extent that any regulations or other guidance issued under Section 409A would result in the Executive being subject to payment of “additional tax” under Section 409A, the parties agree to use their best efforts to amend this Agreement in order to avoid the imposition of any such “additional tax” under Section 409A, which such amendment shall be designed to minimize the adverse economic effect on the Executive without increasing the cost to the Company (other than transactions costs), all as reasonably determined in good faith by the Company and the Executive to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provisions. This Section 23 does not guarantee that payments under this Agreement will not be subject to “additional tax” under Section 409A.
