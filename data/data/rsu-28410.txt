In that event the Participant may exercise the Option or Options during the remainder of the period preceding the Expiration Date or until the date that is three months after the date he ceases to serve on the Board, whichever is shorter.

6.06 Minimum Exercise.

  


An Option granted under this Plan may not be exercised for less than fifty shares of Common Stock unless it is exercised for the full number of shares that remain subject to the Option.

The Company shall credit to a Participant’s Deferral Account within thirty (30) days after the payment date of any cash dividend with respect to shares of the Company’s Common Stock, that number of additional Deferred Stock Units determined by dividing (a) the product of the total number of Deferred Stock Units credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account as of the record date for such dividend multiplied by the per share amount of the dividend by (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such record date. All Deferred Stock Units credited to a Participant’s Deferral Account in accordance with this Section 7.03 shall be fully vested in such Participant.

  


7.04 Distribution of Deferral Accounts. A Participant’s Deferral Account shall be paid to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant’s death, to the Participant’s estate, as soon as practicable following the date the Participant terminates service as a member of the Board.

Distribution of the Participant’s Deferral Account shall be made in a single sum payment of shares of Company Common Stock and cash for any fractional unit credited to the Deferral Account.

ARTICLE VIII

GENERAL

  


8.01 Nontransferability.

  


Except as provided in Section 8.02, each Option or Deferred Stock Unit granted under this Plan shall be nontransferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as provided in Section 8.02, during the lifetime of the Participant to whom an Option is granted, the Option may be exercised only by the Participant. No right or interest of a Participant in any Option or Deferred Stock Unit shall be liable for, or subject to, any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant.

  


8.02 Limited Transferability.

  


Section 8.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, an Option or Deferred Stock Unit may be transferred by a Participant to the Participant’s children, grandchildren, spouse, one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members or a partnership in which such family members are the only partners, on such terms and conditions as may be permitted under Securities Exchange Commission Rule 16b-3 as in effect from time to time. The holder of an Option or Deferred Stock Unit transferred pursuant to this section shall be bound by the same terms and conditions that governed the Option or Deferred Stock Unit during the period that it was held by the Participant; provided, however, that such transferee may not transfer the Option or Deferred Stock Unit except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

  


9

* * *

8.03 Status.

  


The Board may decide to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary disability, or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous service on the Board for purposes of this Plan.

  


8.04 Shareholder Rights.

  


No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to shares subject to an Option or Deferred Stock Unit until the date of exercise of such Option or the date the Participant receives shares of Common Stock in payment of the Deferred Stock Units credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account under the Plan.

  


  


ARTICLE IX

  


INDEMNIFICATION

  


A Participant shall be entitled to a payment under this Article IX if (i) any benefit, payment, accelerated vesting or other right under this Plan constitutes a “parachute payment” (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A), but without regard to Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii)), with respect to such Participant and (ii) the Participant incurs a liability under Code Section 4999. The amount payable to a Participant described in the preceding sentence shall be the amount required to indemnify the Participant and hold the Participant harmless from the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999. To effect this indemnification, the Company shall pay such Participant an amount sufficient to pay the excise tax imposed on Participant under Code section 4999 with respect to benefits, payments, accelerated vesting and other rights under this Plan and any other plan or agreement and any income, self-employment, hospitalization, excise or other taxes attributable to the indemnification payment. The benefit payable under this Article IX shall be paid in a single cash sum not later than twenty days after the date (or extended filing date) on which the tax return reflecting liability for the Code Section 4999 excise tax is required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the terms of any other plan or agreement also require that a Participant be indemnified and held harmless from the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999, any such indemnification and the amount required to be paid to a Participant under this Article XI shall be coordinated so that such indemnification is paid only once, and the Company’s obligation under this Article XI shall be satisfied to the extent of any such other payment.

ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGE IN COMMON STOCK

  


The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Plan, and the number of shares as to which Options and Deferred Stock Units may be granted under this Plan as of the applicable Award Date, and the terms of outstanding Options and Deferred Stock Units shall be adjusted as the Board shall determine to be equitably required in the event that (a) the Company (i) effects one or more stock dividends, stock split-ups, subdivisions or consolidations of shares or (ii) engages in a transaction to which Section 424 of the Code applies or (b) there occurs any other event which, in the judgment of the Board necessitates such action. Any determination made under this Article X by the Board shall be final and conclusive.

  


The issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the maximum number of shares as to which Options and Deferred Stock Units may be granted or the terms of outstanding Options and Deferred Stock Units.

  


  


ARTICLE XI

  


COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND APPROVAL OF REGULATORY BODIES

The Company shall have the right to rely on an opinion of its counsel as to such compliance. Any share certificate issued to evidence Common Stock when an Option is exercised or when a Deferred Stock Unit is converted to Common Stock may bear such legends and statements as the Board may deem advisable to assure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. No Option shall be exercisable, no Common Stock shall be issued, and no certificate for shares shall be delivered under this Plan until the Company has obtained such consent or approval as the Board may deem advisable from regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such matters.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Neither the adoption of this Plan, its operation, nor any documents describing or referring to this Plan (or any part thereof), shall confer upon any individual any right to continue in the service of the Company or in any way affect any right and power of the Company to terminate the service of any individual at any time with or without assigning a reason therefor.

  


12.02 Unfunded Plan.

  


The Plan, insofar as it provides for grants, shall be unfunded, and the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by grants under this Plan. Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to any grant under this Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created pursuant to this Plan.

12.03 Rules of Construction.

  


Headings are given to the articles and sections of this Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. The reference to any statute, regulation, or other provision of law shall be construed to refer to any amendment to or successor of such provision of law.

AMENDMENT

No amendment shall, without a Participant’s consent, adversely affect any rights of such Participant under any Option or Deferred Stock Unit outstanding at the time such amendment is made. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Board may amend or modify the Plan to the extent necessary to cause the Plan to comply with the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004) and any rules or regulations issued thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury.
