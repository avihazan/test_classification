Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to purchase any shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion, determine, whether or not less consideration could be paid upon the purchase of the same number of shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by law.

  


FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:

  


(a) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

  


(b) The number of directors of the Corporation initially shall be nine, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased by, or in the manner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation, provided, that the number of directors shall never be less than three nor more than fifteen.

  


(c) The directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of common stock or Preferred Stock, shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. The term of the initial Class I directors shall expire on the date of the 1998 annual meeting; the term of the initial Class II directors shall expire on the date of the 1999 annual meeting; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall expire on the date of the 2000 annual meeting. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 1998, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected by a plurality vote of all shares cast at such meeting to hold office for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible.

  


The following persons shall serve as Class I directors until the 1998 annual meeting of stockholders:

  


Robert C. Spoerri

Charles K. Esler

Daniel W. Cummings

* * *

  


  


  


(f) Subject to the terms of any one or more other classes or series of common stock or Preferred Stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the entire Board of Directors and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from the removal of a director may also be filled by the stockholders. Any director of any class elected by the stockholders to fill a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director of such class shall serve for the balance of the term of the removed director. Any director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualifies. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or shares of any other class or series of common stock then outstanding, any director of the Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause (as such term would be construed under Section 2-406(a) of the MGCL, or any successor provision) and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock or one or more other classes or series of common stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Charter applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article FIFTH unless expressly provided by such terms.

SIXTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL or Maryland decisional law, as amended, supplemented or interpreted, no director or officer shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages. Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

  


SEVENTH: The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL or Maryland decisional law, as amended, supplemented or interpreted, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article SEVENTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

  


The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article SEVENTH to directors and officers of the Corporation.

  


The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Charter, the Bylaws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  


Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

  


EIGHTH: Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected: (i) at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation or (ii) by written consent if there is filed with the records of stockholders meetings a unanimous written consent which sets forth the action and is signed by each stockholder entitled to vote on the matter and a written waiver of any right to dissent signed by each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting but not entitled to vote thereat.
