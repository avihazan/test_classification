Exhibit 10.5 

TRIMBLE NAVIGATION LIMITED 



RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 

(U.S. AWARDEES) 

Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement shall have the same defined meanings as set forth in the Trimble Navigation Limited Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan (the “Plan”). 

Name: 

Address: 

You have been awarded the right to receive Common Stock of the Company or a cash equivalent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, as follows:   
  
Award Number  
  
Award Date  
  
Total Number of Restricted Stock Units Awarded   
  
Vesting Schedule 

One hundred percent (100%) of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award shall vest thirty-six (36) months after the Award Date. Vesting of Restricted Stock Units shall at all times be subject to your continuing to be a Service Provider on the applicable date(s) of vesting. Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that you cease to be a Service Provider as a result of your death, the Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested with respect to the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested had you continued as a Service Provider for an additional twenty-four (24) month period following the date of your death. 

Settlement 

For each vested Restricted Stock Unit, you shall be entitled to receive (a) a number of whole Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units vesting on such vesting date, or (b) a cash payment equal to the product of the number of Restricted Stock Units vesting on such vesting date and the Fair Market Value of one Share on such vesting date or (c) a combination of the foregoing. Such payment shall be made in the form of whole Shares, cash or a combination of the foregoing at the Company’s discretion under the terms of the Plan, on or as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, following the date of vesting. 

* * *

Forfeiture 

Except as provided above under the heading “Vesting Schedule,” upon the date that you cease to be a Service Provider, for any reason, all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. The date of ceasing to be a Service Provider will not be extended to include any notice of termination or similar period and shall be considered ceased on the last active day of service for the purposes of the Plan. 

Tax Obligations 

Regardless of any action the Company and/or your actual employer, if the Company is not your employer (collectively, the “Company”), takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company. You further acknowledge that the Company (1) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (2) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company, or its agents, at its discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: 

(a)

withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company; or   
  
(b)

withholding from proceeds of the sale of the Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); or   
  
(c)

withholding in Shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement or from the cash payment received at settlement (if any) of the Restricted Stock Units.

* * *

To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. 

Finally, you shall pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares, any cash payments receivable at settlement or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 

NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED SERVICE 

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF YOUR EMPLOYER (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING AWARDED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RECEIVING CASH OR SHARES HEREUNDER). YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR RIGHT OR YOUR EMPLOYER’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW. 

Nature of Grant 

In accepting the grant, you acknowledge that: 

(1) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; 

(2) the grant of the Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; 

(3) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Units grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

(4) your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further employment with the Company or any Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company or an Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate your Service Provider relationship at any time; 

(5) you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 

(6) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or any Affiliate, and which is outside the scope of your employment contract, if any; 

(7) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 

(8) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or any Affiliate; 

(9) the Restricted Stock Units grant and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company or an Affiliate; 

(10) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; 

(11) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from termination of your employment with the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws), and, in consideration of the grant, to which you otherwise are not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company and your actual employer, if the Company is not your employer, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and your actual employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and 

(12) in the event of termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right, if any, to vest in the Restricted Stock Units under the Plan will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; the Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of your Restricted Stock Units grant.
