NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


1\. Employment. Company hereby employs Executive and Executive hereby accepts employment with Company upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

  


2\. Duties. Subject to the power of the Board of Directors of Company to elect and remove officers, Executive will serve the Company as its Chief Executive Officer and President and will faithfully and diligently perform the services and functions relating to such office or otherwise reasonably incident to such office, provided that all such services and functions will be reasonable and within Executive’s area of expertise. Executive will, during the term of this Agreement (or any extension thereof), devote his time, attention and skills and best efforts to the promotion of the business of Company. The foregoing will not be construed as preventing Executive from being employed by or making investments in other businesses or enterprises provided that (a) Executive agrees not to become engaged in any other business activity that interferes with his ability to discharge his duties and responsibilities to Company and (b) Executive does not violate any other provision of this Agreement.

  


3\. Term. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the term of employment of Executive commences on September 18, 2014 (the “Commencement Date”) and will end on September 18, 2017, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the terms hereof. The term of this Agreement is referred to herein as the “Term.”

4\. Compensation and Benefits During the Employment Term.

(c)

Expenses. Upon submission of a detailed statement and reasonable documentation, the Company will reimburse Executive in the same manner as other executive officers for all reasonable and necessary or appropriate out-of-pocket travel and other expenses incurred by Executive in rendering services required under this Agreement.  
  
  


5\. Confidentiality, Intellectual Property and Non-Competition.

  


(a)

Confidentiality. In the course of the performance of Executive’s duties hereunder, Executive recognizes and acknowledges that Executive may have access to certain confidential and proprietary information of Company or any of its affiliates. Without the prior written consent of Company, Executive shall not disclose any such confidential or proprietary information to any person or firm, corporation, association, or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, and shall not use such information, directly or indirectly, for Executive’s own behalf or on behalf of any other party. Executive agrees and affirms that all such information is the sole property of Company and that at the termination and/or expiration of this Agreement, at Company’s written request, Executive shall promptly return to Company any and all such information so requested by Company.  
  
  


Information acquired in the course of employment, including confidential, secret or proprietary information, is the sole property of the Company, and Executive may not use such information for his individual benefit during such employment, or after such employment with the Company has ceased. Access to confidential information does not carry with it personal benefit or advantage but imposes an obligation to keep such information confidential and to use it solely in the interest of the Company.  
  
  


The provisions of this Section 5 shall not, however, prohibit Executive from disclosing to others or using in any manner information that:

  


(i)

has been published or has become part of the public domain other than by acts, omissions or fault of Executive;  
  
  


(ii)

has been furnished or made known to Executive by third parties (other than those acting directly or indirectly for or on behalf of Executive) as a matter of legal right without restriction on its use or disclosure;  
  
  


(iii)

was in the possession of Executive prior to obtaining such information from Company in connection with the performance of this Agreement; or  
  
  


(iv)

is required to be disclosed by law.  
  
(b)

Non-Competition. Executive agrees that he will not, for himself, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, firm, corporation or entity, either as principal, employee, shareholder, member, director, partner, consultant, owner or part owner of any corporation, partnership or any other type of business entity, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, participate in, or be connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation, or control of any business similar to or competitive with the business presently conducted by the Company of delivering turnkey solutions to spine surgeons and orthopedic surgeons for necessary and appropriate treatment for musculo-skeletal spine injuries, anywhere in the United States for a period of one years (the “Non-Compete Period”) from the termination of this Agreement. However, in the event of the termination of Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 7(d) or 7(f), the Non-Compete Period shall be six months.

Executive agrees not to hire, solicit or attempt to solicit for employment by Executive or any company to which he may be involved, either directly or indirectly, any party who is an employee or independent contractor of the Company or any entity which is affiliated with the Company, or any person who was an employee or independent contractor of the Company or any entity which is affiliated with the Company during the Non-Compete Period.

  


Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all provisions of this Agreement and agrees that:

  


(i)

Due to the nature of the Company’s business, the foregoing covenants place no greater restraint upon Executive than is reasonably necessary to protect the business and goodwill of the Company;  
  
  


(ii)

These covenants protect the legitimate interests of the Company and do not serve solely to limit the Company’s future competition;  
  
(iii)

This Agreement is not an invalid or unreasonable restraint of trade;  
  
(iv)

A breach of these covenants by Executive would cause irreparable damage to the Company;  
  
  


(v)

These covenants are reasonable in scope and are reasonably necessary to protect the Company’s business and goodwill which the Company has established through its own expense and effort; and  
  
(vi)

The signing of this Agreement is necessary as part of the consummation of the transactions described in the preamble.  
  
(c)

Work Product. All work product of Executive is the sole property of the Company. Work product of Executive includes but is not limited to any and all discoveries, inventions, ideas, concepts, research, information, processes, software development, products, techniques, methods and improvements or parts thereof conceived, developed, or otherwise made by Executive alone or jointly with others during the period of his employment with the Company, and in any way relating to the present or proposed products, services and/or operations of the Company, whether or not patentable or subject to copyright or trademark protection, whether or not made during Executive’s regular working hours, and whether or not made on the Company premise.

(b)

Death. This Agreement will terminate on the Death of the Executive.

(d)

Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment for “Good Reason” if:  
  
  


(i)

he is assigned, without his express written consent, any duties materially inconsistent with his positions, duties, responsibilities, or status with the Company as of the date hereof, or a change in his reporting responsibilities or titles as in effect as of the date hereof; provided, however, that Executive must provide the Company with written notice of his dispute of such re-assignment of duties or change in his reporting responsibilities under this Section 7(d)(i) and give the Company opportunity to cure such inconsistency.
