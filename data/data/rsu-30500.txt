Subject to the requirements of subsection (b) below, vested Shares may be exercised after the applicable Vesting Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any portion of the Option that has not vested or been forfeited previously shall immediately vest in full upon, and, subject to subsection (b) below, may be exercised in whole or in part after, (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control that occurs while you are employed by or otherwise providing service to the Company or one of its subsidiaries, or (2) your death, Disability, or Retirement. 

(b) Except as provided below, the vested Option must be exercised by you, if at all, while you are providing service to the Company or one of its subsidiaries or within three months following your Termination Date, but in no event after  (the “Expiration Date”). If your Termination Date occurs by reason of your Retirement, death or Disability, the Option may thereafter be exercised by you, or in the event of your death, by your estate or your designated beneficiary, or in the event of your Disability, by you or your legal representative, at any time prior to the Expiration Date. If you die after your Termination Date and during the period in which the Option is exercisable, the right to exercise the Option during such period will be governed by Plan Section 11(d).

Any portion of the Option that is not vested pursuant to this Section 1.2 as of your employment Termination Date will be forfeited immediately. If the Option is not exercised as to all of the vested shares covered by the Option within the applicable time period and in the manner provided herein, the Option will terminate and will not be exercisable thereafter. In no event may the Option be exercised after the Expiration Date. 

1.3 Method of Exercise.

(c) The notice must be signed by the person or persons entitled to exercise the Option and, if the Option is being exercised by any person or persons other than you, be accompanied by proof, satisfactory to the Committee, of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.

SECTION 2 

Section 102 Plan and Trust 

The Company has established a Plan and Trust (the “Section 102 Program”) that is intended to provide the Employee with the ability to obtain certain tax treatment under Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Ordinance (New Version), 1961 as amended from time to time and the rules and regulation promulgated thereunder (“Section 102”) with respect to the Option awarded under this Agreement. The Option is intended to qualify as an Approved 102 Award designated as a Capital Gain Award within the meaning of the Section 102 Program. The following additional rules shall apply to the Option: 

(a) The shares underlying the Option grant have been deposited in a Trust. Tamir Fishman 2004 Ltd., or its duly appointed successor, shall be the Trustee of the Trust. All fees and commissions relating to the sale, transfer or release of shares from the Trust shall be paid by the Employee. 

(b) To obtain Section 102 tax treatment, the Employee shall not sell or release from the Trust any shares subject to the Option until the lapse of the minimum required holding period under Section 102 (“Holding Period”). If any such sale or release occurs during the Holding Period, the sanctions under Section 102 and under any rules or regulation or orders or procedures promulgated thereunder shall apply to and shall be borne by such Employee. 

(c) Prior to any distribution or release of shares from the Trust, the Employee shall be required to remit to the Trustee funds sufficient to cover applicable withholding taxes, plus any commissions and fees relating to the sale or release of shares. Alternatively, the Employee may request that the Trustee sell sufficient shares to cover applicable withholding taxes, plus any commissions and fees relating to the sale or release. The Employee may request that shares in excess of any shares sold to cover withholding taxes, fees and commissions be transferred to the Employee, or the Employee may advise the Trustee to sell such shares and transfer the net proceeds to the Employee. 

(d) The Employee may exercise any vested portion of the Option prior to the end of the Holding Period, provided, however, if such exercise causes any shares to be distributed or released from the Trust the sanctions under Section 102 shall apply and shall be borne by the Employee, as described in this Section 4.

(e) By execution of this Agreement, the Employee hereby acknowledges that the Employee is familiar with the provisions of Section 102 and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, including without limitation the type of Approved 102 Awards granted to the Employee and the tax implications applicable to such awards. The Employee accepts the provisions of the Trust agreement signed between the Company and Trustee, and agrees to be bound by its terms.

ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE AND ARE MADE A PART OF THIS AGREEMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF EACH AND EVERY SUCH PROVISION WERE FULLY WRITTEN INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or combination of shares, merger, sale of assets or similar event, the number and kind of shares subject to Award under this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted in an equitable manner to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to or available for you.
