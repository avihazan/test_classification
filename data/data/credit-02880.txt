Section 2.2 Loan Conversion. Borrower and Administrative Agent agree that the Loan Conversion shall be deemed to have occurred effective June 1, 2008. The Conversion Date shall be June 1, 2008. This Amendment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement for a Conversion Notice. 

Section 2.3 Advance of Loan Proceeds. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that all conditions for a final Advance of the Loan proceeds have not been satisfied. Nevertheless, Borrower and Administrative Agent agree that the Commitment amount as of the date of this Amendment that has not previously been Advanced is $2,696,070 and shall be Advanced upon execution of this Amendment by all parties into a Special Account at City Bank, Levelland, Texas (“Special Account Depository”) to be held and disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Amendment. Such Special Account and the funds therein (collectively, the “Disbursement Account”) shall be Collateral. Borrower shall execute and shall cause to be executed from time to time such documents as Administrative Agent may request to assure the Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ rights in and perfection as a first priority security interest (in favor of Administrative Agent) against the Disbursement Account, and shall comply with all other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents related to such Collateral. Borrower shall execute, and shall cause the Special Account Depository to execute, a control agreement (the “Control Agreement”) in favor of Administrative Agent and in form and substance acceptable to Administrative Agent affirming Administrative Agent’s first lien security interest in and to the Disbursement Account, agreeing to the terms of this Amendment and Administrative Agent’s rights under the Loan Documents with respect to the Disbursement Account, and containing such additional provisions as Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 

Section 2.4 Terms and Disbursement of Disbursement Account. Borrower shall not have the right for Borrower to make withdrawals of any funds from the Disbursement Account or to amend or terminate the Disbursement Account. Disbursements of funds in the Disbursement Account can only be made by Administrative Agent consistent with this Amendment. Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control of and the right to amend the Disbursement Account. The funds, and all earnings from the funds, in the Disbursement Account shall be owned by Borrower unless Administrative Agent exercises its security interest rights to obtain the funds in the Disbursement Account. For Borrower to receive a disbursement of any funds in the Disbursement Account, Borrower must comply with all covenants and conditions in the Loan Agreement related to Borrower obtaining an Advance of Loan proceeds in the same manner as if the funds in the Disbursement Account were the last, remaining unadvanced Loan proceeds. 

Section 2.5 Section 2.5 of the Loan Agreement. The conditions set forth in Section 2.5(b) of the Loan Agreement are hereby deleted; provided this shall not be construed that each such condition was satisfied.
