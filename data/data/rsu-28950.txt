STOCK OPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

(FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS) 

This document sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to a stock option granted to Optionee under the SUPERVALU INC. 2002 Stock Plan, as evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement entered into between the Company and Optionee (the “Agreement”). Capitalized terms that appear in this document but are not defined herein, shall have the meanings given to them in the Plan or the Agreement. 

1\. Duration and Exercisability. The term of the Option shall be for a period of ten years from the Grant Date, terminating at the close of business on the Expiration Date set forth in the Agreement or such shorter period as is prescribed in paragraph 6 hereof. 

The Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to One Hundred Percent (100%) of the Shares subject thereto as of the Grant Date. The Option may be exercised at any time, or from time to time, as to any or all Shares. Optionee shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to the Option until such Shares are issued to Optionee upon exercise of the Option. 

2\. Manner of Exercise. The Option may be exercised by delivering a “Notice of Exercise of Stock Option” (the “Notice”) to the Company at its principal office, attention: Corporate Secretary. The Notice shall state the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised and shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for such Shares (determined by multiplying the Exercise Price by the number of Shares to be purchased). In the event the Option shall be exercised pursuant to paragraph 6(b) hereof by any person other than Optionee, the Notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of such person’s right to exercise the Option. 

3\. Delivery of Shares. As soon as practicable after the Notice is received, the Company shall issue and deliver (a) in the form of a stock certificate registered in Optionee’s name or Optionee’s name and the name of another adult person (21 years of age or older) as joint tenants, and mailed to Optionee’s address; or (b) In “book entry” form, i.e. registered with the Company’s stock transfer agent, in Optionee’s name or Optionee’s name and the name of another adult person (21 years of age or older) as joint tenants, and sent by electronic delivery to Optionee’s brokerage account. The Optionee shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to the Option until such Shares are purchased by Optionee upon exercise of the Option. 

4\. Withholding Taxes. In order to comply with all applicable income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to insure that, if necessary, all applicable federal or state payroll, withholding, income or other taxes are withheld or collected from Optionee. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, Optionee may elect to satisfy Optionee’s federal and state income tax withholding obligations upon exercise of the Option by (a) remitting cash or its equivalent payable to the Company, (b) having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise of the Option having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of federal and state income tax required to be withheld upon such exercise or (c) delivering Shares to the Company, other than the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option, having a Fair Market Value equal to such taxes. In addition to the amounts required to be withheld to pay applicable taxes, Optionee may elect to deliver Shares to the Company, other than Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option, that have been held by Optionee for a minimum of six months that have a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such additional federal and/or state income taxes imposed on Optionee in connection with the exercise of the Option. 

5\. Transferability. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, the Option shall not otherwise be transferable than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Option may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the Option may not be assigned, transferred (except as aforesaid), pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition of the Option contrary to the provisions hereof and the levy of an execution, attachment or similar process upon the Option shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Optionee may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise the rights of Optionee with respect to the Option upon the death of Optionee.

(b) In the event of the death of Optionee the Option may be exercised by Optionee or a legatee or legatees of Optionee under Optionee’s last will or by Optionee’s personal representatives or distributees at any time, but not after the Expiration Date, to the full extent of the Shares covered by the Option not previously purchased. 

(c) Nothing contained herein shall confer on the Optionee any right to continue as a director of the Company or affect in any way the right of the stockholders of the Company to remove the Optionee as a non-employee director of the Company, as provided in the Company’s ByLaws. 

7. Anti-dilution Adjustments.
