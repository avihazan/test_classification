# 2\. Transfer of Shares. Unless permitted by the Administrator, Unvested Shares or any interest or right therein or part thereof shall not be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Employee or his or her successors in interest and shall not be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect; provided, however, that this Section 2 shall not apply to vested Shares and shall not prevent transfers by will or by applicable laws of descent and distribution. In the case of a permitted transfer of Unvested Shares, the transferee or other recipient shall receive and hold the Unvested Shares so transferred subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms of this Section. Any transferee shall acknowledge the same by signing a copy of this Agreement. Transfer or sale of the Shares is subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by any applicable state and federal securities laws. The Unvested Shares will be held in book entry form by the Company’s Stock Transfer Agent, The Bank of New York. As Shares vest annually, the Transfer Agent will be given instructions to issue a certificate to the Employee for the vested Shares.

# 

# 3\. Change in Control Adjustment. In addition to the actions permitted under Section 11.3 of the Plan upon a Change in Control the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide that the Unvested Shares be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation or other entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering cash or the stock or other equity interests of the successor or survivor corporation or other entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares or cash payment rights.

# 

# 4\. Dividends and Voting Rights. Employee shall be entitled to any and all distributions on the Shares, payable from the Effective Date. Employee shall have all voting rights with respect to Shares.

# 

# 5\. Ownership Rights, Duties. This Agreement shall not affect in any way the ownership, voting rights or other rights or duties of Employee, except as specifically provided herein.

* * *

  


# 6\. Legends. The certificate evidencing the Shares issued shall be endorsed with any legend required under applicable federal and state securities laws and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation.

# 

# 7\. Adjustment for Stock Splits, Etc. All references to the number of Shares in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization or change in the Shares which may be made by the Company after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the Plan. Any and all shares of Common Stock received by the Employee with respect to such Shares as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization shall also be subject to this Agreement.

# 

# 8\. Notices. Notices required hereunder shall be given in person or by registered mail to the address of the Employee shown on the records of the Company, and to the Company at its principal executive office.

# 

# 9\. Survival of Terms. This Agreement shall apply to and bind Employee and the Company and their respective permitted assignees and transferees, heirs, legatees, executors, administrators and legal successors, including without limitation the Company’s acquirer in a Change in Control.

# 

# 10\. Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to require payment in cash or deduction from other compensation payable to the Employee of any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the issuance, lapsing of restrictions on or exercise of the Shares. The Company may, in its discretion, allow the Employee to deliver shares of Common Stock owned by the Employee duly endorsed for transfer to the Company with an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the statutory minimum sums to be withheld. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any new certificate representing vested Shares to the Employee or his or her legal representative unless and until the Employee or his or her legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state and local taxes applicable to the taxable income of the Employee resulting from the grant of the Shares or their vesting.

# 

# 11\. No Section 83(b) Elections. Because such election could have an impact on the Company’s ability to continue as a real estate investment trust under the Code (defined below), Employee agrees that Employee will not file an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), with respect to the Shares. If Employee does file a Section 83(b) election then such election shall cause the forfeiture of all of the Shares, without proration (notwithstanding Section 1(a)).

# 

# 12\. Representations. Employee has reviewed with his or her own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Employee is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. Employee understands that he/she (and not the Company) shall be responsible for his/her own tax liability that may arise as a result of the grant of Shares or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

# 13\. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with California law, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

# 

Employee represents that he/she has read this Agreement and is familiar with its terms and provisions. Employee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Company’s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee thereof upon any questions arising under this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement is deemed made as of the date first set forth above.
