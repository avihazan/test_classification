Subject to the foregoing limitations, the number of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Code of Regulations of the Corporation. In the event that the total number of Directors is not divisible by three, an extra Director shall be assigned to Class I if there is one extra Director to be assigned among the classes, and an extra director shall be assigned to each of Classes I and II if there are two extra Directors to be assigned among the classes.

(c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article, each Director shall serve until his successor is elected and qualified or until his prior death, retirement, resignation or removal. All of the Directors or all or the Directors of a particular class or any individual Director may be removed from office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors.

A Director so elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the present term of office of the class to which he or she was elected.

ARTICLE IX 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 

(a) Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, any Director or officer who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereafter, a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for-profit, a limited liability company, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction (including any actual or alleged error, misstatement or misleading statement) of such person while acting in an official capacity as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Subsection (d) of this Article IX, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

(b) Indemnification of Employees and Agents. To the extent that an employee or agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsection (a) of this Article IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in the action, suit or proceeding. Any further indemnification of employees and agents shall occur only if and to the extent that the Directors may, in their discretion, so determine. 

* * *

(c) Advancement of Expenses. Expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by a Director or officer of the Corporation in defending any proceeding referred to in Subsection (a) of this Article IX, shall be paid by the Corporation, in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or officer to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX; which undertaking may be secured or unsecured, at the discretion of the Corporation. 

(d) Procedures and Presumptions Under This Article. If a claim under Subsection (a) of this Article IX is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Ohio General Corporation Laws for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its Shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Ohio General Corporation Laws, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its Shareholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

(e) Indemnification Provided In This Article Not Exclusive. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, these Articles of Incorporation, the Code of Regulations, any agreement, any vote of Shareholders or any vote of disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 

(f) Contractual Obligation. This Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Director or officer of the Corporation, each individual who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, a limited liability corporation, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article IX is in effect, and any repeal, amendment or other modification of this Article IX shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. 

* * *

(g) Savings Clause. If this Article IX or any portion thereof shall be invalidated or found unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article IX that shall not have been invalidated or found unenforceable, or by any other applicable law. 

(h) Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and on behalf of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or individual serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, member, manager or agent of another corporation, a limited liability corporation, or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Ohio General Corporation Laws. 

ARTICLE X 

Notwithstanding any provisions of the laws of the State of Ohio now or hereafter in force requiring for any action the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a designated proportion (but less than all) of the voting power of the Corporation or of any class or classes of shares thereof, such action may be taken by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Corporation or of such class or classes, except that the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Corporation or of such class or classes shall be necessary to adopt any amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation and except that no amendment of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be effective to amend, alter, repeal or change the effect of any of the provisions of Articles V, VII, VIII, IX, X or XI hereof unless such amendment shall receive the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent of the outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon and at least a majority of the Common Shares entitled to vote thereon held by shareholders none of whom is as of the record date fixed for such vote, a Related Person, affiliate of a Related Person, or an associate of a Related Person; provided, however, that such voting requirement shall not be applicable to the approval of such an amendment if such amendment shall have been proposed and authorized by action of a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Corporation.
