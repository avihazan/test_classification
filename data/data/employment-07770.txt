EXHIBIT A

  


EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY

AND

INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

This Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into this 2nd day of July, 2009 and is by and between Blindspot Alert, Inc. (the “Company”), and Travis Bond (the “Employee”).

  


In consideration of my employment or continued employment by the Company, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged. The parties agree as follows:

  


1\. Employee Acknowledgement. Employee understand that the purpose of this Agreement is to make clear that Employee will (a) maintain the confidentiality of Company’s trade secrets; (b) that Employee will use the Company’s trade secrets for the exclusive benefit of the Company; (c) any inventions that Employee creates will be owned by the Company; (d) any prior or continuing activities that Employee had or has, will be kept separate from the Company and they will not conflict with the Company’s development of its proprietary rights; and (e) when and if Employee’s employment terminates with the Company, Employee will not use Employee’s prior position with the Company to the detriment of the Company.

  


2\. Protection of the Company’s Confidential Information.

  


a. Confidential Information. The Company continually obtains, develops, compiles and owns certain proprietary and confidential information that has great value in its business (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes all information which is not generally known to the Company’s competitors and the public, and which has or could have commercial value to the Company’s business. It includes not only information disclosed by the Company (or its customers, affiliates or vendors) to Employee during the course of Employee’s employment with the Company, but also information developed or learned by the Employee during the course of Employee’s employment with the Company, such as Inventions, as defined below. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of information: information regarding the Company’s technology, computer programs, computer codes, products, product specifications, techniques, inventions, discoveries, improvements, methods, research, test results, or know-how; information regarding the Company’s customers’ and vendors’ identities, characteristics, performance and agreements; information regarding the Company’s affiliates’, sub-affiliates’ and employees’ characteristics, performances and agreements; and information regarding the Company’s marketing, multilevel marketing business sales and business plans, strategies, forecasts, unpublished financial information, budgets, projections, and efforts. Employee acknowledges that such information is secret, valuable and owned by the Company and that the Company has exercised substantial efforts to preserve the information’s secrecy.

  


* * *

  


b. Protection of Confidential Information. During and after Employee’s employment, Employee agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to any third party or to make any use of Confidential Information of the Company, except for the benefit of the Company and in the course of Employee’s employment with the Company. Employee also agrees not to remove or otherwise transmit Confidential Information or Inventions (as defined below) from the premises or possession of the Company without the express prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Company. Employee acknowledges that he or she is aware that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information of the Company may be highly prejudicial to its interests, an invasion of privacy, and an improper disclosure of trade secrets.

  


c. Third Party Information. Employee recognizes that the Company has received and in the future will receive confidential or proprietary information from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. Employee agrees to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or corporation and to use it as necessary in carrying out work for the Company consistent with the Company's agreement with such third party.

  


d. Prior Obligations. Employee acknowledges and represents that Employee is not a party to any agreement or agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.) with a former employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict Employee’s ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict Employee’s ability to perform any obligation or responsibility Employee may have to the Company. Employee represents and warrants that Employee has returned all property and confidential information belonging to all prior employers.

  


e. Exclusive Employment and Non-Solicitation of Customers, Affiliates, Sub-Affiliates or Employees. Employee acknowledges the highly confidential nature of information regarding the Company’s customers, affiliates, sub-affiliates, employees, agents, independent contractors, suppliers, and consultants. The Employee will not during Employee’s employment or within one year after it ends, without the Company’s express written consent, directly or indirectly (i) hire, solicit, recruit, or induce to leave the employ of the Company any employee, agent, independent contractor or consultant of the Company; (ii) use the Company’s Confidential Information to solicit the business of any clients or customers of the Company (other than on behalf of the Company); or (iii) encourage to terminate or alter any relationship between (a) the Company, and (b) any customer, affiliate, sub-affiliate, employee, agent, independent contractor, supplier, consultant, or any other person or company. During Employee’s employment with the Company, Employee will not do anything to compete with the Company’s present or contemplated business, nor will Employee plan or organize any competitive business activity. The Employee agrees that such activities would necessarily and inevitably involve disclosure or use of Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.

  


  


* * *

  


f. Prior Inventions and Proprietary Information. Except as disclosed on Exhibit A to this Agreement, Employee does not know anything about the Company’s Confidential Information, other than that which he or she learned from the Company. Employee also has disclosed on Exhibit A-1 complete list of all Inventions and information proprietary to Employee and which Employee wants to exclude from the application of this Agreement.

  


3\. Inventions.

  


a. Disclosure of Inventions. Employee will promptly disclose in writing and deliver to the Company within 10 days of all discoveries, developments, designs, enhancements, ideas, improvements, inventions, software, object codes, source codes, formulas, processes, techniques, know-how, and data (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes) made, conceived, reduced to practice, or learned by Employee (either alone or jointly with others) during each month of Employee’s employment, that are related to or useful in the business of the Company, or which result from tasks assigned to Employee by the Company, or from the use of premises owned, leased, or otherwise acquired by the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement, all of the foregoing are referred to as Inventions.

  


b. Assignment/Ownership of Inventions. Employee acknowledges and agrees that all Inventions other than those listed in Exhibit A belong to and shall be the sole property of the Company and shall be Inventions of the Company subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Employee assigns to the Company all right, title, and interest Employee may have or may acquire in and to all Inventions. Employee agrees to sign and deliver to the Company (either during or subsequent to Employee’s employment) such other documents as the Company considers desirable to evidence the assignment of all rights of Employee, if any, in any Inventions to the Company and the Company’s ownership of such Inventions. Any provision in this Agreement requiring Employee to assign rights to an Invention does not apply to any invention that qualifies under California Labor Code §2870, which section is reproduced in the attached Written Notification to Employee (Exhibit B-1).

  


c. Power of Attorney. In the event the Company is unable to secure Employee’s signature on any document necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain, or enforce any patent, copyright, or other right to protection relating to any Invention, whether due to mental or physical incapacity or any other cause, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and each of its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in Employee’s behalf and stead to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, and enforcement of patents, copyrights, or other rights or protections with the same force and effect as if executed and delivered by the Employee.

  


* * *

4\. Termination of Employment.

  


a. Delivery of Documents and Data Upon Termination of Employment.

In the event of termination (voluntary or otherwise) of Employee’s employment with the Company, Employee agrees, promptly and without request, to deliver to and inform the Company of all documents and data pertaining to Employee’s employment and the Confidential Information and Inventions of the Company, whether prepared by the Employee or otherwise coming into Employee’s possession or control, and to sign Exhibit C-1 to this Agreement. Employee will not retain any written or other tangible material containing any information concerning or disclosing any of the Confidential Information or Inventions of the Company. Employee recognizes that the unauthorized taking of any of the Company’s trade secrets is a crime under California Penal Code § 499(c) and is punishable by imprisonment in state prison or in a county jail for a time not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both such fine and such imprisonment. Employee further recognizes that such unauthorized taking of the Company’s trade secrets also could result in civil liability under California’s Uniform Trade Secret Act (Civil Code §§ 3426-3426.11), and that willful misappropriation may result in an award against Employee for triple the amount of the Company’s damages and the Company’s attorney’s fees in collecting such damages.

  


b. Obligations of Employee After Termination of Employment. In the event of termination (voluntary or otherwise) of Employee’s employment with the Company, Employee will protect the value of the Confidential Information and Inventions of the Company and will prevent their misappropriation or disclosure. Employee will not disclose or use to Employee’s benefit (or the benefit of any third party) or to the detriment of the Company any Confidential Information or Invention.

  


5\. Injunctive Relief. Because Employee’s breach of this Agreement may cause the Company irreparable harm for which money is inadequate compensation, Employee agrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security and in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.

  


6\. Attorney’ Fees. If any action is necessary to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees.

  


7\. Amendment and Binding Effect. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by both parties. This Agreement shall be binding on the heirs, executors, administrators, and other legal representatives and assigns of Employee, and is for the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.

  


8\. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.

  


9\. Entire Understanding. This Agreement expresses the entire understanding of the parties about the described subject matter, superseding all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter.

  


  


* * *

  


10\. Cumulative Remedies. Each and all of the several rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative. No one right or remedy shall be exclusive of the others or of any right or remedy allowed in law or in equity. No waiver or indulgence by the Company of any failure by Employee to keep or perform any promise or condition of this Agreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other promise or condition. No waiver by the Company of any right shall be construed as a waiver of any other right. Any waiver by the Company or by the Employee must be in writing and signed by both the Employee, if he or she is seeking to waive any of Employee’s rights under this Agreement, or by an officer of the Company (other than the Employee) or some other person duly authorized by the Company. The Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to the terms of this Agreement.

  


11\. Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to the other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as best to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace any such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

  


12\. Employment Terms. Employee understands that this Agreement is an integral part of Employee’s contract of employment with the Company.

  


13\. ADVICE OF COUNSEL. EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, EMPLOYEE HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND EMPLOYEE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.

WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO EMPLOYEE

In accordance with California Labor Code §2872, you are hereby notified that your Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement does not require you to assign to the Company an Invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and that was developed entirely on your own time, and does not relate to the business of the Company or to the Company’s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or does not result from any work performed by you for the Company.

  


Following is the text of California Labor Code §2870:

  


(a)

Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:  
  
  


(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer, or

  


(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

  


(b)

To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign his invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.
