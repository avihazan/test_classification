* * *

Section 2.09. No Conflict. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not, by the lapse of time, the giving of notice or otherwise: (a) constitute a violation of any law; (b) constitute a breach or violation of any provision contained in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company; (c) constitute a breach of any provision contained in, or a default under, any governmental approval, any writ, injunction, order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or any contract or agreement to which the Company is a party; or (d) result in or require the creation of any lien upon the Shares.

Section 2.12. Company Filings. All of the Company’s SEC Filings and the disclosures therein are accurate in all material respects and no SEC Filing contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary to make such filing or such statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties of Purchasers

  


Subject to all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, each of the Purchasers individually, and not jointly or severally, hereby represents and warrants to the Seller, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, as follows:

  


Section 3.01. Authority. Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Purchaser has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto and thereto, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and general equitable principles.

  


Section 3.02. No Conflict. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and shall not, by the lapse of time, the giving of notice or otherwise: (a) constitute a violation of any law; or (b) constitute a breach of any provision contained in, or a default under, any governmental approval, any writ, injunction, order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or any contract to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser is bound or affected.

  


Section 3.03. Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors. No broker, finder or financial advisor has acted for Purchaser in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no broker, finder or financial advisor is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s or financial advisor’s fee or other commission in respect thereof based in any way on any contract with Purchaser.

  


Section 3.04. Exempt Transaction. Purchaser understands that the offering and sale of the Shares (the “Securities”) is intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and exempt from registration or qualification under any state law.

  


Section 3.05. Representations of Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby represents, acknowledges and warrants his representation of, understanding of and confirmation of the following (which the Seller and the Company shall be able to rely on for any and all purposes):

  


(a) Purchaser acknowledges that he or she is a “sophisticated investor” (i.e., has experience and knowledge in and with investments in companies similar to the Company) and that the Purchaser has, in making Purchaser’s investment decision in connection with the Securities received, access to, had an opportunity to review and in fact has reviewed (A) the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011; (B) the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011; and (C) the Company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2012 and March 6, 2012, including in each case, the audited and unaudited financial statements, description of business, risk factors, results of operations, certain transactions and related business disclosures described therein; has read, reviewed, and relied solely on the documents described in (A), (B), and (C) above (collectively referred to as the “Disclosure Documents”), and an independent investigation made by Purchaser and Purchaser’s representatives, if any of the Company; (D) has, prior to the date of this Agreement, been given an opportunity to review material contracts and documents of the Company as filed, along with the Disclosure Documents on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar website (www.sec.gov); and (E) is not relying on any representations other than those contained in the Disclosure Documents or incorporated therein in connection with such Purchaser’s acceptance of the Securities and investment decision in connection therewith. The Purchaser acknowledges that due to Purchaser’s receipt of and review of the information described above, Purchaser received similar information as would be included in a Registration Statement filed under the Act;

  


* * *

(b) Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and of making an informed investment decision, and does not require a representative in evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities;

  


(c) Purchaser recognizes that an investment in the Company is a speculative venture and that the total amount of consideration tendered in connection with this Agreement is placed at the risk of the business and may be completely lost. The ownership of the Securities as an investment involves special risks;

  


(d) Purchaser realizes that the Securities cannot readily be sold as they will be restricted securities and therefore the Securities must not be accepted unless Purchaser has liquid assets sufficient to assure that Purchaser can provide for current needs and possible personal contingencies;

  


(e) Purchaser confirms and represents that he or she is able (i) to bear the economic risk of the Securities, (ii) to hold the Securities for an indefinite period of time, and (iii) to afford a complete loss of the Securities. Purchaser also represents that he or she has (i) adequate means of providing for his or her current needs and possible personal contingencies, and (ii) has no need for liquidity in the Securities;

  


(f) Purchaser has carefully considered and has, to the extent he or she believes such discussion necessary, discussed with his or her professional, legal, tax and financial advisors, the suitability of an investment in the Securities for his or her particular tax and financial situation and his or her advisers, if such advisors were deemed necessary, have determined that the Securities are a suitable investment for him or her;

  


* * *

(g) Neither the Company nor the Seller is under an obligation to register or seek an exemption under any federal and/or state securities acts for any sale or transfer of the Shares by the Purchaser, and Purchaser is solely responsible for determining the status, in his or her hands, of the Shares acquired in the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the availability, if required, of exemptions from registration for purposes of sale or transfer of the Shares; and

  


(h) Purchaser understands and agrees that a legend has been or will be placed on any certificate(s) or other document(s) evidencing the Securities in substantially the following form:

  


"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED OR ANY STATE SECURITIES ACT. THE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS (I) THEY SHALL HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES ACT, OR (II) THE CORPORATION SHALL HAVE BEEN FURNISHED WITH AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, SATISFACTORY TO COUNSEL FOR THE CORPORATION, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER ANY SUCH ACTS."

  


Section 3.06. Shell Company Status. Each Purchaser represents, acknowledges and warrants his or her understanding that, pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act (“Rule 144”), a “shell company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, the Company is a “shell company” pursuant to Rule 144, and resales of its securities pursuant to Rule 144 may not be made until all of the following criteria set forth in Rule 144(i)(2) have been met: (1) the Company has ceased to be a shell company, (2) the Company is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), (3) the Company has filed all of its required periodic reports (other than Form 8-K’s) for the prior one year period, and (4) a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date “Form 10 like information” was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) reflecting the Company’s status as a non-shell company. As a result, because none of the Company’s securities can be resold pursuant to Rule 144 until at least a year after the Company has complied with Rule 144(i)(2), no non-registered or “restricted” shares of the Company’s common stock, including, but not limited to the Shares, will be able to be sold pursuant to Rule 144 until and unless such securities are registered with the Commission, an exemption for the sales can be relied upon other than Rule 144 and/or until a year after the Company has complied with the requirements of Rule 144(i)(2) as described above. As a result, the Purchaser may never be able to sell any Securities. Furthermore, as the Company may not ever comply with Rule 144(i)(2), the Purchaser may be forced to hold such Securities indefinitely.

  


* * *

Section 3.07. OTCBB Strikes. Each Purchaser confirms and acknowledges that such Purchaser is aware of the fact that the Company currently has two (2) strikes (i.e., two previous late filings) with the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (the “OTCBB”) and that pursuant to OTCBB rules relating to the timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), any OTCBB issuer which fails to file a periodic report (Form 10-Q or 10-K) by the due date of such report (not withstanding any extension granted to the issuer by the filing of a Form 12b-25), three times during any 24 month period is automatically de-listed from the OTCBB. Such removed issuer would not be re-eligible to be listed on the OTCBB for a period of one year, during which time any subsequent late filing would reset the one-year period of de-listing. Additionally, if a market maker fails to quote an issuer’s common stock on the OTCBB for a period of more than four consecutive days, such issuer will be automatically delisted from the OTCBB. If the Company is late in its SEC filings one additional time prior to the filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, the Company will be delisted from the OTCBB and prohibited from relisting for a period of at least one year.

  


Section 3.08. Section 16 and Schedule 13D Filings. Each Purchaser agrees and confirms that such Purchaser will have Section 16 and Schedule 13D filing obligations with the SEC immediately upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and such Purchaser agrees to take whatever action necessary to make and file such required filings with the SEC.

  


ARTICLE IV

Covenants

  


Section 4.01. Further Assurances. Seller and Purchasers agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing, each of them will take such other action and to execute, acknowledge and deliver such contracts, deeds, or other documents (a) as may be reasonably requested and necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement; or (b) to effect or evidence the transfer to the Purchasers of the Shares held by or in the name of the Seller.

  


Section 4.02. Insider Trading. The Parties hereby certify that they have not themselves, nor through any third parties, purchased nor caused to be purchased in the public marketplace any publicly traded shares of the Company. The Parties further certify they have not communicated the nature of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are not aware of any disclosure of non-public information concerning said transactions, and are not a party to any insider trading of Company shares.

  


Section 4.03. Public Announcements. Except as required by law, without the prior written approval of the other Parties, neither the Seller, the Company nor the Purchasers will issue, or permit any agent or affiliate thereof to issue, any press release or otherwise make or permit any agent or affiliate thereof to make, any public statement or announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties further confirm and acknowledge however that following the Closing of this Agreement, the Company shall file a Form 8-K disclosing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.

  


* * *

Section 4.04. Seller Assistance. Prior to or following the Closing, the Seller shall provide, at his sole cost and expense, prompt and reasonable assistance to the Purchasers in connection with the Company’s filing obligations with the SEC, the preparation of financial statements which are required to be filed with the SEC, and other Company related matters and filings (both federal and state), including, but not limited to the Company’s tax returns.

  


Section 4.05. Survival of Representations. All representations, warranties, and agreements made by any Party in this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any Party.
