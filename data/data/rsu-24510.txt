TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  
  
  
1.

Grant of Stock Units. Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, the Company hereby grants you the Stock Units as set forth on the first page of this Agreement. Each Stock Unit represents the right to receive one Share on the date the Stock Unit vests, if it vests (subject to adjustment for a change in capitalization within the meaning of Section 4.3 of the Plan). Prior to vesting, such Stock Units represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) from the general assets of the Company.  
  
  
  
  
2.

Vesting and Expiration. The Stock Units will vest, if at all, as set forth on the first page of this Agreement if the Objective has been achieved, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan. Upon expiration of the Restriction Period set forth on the first page of this Agreement, all Stock Units that are not then vested because the Objective was not achieved will be forfeited and have no further effect.  
  
  
  
  
3.

Forfeiture of Stock Units upon Termination of Service.  Upon any Termination of Service, all Stock Units that are not then vested will be forfeited and have no further effect.  
  
  
  
  
4.

Forfeiture of Stock Units for Awards Not Timely Accepted. This Award is conditioned upon and subject to your accepting the Award by signing and delivering to the Company this Agreement no later than the first date the Stock Units vest pursuant to the Award. If you fail to accept the Award within the time described above, all Stock Units will be forfeited and have no further effect.  
  
  
  
  
5.

Settlement of Stock Units. Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, any Stock Units that vest and become non-forfeitable upon determination that the Objective has been achieved shall be released and settled during the 90 day period following the end of the Company's fiscal quarter in which such determination was made (which payment date is intended to comply with the “short-term” deferral exemption from the application of Section 409A of the Code). Upon settlement, the Company shall deliver to you (or, in the event of your death following the date of vest, to your estate or, if the Committee establishes a beneficiary designation procedure pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan, to any beneficiary that you have designated pursuant to such procedure) one or more certificates for the vested Shares or, in the Company's discretion, may cause the vested Shares to be deposited in an account maintained by a broker designated by the Company.  
  
  


6\. Responsibility for Taxes.  
  
(a)

For purposes of this Agreement, “Tax-Related Items” means any or all income tax, social insurance tax, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items that may be applicable to this Award by law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or local, domestic or foreign. Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to withholding Tax-Related Items, you acknowledge that you are ultimately responsible for all Tax-Related Items and that such Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Stock Units, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or release of the Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents pursuant to Shares; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former Employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer; or (2) selling or arranging for the sale of Shares that you acquire under the Plan; or (3) withholding of Shares consistent with the “Share Withholding” provisions under Section 13.2 of the Plan.  
  
  
  
  
(c)

Depending upon the withholding method, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other   
  
  


  


* * *

  


  


applicable withholding rates. In the event Tax-Related Items are over-withheld, you will receive a refund in cash for any over-withheld amounts during the settlement period provided in Section 5 and will have no entitlement to the Shares equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding of Shares, you shall be deemed, for tax purposes, to have been issued the full number of Shares, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

  
  
  
(d)

You shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to release and settle the Stock Units if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.  
  
  
  
  
7.

Transfer of Stock Units. The Stock Units and any rights under this Agreement may not be assigned, pledged as collateral or otherwise transferred, except as permitted by the Plan, nor may the Stock Units or such rights be subject to attachment, execution or other judicial process. In the event of any attempt to assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Stock Units or any rights under this Agreement, except as permitted by the Plan, or in the event of the levy of any attachment, execution or similar judicial process upon the rights or interests with respect to the Stock Units, the Committee may in its discretion, upon notice to you, cause you to forfeit such Stock Units.  
  
  


8\. Rights Prior to Vesting of Stock Units.

  
  
  
(a)

You will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable under the Stock Units until such Shares have been duly issued by the Company or its transfer agent pursuant to the vesting and settlement of the Award.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

In the event of a change in capitalization within the meaning of Section 4.3 of the Plan, the number and class of Shares or other securities that you are entitled to pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted or changed as determined by the Committee to reflect the change in capitalization, provided that any such additional Shares or additional or different shares of securities shall remain subject to the restrictions in this Agreement.  
  
  


9\. Termination of Service.

  
  
  
(a)

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan, for purposes of this Agreement “Termination of Service” means the discontinuance of your relationship with the Company as an employee of the Company or the Employer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company under the Plan. Except as determined otherwise by the Committee, you will not be deemed to have incurred a Termination of Service if you transfer employment among the various subsidiaries or affiliates of the Company constituting the Employer, so long as there is no interruption in your provision of services to the Company or other Employer as an employee. The Committee, in its discretion, will determine whether you have incurred a Termination of Service. You will not be deemed to have incurred a Termination of Service during a period for which you are on military leave, sick leave, or other leave of absence approved by the Employer.  
  
  
  
  
(b)

If you are deemed to have incurred a Termination of Service, your right to vest in the Stock Units under this Agreement or the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing services to the Company or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates (regardless of the reason for the termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee, in its discretion, will determine when you are no longer actively providing services for purposes of this Award (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).  
  
  
  
  
10.

Provisions of the Plan. The provisions of the Plan are incorporated by reference in this Agreement as if set out in full in this Agreement. To the extent that any conflict may exist between any other provision of this Agreement and a provision of the Plan, the Plan provision will control. All decisions of the Committee with respect to the interpretation, construction and application of the Plan or this Agreement shall be final, conclusive and binding upon you and the Company.

11.

Detrimental Activity.

In addition, if you engage in any Detrimental Activity prior to or within one (1) year after your Termination of Service, the Committee in its sole discretion may require you to pay to the Company the amount of all gain you realized from any vesting of the Stock Units beginning six (6) months prior to your Termination of Service, provided that the Committee gives you notice of such requirement within one (1) year after your Termination of Service. In that event, the Company will be entitled to setoff such amount against any amount the Company owes to you, in addition to any other rights the Company may have. For purposes of this section:

(5)

any act of fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, or tortious or criminal behavior that adversely impacts the Company.  
  
  
  
  
(c)

“Competing Business” means any corporation, partnership, university, government agency or other entity or person (other than the Company) that is conducting research directed to, developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing, or selling any product, service, or technology that is competitive with any part of the Company's Business (as defined below). "Company's Business" means the development, manufacture, marketing, distribution, or sale of, or the conduct of research directed to, any product, service, or technology that the Company is developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing, selling, or conducting research directed to, at any time during your employment or other relationship with the Company, except that following your Termination of Service the Company's Business will be determined as of the time of such termination. As of the effective date of this Agreement, the Company's Business includes but is not limited to the conduct of research directed to, development, manufacture, marketing, distribution, and/or sale of the following products, services, and technologies: (1) silicon carbide (SiC) materials for electronic applications; (2) SiC materials for gemstone applications; (3) AIII nitride materials for electronic applications; (4) light-emitting diode (LED) devices and components; (5) power semiconductor devices made using SiC and/or AIII nitride materials and components incorporating such devices; (6) radio frequency (RF) and microwave devices made using SiC and/or AIII nitride materials and components and modules incorporating such devices; (7) LED backlights for liquid crystal displays (LCDs); (8) lighting products, modules, fixtures or devices incorporating any of the above materials or technology; and (9) other semiconductor devices made using SiC and/or AIII nitride materials and components incorporating such devices.

12.

Data Privacy. You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials (“Data”) by and among, as applicable, your Employer, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  
  
  


  


* * *

  


  


You understand that the Employer holds or may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, position title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of the Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.

You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties as may be selected by the Company currently or in the future, which are assisting the Company in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that these recipients may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Company's Stock Plan Administrator. You authorize the Company and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party whom you subsequently may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan. You understand that Data will be held pursuant to this Agreement only as long as the Company considers it necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents above, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Company's Stock Plan Administrator. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you the Stock Units or any other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you acknowledge that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you may contact the Stock Plan Administrator of the Company.

(b)

the grant of the Stock Units is voluntary and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Stock Units, even if Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past;  
  
  


  


* * *

(d)

your participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(f)

if you are employed by a non-U.S. entity and provide services outside the U.S., the Stock Units are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to your Employer, and they are outside the scope of your employment or service contract, if any, with your Employer;  
  
  
  
  
(g)

the grant of the Stock Units is not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

(i)

the grant of Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company;  
  
  
  
  
(j)

(l)

the grant of the Stock Units and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, takeover, or transfer of liability;  
  
  
  
  
(m)

neither the Company, the Employer nor any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Stock Units or of any payments due to you pursuant to the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon the vesting of the Stock Units; and

Compliance with Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available

exemption from any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Stock Units, the Company shall not be required to deliver the Stock Units or any of the underlying Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that the Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Stock Units or any of the underlying Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance of the Stock Units and Shares.

20.

Waiver. You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other participant.  
  
  
  
  
21.

Appendix. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, this Award shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for your country to the extent that the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or to facilitate the administration of the Plan. Moreover, if you relocate to or from one of the countries included on any such Appendix, the special terms and conditions for the country you are moving from and/or the country you are moving to will apply to you to the extent that the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or to facilitate the administration of the Plan. If included, the Appendix is incorporated in and constitutes part of this Agreement.  
  
  
  
  
22.

Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or to facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  
  
  
  
  
23.

Code Section 409A. The Award is intended to qualify for the “short-term deferral” exemption from Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of this Agreement will be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, without your consent, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and/or this Agreement to ensure that the Stock Units qualify for exemption from or comply with Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations that the Stock Units will be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to these Stock Units. The Company will have no liability to you or to any other party if the Award, the vesting of the Award, delivery of Shares upon settlement of the Award or any other event hereunder that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code, is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Company with respect thereto.
