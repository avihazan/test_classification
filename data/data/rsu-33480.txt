SECTION 5  
ADJUSTMENTS 

5.1 NO EFFECT ON CHANGES IN CORPORATION’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The existence of the Options shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Corporation or its shareholders to make or authorize any adjustments, recapitalization, reorganization, or other changes in the Corporation’s capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or preference stocks ahead of or affecting the Option Shares, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
