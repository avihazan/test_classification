NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Corporation and the Optionee agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Option

THE OPTION GRANTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE TREATED AS AN “INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION” WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 422 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. 

2\. Exercise of Option

The Option granted in paragraph 1 may be exercised in whole or in part in accordance with the following vesting schedule.

The second installment for ______ shares may be exercised in whole or in part beginning _________, 200___.

The third installment for ______ shares may be exercised in whole or in part beginning _________, 200___.

In case an installment is not immediately exercisable, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board may in its discretion accelerate the time at which the installment may be exercised. To the extent not exercised, installments shall accumulate and be exercisable by the Optionee during the Option Period. Continued accrual of installments shall cease immediately upon termination of employment for any reason whatsoever, subject to acceleration by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. 

3\. Method of Exercising Option and Payment of Exercise Price

The Option shall be exercised by delivery of a written Notice of Exercise stating the number of shares the Optionee desires to purchase. The form of Notice of Exercise is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. Notice(s) should be delivered to Valerie Zook, The Ryland Group, Inc., 24025 Park Sorrento, Suite 400, Calabasas, CA 91302; Telephone No. (818) 223-7558; Facsimile No. (818) 223-7675. 

The Optionee shall pay the exercise price in the following ways:

(b) if approved by the Corporation, cash payment may be made from the proceeds of an immediate sale of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of the Option; or

(c) if approved by the Corporation, delivery of Common Stock (including executed stock powers attached thereto).

The payment of the exercise price shall be delivered to Valerie Zook together with the Notice of Exercise. 

The Corporation shall, subject to the receipt of withholding tax, issue to the Optionee the stock certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is exercised. 

The value of shares of Common Stock used as payment for the exercise of an Option shall be the closing price of such shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise of an Option or if no longer listed on such exchange, as otherwise determined by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board. 

4\. Certain Tax Matters

The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board shall have absolute discretion to determine whether any other termination of Optionee’s employment is to be considered as retirement for the purposes of this Agreement and whether an authorized leave of absence or otherwise shall constitute a termination of employment for the purposes of this Agreement.

6\. Assignability

The Option is not assignable or transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Option is exercisable during the Optionee’s lifetime only by the Optionee or the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative. 

7\. Rights as a Stockholder

The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the Option until the date of issuance of the shares to the Optionee, and the Corporation has receipt of payment for the full exercise price of the Option shares. No adjustment will be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the shares of Common Stock related to the exercise of an Option. 

8\. Merger, Consolidation or Share Exchange

After any merger, consolidation or share exchange in which the Corporation is the surviving or resulting corporation, the Optionee shall be entitled, upon the exercise of an Option, to receive the number and class of shares of stock or other consideration to which the Optionee would have been entitled, if, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or share exchange, the Optionee had exercised the Option in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. If the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting corporation in any merger, consolidation or share exchange, the surviving or resulting corporation shall tender stock options to purchase its shares on terms and conditions that substantially preserve the rights and benefits under this Option.

10\. Employee’s Agreement

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Optionee agrees that Optionee will not exercise any Option and the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock or make any cash payment if counsel to the Corporation determines such exercise, delivery or payment would violate any law or regulation of any governmental authority or agreement to which the Corporation is subject. 

11\. Resolution of Disputes
