NEITHER THIS OPTION NOR THE SHARES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE. THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR SOLD IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION OR OTHER COMPLIANCE UNDER THE ACT OR THE LAWS OF THE APPLICABLE STATE OR A “NO ACTION” OR INTERPRETIVE LETTER FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER, AND ITS COUNSEL, TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND SUCH STATE STATUTES.

  




  


DENALI CONCRETE MANAGEMENT, INC., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), desiring to afford an opportunity to TRAUM-URLAUB, INC., a Utah corporation (the “Grantee”) to purchase certain shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”), hereby grants to the Grantee, and the Grantee hereby accepts, an option to purchase the number of such shares specified below, during the term ending at midnight (prevailing local time at the Company’s principal offices) on the expiration date of this option specified below, at the option exercise price specified below, subject to and upon the following terms and conditions:

  


1.

Grant of Option. The Company hereby irrevocable grants to Grantee the right and option to purchase all or any part of an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions hereof (the “Option”). This Option is not intended to be and shall not be treated as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.

  


2.

Exercise Price. The exercise price of this Option shall be US$1.144 per share.

  


3.

Expiration Date. Except otherwise provided herein, any unexercised options granted pursuant to this Option shall expire on January 20, 2013.

  


4.

Method of Exercise. This Option may be exercised by delivery of a notice of exercise, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference, setting forth the number of Options to be exercised together with either:

  


a.

A certified check or bank check payable to, or funds wired to, the order of the Company in the amount of the full exercise price of the Common Stock being purchased;

  


b.

Cancellation of debt owed by the Company to the Grantee, including debt incurred for services rendered, employment relationships, or otherwise, upon presentation of an invoice for services provided to the Company.

  


As soon as practicable after receipt by the Company of such notice, a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall be issued in the name of the Grantee, or, if the Grantee shall so request in the notice exercising the Option, in the name of the Grantee and another person jointly, with right of survivorship, and shall be delivered to the Grantee. If this Option is not exercised with respect to all Common Stock subject hereto, Grantee shall be entitled to receive a similar Option of like tenor covering the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which this Option shall not have been exercised.

  


5.

Shareholder’s Rights. The Grantee shall have the rights of a shareholder only with respect to Common Stock fully paid for by Grantee under this Option.

  


6.

Transferability. This Option may be transferred, in whole or in part, without restriction by the Company, subject only to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. Any such transfer shall be accompanied by an assignment of interest form, attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein, whereby the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Option.

  
  


* * *

  


7.

Adjustment to Number of Shares of Common Stock. In the event that the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company from time to time issued and outstanding is increased pursuant to a stock split or a stock dividend, the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by this Option shall be increased proportionately, with no increase in the total purchase price of the shares then so covered. In the event that the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company from time to time issued and outstanding is reduced by a combination or consolidation of shares, the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by this Option shall be reduced proportionately, with no reduction in the total purchase price of the shares then so covered. In the event that the Company should transfer assets to another corporation and distribute the stock of such other corporation without the surrender of Common Stock of the Company, and if such distribution is not taxable as a dividend and no gain or loss is recognized by reason of section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any amendment or successor statute of like tenor, then the total purchase price of the Common Stock then covered by each outstanding Option shall be reduced by an amount that bears the same ratio to the total purchase price then in effect as the market value of the stock distributed in respect of a share of the Common Stock of the Company, immediately following the distribution, bears to the aggregate of the market value at such time of a share of the Common Stock of the Company plus the stock distributed in respect thereof. In the event that the Company distributes the stock of a subsidiary to its shareholders, makes a distribution of a major portion of its assets, or otherwise distributes significant portion of the value of its issued and outstanding Common Stock to its shareholders, the number of shares then subject to this Option, or the exercise price of this Option, may be adjusted in the reasonable discretion of the Board or a duly authorized committee. All such adjustments shall be made by the Board or duly authorized committee, whose determination upon the same, absent demonstrable error, shall be final and binding. No fractional shares shall be issued, and any fractional shares resulting from the computations pursuant to this section shall be rounded up to the next whole share. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends, for the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock for consideration approved by the Board, or for the issuance to stockholders of rights to subscribe for additional Common Stock or other securities.

  


8.

Withholding. If the exercise of this Option is subject to withholding of federal, state, local, or foreign taxes, such requirements may, at the discretion of the Board or a duly authorized committee, and to the extent permitted by the then governing provisions of law, be met (i) by the holder of this Option either delivering shares of Common Stock or canceling Options with a fair market value equal to such requirements, such fair market value to be determined by the Board; (ii) by the Company withholding shares of Common Stock subject to this Option with a fair market value equal to such requirements, such fair market value to be determined by the Board; (iii) by the Grantee delivering with the Form of Exercise funds equal to the amount of such taxes; or (iv) by the Company making such withholding payments and the Grantee reimbursing the Company such amount paid within ten (10) days after written demand therefor from the Company. In no event, however, shall the Company be permitted to require payment from the Grantee in excess of the maximum required tax withholding rates.

  


9.

Availability of Shares. During the term of this Option, the Company shall at all times reserve for issuance the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option.

  


10.

Requirements of Law. By accepting this Option, the Grantee represents and agrees for itself, himself or herself and its, his, or her transferees that, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 is in effect as to shares purchased upon any exercise of this Option, (a) any and all shares so purchased shall be acquired for his personal account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution, and (b) each notice of the exercise of any portion of this Option shall be accompanied by a representation and warranty in writing, signed by the person entitled to exercise the same, that the shares are being so acquired in good faith for his personal account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution. No certificate or certificates for shares of stock purchased upon exercise of this Option shall be issued and delivered unless and until, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Company, such securities may be issued and delivered without causing the Company to be in violation of or incur any liability under any federal, state, or other securities law or any other requirement of law or of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Company. The Grantee, for itself, himself or herself and its, his or her transferees, agrees to provide information reasonably requested by the Company in order to satisfy the requirements of any exemption from the registration provisions of federal or state securities laws.

  


11.

No Right of Employment. Nothing contained in this Option shall be construed as conferring on the Grantee any right to continue or remain as an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.
