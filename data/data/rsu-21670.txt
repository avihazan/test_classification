2\.  Award. The Participant is hereby granted the number of shares of Restricted Stock set forth in paragraph 1.

  


3\.  Dividends and Voting Rights. The Participant shall be entitled to receive any dividends paid with respect to shares of Restricted Stock that become payable during the Restricted Period (as defined below); provided, however, that no dividends shall be payable to or for the benefit of the Participant for shares of Restricted Stock with respect to record dates occurring prior to the Grant Date, or with respect to record dates occurring on or after the date, if any, on which the Participant has forfeited those shares of Restricted Stock. The Participant shall be entitled to vote the shares of Restricted Stock during the Restricted Period to the same extent as would have been applicable to the Participant if the Participant was then vested in the shares; provided, however, that the Participant shall not be entitled to vote the shares with respect to record dates for such voting rights arising prior to the Grant Date, or with respect to record dates occurring on or after the date, if any, on which the Participant has forfeited those shares of Restricted Stock.

  


4\.  Deposit of Shares of Restricted Stock. Each certificate issued in respect of shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall be held by the Company until the earlier to occur of (a) the Date Termination (as defined below), in which case it shall be returned to the Company and cancelled, and (b) the Vesting Date with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock represented by such certificate, in which case the legends required by Section 9 shall be removed and (contingent upon the payment by the Participant to the Company in cash or by check of an amount equal to the amount the Company is required to withhold under governing tax laws with respect to such Restricted Stock) the certificate shall be conveyed to the Participant . The grant of Restricted Stock is conditioned upon the Participant endorsing in blank a stock power for the Restricted Stock. The "Date of Termination" shall be the first day occurring on or after the Grant Date on which the Participant is not employed by, or serving as a director of, the Company or any consolidated subsidiary of the Company (a “Subsidiary”), regardless of the reason for the termination of employment or service. A termination of employment or service shall not be deemed to occur by reason of a transfer of the Participant between the Company and a Subsidiary or between two Subsidiaries, and the Participant's employment or service shall not be considered terminated while the Participant is on a leave of absence from the Company or a Subsidiary approved by the Participant's employer.

5\.  Prohibitions on Transfer. No shares of Restricted Stock may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period with respect to such shares of Restricted Stock. If the participant purports to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any shares of Restricted Stock prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period applicable to such shares, such shares will immediately and automatically be forfeited to the Company.

  


6\.  Transfer and Forfeiture of Shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7, the Participant shall immediately and automatically forfeit to the Company any Installment of Restricted Stock with respect to which the Date of Termination occurs during the Restricted Period (or with respect to which the Participant has failed to pay to the Company in cash or by check of, within 30 days of request by the Company, an amount equal to the amount the Company is required to withhold under governing tax laws with respect to such Installment of Restricted Stock). If the Date of Termination does not occur during the Restricted Period with respect to any Installment of shares of Restricted Stock, then, at the end of the Restricted Period for such shares, the Participant shall become vested in those shares of Restricted Stock, and shall own the shares free of all restrictions imposed by Sections 5 and 9 of this Agreement.

  


7\.  Early Termination of Restricted Period. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6, to the extent that the Date of Termination has not occurred, the Restricted Period with respect to all Installments of Restricted Stock shall immediately and automatically terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
