11\. Excessive Shares. In the event that the number of Shares subject to the Qualified Option exceeds any maximum established under the Code for incentive stock options that may be granted to the Optionee, the Qualified Option shall be considered a non-qualified option for purposes of the Code to the extent of such excess.

  


12\. Amendment. The Options may be amended as provided in the Plan.
