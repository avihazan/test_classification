2\. Shares Held in Escrow. Unless and until the Shares of Restricted Stock shall have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 or 6, such Shares shall be issued in the name of the Employee and held by the Secretary of the Company as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), and shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated. The Company may instruct the transfer agent for its Common Stock to place a legend on the certificates representing the Restricted Stock or otherwise note its records as to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. The certificate or certificates representing such Shares shall not be delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Employee unless and until the Shares have vested and all other terms and conditions in this Agreement have been satisfied.

In the event of the Employee’s Termination of Service due to his or her death, Retirement, or Disability, one hundred percent (100%) of any unvested Shares awarded by this Agreement shall immediately vest. The Shares which so vest shall be deemed to have vested as of the date of the Termination of Service.

7\. Forfeiture. Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, and notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, Shares of Restricted Stock which have not vested at the time of the Employee’s Termination of Service shall thereupon be forfeited and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company. The Employee hereby appoints the Escrow Agent with full power of substitution, as the Employee’s true and lawful attorney-in-fact with irrevocable power and authority in the name and on behalf of the Employee to take any action and execute all documents and instruments, including, without limitation, stock powers which may be necessary to transfer the certificate or certificates evidencing such unvested Shares to the Company upon such Termination of Service.

8\. Death of Employee. Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement shall, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the Employee’s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives the Employee, to the administrator or executor of the Employee’s estate.

9\. Withholding of Taxes. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no certificate representing Restricted Stock may be released from the escrow established pursuant to paragraph 2 unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee) shall have been made by the Employee with respect to the payment of income and employment taxes which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such Shares.

10\. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or the Escrow Agent.

11\. No Effect on Employment. The Employee’s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at-will basis only. Accordingly, the terms of the Employee’s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Employee (as the case may be), and the Company or the Subsidiary shall have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause.
