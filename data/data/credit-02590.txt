If, during the period for which Consolidated Operating EBITDA is being calculated, the Borrower or any Subsidiary has (i) acquired sufficient Capital Stock of a Person to cause such Person to become a Subsidiary; (ii) acquired all or substantially all of the assets or operations, division or line of business of a Person; (iii) disposed of sufficient Capital Stock of a Subsidiary to cause such Subsidiary to cease to be a Subsidiary; or (iv) disposed of all or substantially all of the assets or operations of a Subsidiary, Consolidated Operating EBITDA shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such acquisition or disposition had occurred on the first day of such period. 

“Convertible Debt” means Debt issued by the Borrower which by its terms may be converted into or exchanged for equity securities of the Borrower at the option of the Borrower or the holder of such Debt, including without limitation, Debt with respect to which the performance due by the Borrower may be measured in whole or in part by reference to the value of an equity security of the Borrower but may be satisfied in whole or in part in cash. 

“Loyalty Management” means LoyaltyOne, Inc., an Ontario corporation. 

“Insured Subsidiary” means a Subsidiary of the Borrower which is an “insured depository institution” under and as defined in the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2)) or any successor statute or which has an analogous status under the laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof. 

“Qualifying Deposits” means deposits that are (i) insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or, in the case of an Insured Subsidiary organized under the laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation) or any successor entity and (ii) do not exceed the difference between (A) the amount of credit card receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts minus (B) the amount of Asset Backed Securities Debt, in each case as shown on the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. 

“Restricted Payment” means (i) any dividend or other distribution on any shares of a Person’s (including any Credit Party’s) capital stock (except dividends or distributions payable solely in shares of its capital stock and except dividends and distributions payable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of (a) any shares of a Person’s (including any Credit Party’s) capital stock or (b) any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of a Person’s capital stock (but not including (1) payments of principal, premium (if any) or interest made pursuant to the terms of Convertible Debt prior to or in connection with conversion, (2) payments made to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (3) payments made solely in shares of (or solely out of the net proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance of) such Person’s (including any Credit Party’s) capital stock or options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of such Persons’ (including any Credit Party’s) capital stock).

Article II  
Consent
