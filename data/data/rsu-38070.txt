PART II

This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into by and between TXCO Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the recipient named on Part I (the “Recipient”), as of the date set forth on Part I (the “Award Date”). 

RECITALS: 

The Company has adopted the TXCO Resources, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Plan”) to provide an incentive for key employees, consultants and directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to remain in the service of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to extend to them the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company so that they will apply their best efforts for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to aid the Company in attracting able persons to enter the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries; 

The Board of Directors of the Company (or the Compensation Committee of the Company, if one has been authorized to administer the Plan by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”)), believes that the grant of the restricted stock award herein described to the Recipient is consistent with the purposes for which the Plan was adopted; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Recipient agree as follows: 

1\. Restricted Stock Award. The Company hereby grants to the Recipient the right (the “Award”) to receive the aggregate number of shares set forth on Part I (such number being subject to adjustment as provided herein) of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the “Shares”) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Award granted under this Agreement is intended to involve vesting restrictions (the “Restrictions”)

constituting a “significant risk of forfeiture” within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code and shall be so construed; provided, however, that the Company makes no representation or warranty that such Award does so qualify and the Company shall bear no liability in the event that such Award fails to so qualify. 

2\. Purchase Price. The Recipient shall not be required to make any cash payment to acquire full ownership of the Shares, but will be required to comply with the Vesting Schedule set forth on Part I, and the vesting provisions set forth in paragraph 3 of this Agreement. 

3\. Vesting and Term of the Award. 

(a) General. Subject to possible accelerated vesting under the terms of that certain Settlement Agreement dated March 15, 2008 (the “Settlement Agreement”), between the Company, Third Point LLC, the Recipient, et al., the Restrictions shall lapse in accordance with the provisions of Part I. Shares which shall have vested shall be referred to as “Vested Shares.” Shares which shall not have vested shall be referred to as “Unvested Shares.” Also subject to possible accelerated vesting under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, shares may become Vested Shares in accordance with Article IX of the Plan or Part I of this Agreement. In general, Unvested Shares may become Vested Shares only if the Recipient has been continuously a director of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity from the Award Date to and including dates set forth in Part I. 

(b) Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control as defined in the Plan, the provisions of the second paragraph of Article IX of the Plan shall apply and cause Unvested Shares to become Vested Shares upon the occurrence of the Change of Control, and the alternatives specified in the first paragraph of Article IX (i.e., the assumption or substitution of new awards) shall not be available. 

4\. Delivery of Shares. Share certificates evidencing Unvested Shares may be issued, but held by the Company until such time as they become Vested Shares. No Share certificates shall be physically delivered to the Recipient until (a) such Shares have become Vested Shares; (b) all the applicable taxes required to be withheld have been paid or withheld in full; (c) approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the issuance of Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been received by the Company; and (d) if required by the Committee, the Recipient has delivered to the Committee an Investment Letter in form and content satisfactory to the Company as provided in paragraph 8 of this Agreement. 

5\. Termination of Employment. 

(a) Death or Disability. If the Recipient ceases to be a director of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity due to the Recipient’s death or Disability (as defined in the Plan), then any and all Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement that are Unvested Shares as of the date of the termination shall become Vested Shares as of the date of such termination.

##### 

(b) Other Terminations; Special Circumstances. Subject to subparagraph (a) above, if the Recipient’s director relationship is terminated under special circumstances as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the vesting requirements, all or in part, otherwise applicable to such Recipient’s Unvested Shares. To the extent such vesting requirements are not waived by the Committee, all Shares that are Unvested Shares as of such termination (together with any stock or cash dividends attributable to such Unvested Shares), shall revert to the Company without any payment or other consideration to Recipient, and the Recipient shall have no further right, title or interest in or to such Unvested Shares, or to any stock or cash dividends attributable thereto. 

6\. Nontransferability. The Award granted by this Agreement is made solely to the Recipient and is nontransferable. Unvested Shares acquired under this Agreement are transferable by the Recipient only by will or pursuant to applicable laws of descent and distribution. The Award and the Unvested Shares, and any rights and privileges in connection therewith, cannot be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Recipient, or by any other person or persons, in any way, whether by operation of law, or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or similar process. In the event of any such occurrence, the Recipient’s right to have any Unvested Shares vest, and thereby become Vested Shares, will immediately and automatically terminate. 

7\. Adjustments. If there is any change in the capital structure of the Company through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares or similar event (a “Restructuring”), the rights of the Recipient to the Shares shall be adjusted as provided in Article VII of the Plan. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make or authorize any Restructuring. 

8\. Securities Act. The Company will not be required to issue or deliver any Share certificates pursuant to this Award if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such issuance would violate the Securities Act or any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. It is the Company’s intention that a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) will be effective with respect to the Shares at the time Unvested Shares become Vested Shares and are then delivered to the Recipient. However, if for any reason such a registration statement is not in effect at such time, the Committee may require that the Recipient, prior to the delivery of any such Shares pursuant to this Award, sign and deliver to the Company a written statement (an “Investment Letter”) stating, as applicable, that (a) the Recipient is purchasing the Shares for his own account and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, he has no present or contemplated agreement, undertaking, arrangement, obligation, indebtedness or commitment providing for the disposition thereof and he does not currently have any reason to anticipate a change in the foregoing; (b) the Recipient understands, if correct, that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws or regulations and, therefore, cannot be offered or resold unless the Shares are so registered or an applicable exemption from registration is available; and (c) the Recipient agrees, if correct, that the certificates representing the Shares may bear a legend to the effect set forth in clause (b) above. The Investment Letter must be in form and substance acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion.

arbitrate, is hereby created); ERISA violations; and other statutory and common law claims and disputes.

The arbitrator shall coordinate, and limit as appropriate, all pre-arbitral discovery, which shall include document production, information requests, and depositions. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision and award stating the reasons therefore. The decision and award shall be final and binding on both parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns.

(b) Definition of Owner. For purposes of paragraph 17 of this Agreement, the term "Owner” shall include the Recipient and all subsequent holders of the Unvested Shares who derive their chain of ownership through a permitted transfer from the Recipient in accordance with paragraph 17(a). 

(c) Agreement Applicable to Community Interests. Any right or interest of a spouse of an Owner in Unvested Shares, whether such right or interest is created by law (including community property laws) or otherwise, shall for all purposes hereof be included in, deemed a part of and bound by the same terms hereof as the Unvested Shares to which such right or interest relates or appertains, and all provisions of this Agreement applicable to Unvested Shares owned by an Owner shall be applicable to any right or interest which the spouse of such Owner may have or be entitled to have therein. 

(d) Purchase of Spouse’s Interest in Unvested Shares. In the event of the death of an Owner’s spouse, or the divorce of an Owner and his or her spouse, such Owner shall have the right to purchase all or any part of the Unvested Shares (and any interest therein) to which such spouse (or the estate of such spouse) is or may be entitled at a purchase price of $100 for all such Unvested Shares. Such purchase shall be effected on the following terms and conditions: 

(i) The Owner’s right to purchase his or her spouse’s interest in the Shares shall continue for a period of 60 days from the date of entry of the divorce decree or from the date of qualification of the personal representative of the spouse in the event of death, as the case may be, and shall be considered exercised by such Owner on the date on which written notice of such exercise has been delivered or mailed, properly addressed, to such spouse or the personal representative of such spouse. 

(ii) If the Owner shall fail to exercise his or her right in its entirety in the manner and time prescribed, then the spouse or the personal representative of the spouse, as the case may be, shall so notify the Company in writing, which notice shall state the address of such spouse or personal representative and the number of Unvested Shares (or interest in Unvested Shares) owned by such spouse or the estate of such spouse. Thereupon the Company shall have the right to purchase all Unvested Shares (and interests therein) not purchased by such Owner for a period of 60 days following the receipt by the Company of such notice at a purchase price of $100 for all such Unvested Shares. 

(iii) The purchase right set forth in this paragraph 17(d) shall terminate with respect to any Shares for which the purchase right is not timely exercised under paragraphs 17(d)(i) and (ii). 

18\. Termination. The Company may terminate the Plan at any time; however, such termination will not modify the terms and conditions of the Award made under this Agreement without the Recipient’s consent. 

19\. No Rights as a Shareholder. Recipient shall have the full right to vote and to receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with

##### 

respect to Vested Shares. With respect to Unvested Shares, (i) the voting power shall be exercised only in accordance with the determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, and such Unvested Shares cannot be voted by the Owner in the absence of such determination; (ii) stock dividends and other stock adjustments shall be treated as provided in Article VII of the Plan; and (iii) cash dividends shall be held by the Company and paid to the Owner at such time as Unvested Shares may become Vested Shares; however, if Unvested Shares revert to the Company as provided in this Agreement, then any such cash dividends shall also become the property of the Company. 

20\. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be severed from the remainder of this Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforced. In addition, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be automatically modified, and, as so modified, to be included in this Agreement, such modification being made to the minimum extent necessary to render the provision valid, legal and enforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the severed or modified provision concerns all or a portion of the essential consideration to be delivered under this Agreement by one party to the other, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall also be modified to the extent necessary to equitably adjust the parties’ respective rights and obligations hereunder. 

21\. Entire Agreement. Except as provided below, this Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules attached hereto, if any (together with the provisions of the Plan), contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereto, and supersedes all prior agreements between them, whether oral or written, of any nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. However, this Agreement does not supersede the Company’s rights under any agreement between Recipient and the Company that (i) protects the Company’s proprietary information or intellectual property, or (ii) prohibits Recipient from competing with the Company or soliciting the Company’s customers, suppliers or employees; rather all such rights of the Company under any such agreements shall be in addition to the rights granted herein. In addition, if the Company and Recipient have entered into a separate agreement concerning arbitration of claims, the Company shall elect, within 10 days of notice from Recipient of a claim to be arbitrated, whether any such arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement or of such separate agreement.
