Addendum 1

To: Dave Wareham

From: HR

Date: April 2, 2009

CC: HR Services

Re: Benefit and Salary Edit

§6.1

Your basic salary will be £200,000 per annum less such tax and NI contributions or other deductions as the Company is obliged or authorised to make.

  


§7.2.1

During your employment you will be entitled at the Company’s expense to participate in the Company’s permanent health insurance scheme; this scheme can be carried over at the end of your employment on a personal basis without any breaks in continuance of cover or any additional underwriting.

  


Under this cover, Open Text will arrange insurance coverage for the treatment for claims in relation to ‘Routine Check for Heart Stent’ under a Discretionary Benefit Option. Claims for the above mentioned treatments will be covered up to £2,000 per quarter. The HM Revenue & Customs (tax office) could view this as additional benefit in kind and therefor Open Text will be required to reflect these payments on your income resulting in a tax liability on any bills paid under the Discretionary Benefit Option, which will be the employee’s responsibility. 

  


Due to the nature of this cover, this particular element (‘Routine Check for Heart Stent’) would be unavailable on an individual basis if employment is terminated; however, the vendor does offer other individual options, which would be available, should employment with Open Text cease.

  


§7.2.2

In the Company Life Assurance scheme providing benefits of four (4) times your annual base salary and 50% of your variable.

Any amounts over this ‘maximum’ may be covered but individuals will need to provide evidence of insurability. As part of this scheme and maximum rule, all employees will need to

undergo further underwriting in order to be covered for payments in excess of £1M.
