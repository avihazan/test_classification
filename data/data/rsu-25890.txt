5\. Other Rules Affecting Your Restricted Stock

(a) Rights During the Restriction Period: During the Restriction Period (and even though the Shares of Restricted Stock are held in escrow until they are settled), you (i) may exercise full voting rights associated with the Shares of Restricted Stock and (ii) will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock, although any dividends or other distributions paid in Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were issued under this Award Agreement. 

(b) Beneficiary Designation: You may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive Restricted Stock that is not settled at the time of your death by completing a Beneficiary Designation Form.

The Beneficiary Designation Form does not need to be completed now and is not required to be completed as a condition of receiving your Restricted Stock.

(c) Tax Withholding:

(i) You may be required to pay to us or a Related Entity and, subject to Code §409A, we or any Related Entity will have the right and are hereby authorized to withhold from any issuance or transfer due under this Award Agreement or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to you, applicable withholding taxes with respect to your Restricted Stock or any issuance or transfer under this Award Agreement or the Plan and to take such action as may be necessary in our opinion to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of Section 5(c)(i), to the extent permitted by the Committee, you may satisfy the foregoing withholding liability: (A) by having us withhold from the number of Shares that otherwise would be issued to you when your

Restricted Stock is settled a number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the statutory minimum withholding liability; or (B) through the delivery or attestation of a number of Shares owned by you for at least six months before the Restricted Stock is settled (or such other period established by generally accepted accounting principles) and that have a Fair Market Value equal to the statutory minimum withholding liability. 

(d) Transferring Your Restricted Stock: In general, your Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, as described in Section 5(b), you may complete a Beneficiary Designation Form to name the person who may receive any Restricted Stock that is settled after you die. Also, with the Committee’s consent, you may be allowed to transfer your Restricted Stock to certain Permissible Transferees (as defined in the Plan). Contact us at the address given on the first page of this Award Agreement if you are interested in transferring your Restricted Stock to a Permissible Transferee.

(f) Other Agreements: Your Restricted Stock will be subject to the terms of any other written agreements between you and us to the extent that those other agreements do not directly conflict with the terms of the Plan or this Award Agreement. 

(g) Adjustments to Your Restricted Stock: If there is a Share dividend, Share split, recapitalization (including payment of an extraordinary dividend), merger, consolidation, combination, spin-off, distribution of assets to stockholders, exchange of Shares or other similar corporate change affecting Shares, the Committee will appropriately adjust the number of Shares of Restricted Stock and any other factors, limits or terms affecting your Restricted Stock. Any decision by the Committee as to the appropriate adjustments to be made to your Restricted Stock will be binding on you. 

(h) Buy Out of Restricted Stock: We may offer to buy for cash or by substitution of another Award (but only to the extent that the offer and the terms of the offer do not, and on their face are not likely to, generate penalties under Code §409A or violate any other applicable law) your Restricted Stock, whether or not the Restriction Period has lapsed, by providing to you written notice (“Buy Out Offer”) of our intention to exercise the rights reserved in Section 15.05 of the Plan and other information, if any, required to be included under applicable securities laws. If a Buy Out Offer is made and you accept it, we will transfer to you the value (determined under procedures adopted by the Committee) of your Restricted Stock to be purchased or exchanged. We will complete any such buy out as soon as administratively feasible after the date you accept the Buy Out Offer. 

(i) Other Terms and Conditions: Your Restricted Stock is subject to the terms and conditions described in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Award Agreement. You should read the Plan carefully to ensure you fully understand all the terms and conditions of your Restricted Stock.
