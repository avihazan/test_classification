Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the board of directors of the Corporation.
