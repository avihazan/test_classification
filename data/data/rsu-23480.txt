Exhibit 10.1

  


APPENDIX A - TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT

FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES

1.Grant. The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan the number of Restricted Stock Units indicated on the first page of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, this Appendix A and the Plan. When Shares are paid to the Employee in payment for the Restricted Stock Units, par value will be deemed paid by the Employee for each Restricted Stock Unit by past services rendered by the Employee and will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings. 

2.Company’s Obligation to Pay. On any date, a Restricted Stock Unit has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units have vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement, the Employee will have no right to payment of the Restricted Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock Units represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. 

3.Vesting Schedule. Except as provided in paragraph 4, and subject to paragraph 5, the Restricted Stock Units subject to this grant will vest as to the number of Restricted Stock Units, and on the dates shown, on the first page of this Agreement. Restricted Stock Units will only vest if the Employee’s Continuous Status as an Employee is not interrupted through the date on which the Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest.

4.Administrator Discretion. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of all or a portion of the Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having been earned (vested) as of the date specified by the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with the interruption of the Employee’s Continuous Status as an Employee (provided that such interruption is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death, and if (x) the Employee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such interruption and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to the Employee on or within the six (6) month period following the interruption of the Employee’s Continuous Status as an Employee, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of such interruption, unless the Employee dies during such six (6) month period, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid to the Employee’s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death, subject to paragraph 8. It is the intent of this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. For purposes of this Agreement, “Section 409A” means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time. 

5.Forfeiture. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the balance of the Restricted Stock Units that have not vested pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4 will be forfeited and cancelled automatically on the first to occur of (a) the date the Employee’s Continuous Status as an Employee is interrupted or (b) the Termination Date set forth on first page of this Agreement. 

6.Payment after Vesting. Subject to paragraph 4, Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in Shares as soon as practicable following the date of vesting, but in each such case no later than the date that is two-and-one-half months from the end of the Company’s tax year that includes the vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and if permitted by the Administrator, the Employee may elect to defer the payout of vested Restricted Stock Units by properly completing and submitting a Restricted Stock Unit Deferral Election to the Company in accordance with the directions on the Election form and such rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, which rules and procedures shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A, unless otherwise expressly determined by the Administrator.

7.Death of the Employee. Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Employee’s estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.

8.Responsibility for Taxes. The Employee acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Parent or Subsidiary employing the Employee (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, fringe benefit tax, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Employee’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Employee (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount to be withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Employee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Employee’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Employee is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Employee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

If any tax withholding is required when Shares are issued as payment for vested Restricted Stock Units or, in the discretion of the Company, at such earlier time as the Tax-Related Items are due, the Company will withhold a portion of the Shares that has an aggregate market value sufficient to pay all Tax-Related Items. In addition and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company (or the Employer) has the right to retain without notice from any fees, salary or other amounts payable to the Employee, cash having a sufficient value to satisfy any Tax-Related Items that the Company determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of otherwise deliverable Shares or that are due prior to the issuance of Shares under the Restricted Stock Unit Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require the Employee to make alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of such Tax-Related Items before they arise. Further, if permissible under applicable local law, the Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit or require the Employee to satisfy the Tax‑Related Items, in whole or in part, by selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion, including through a broker‑assisted arrangement or otherwise, equal to the amount to be withheld (and any associated broker or other fees, as applicable). 

To avoid negative tax consequences, if Tax-Related Items are satisfied by withholding in Shares otherwise issuable, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Employee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. In addition, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, the Employee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no Shares will be issued unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Company) have been made by the Employee with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items that the Company determines must be withheld or collected with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. If the Employee fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax‑Related Items at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise vest pursuant to this Agreement or the terms of the Plan, or at the time any Tax‑Related Items with respect to the Restricted Stock Units otherwise are due, the Employee permanently will forfeit such Restricted Stock Units and any right to receive the Shares thereunder and the Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company.

9.Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee. Except as provided in paragraph 11, after such issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 

10.No Effect on Employment. The Employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at‑will basis only. Accordingly, the terms of the Employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries will be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Employee (as the case may be), and the Company or the Subsidiary will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time.

11.Changes in Shares. In the event that as a result of a dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, reclassification, recapitalization, combination of Shares or the adjustment in capital stock of the Company or otherwise, or as a result of a merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off or other reorganization, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the Restricted Stock Units will be increased, reduced or otherwise changed, as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Award, and by virtue of any such change the Employee will in his capacity as owner of unvested Restricted Stock Units which have been awarded to him (the “Prior Units”) be entitled to new or additional or different restricted stock units, cash, securities (other than rights or warrants to purchase securities) or other property, such new or additional or different restricted stock units, cash, securities or other property will thereupon be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock Units and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Prior Units pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan. If the Employee receives rights or warrants with respect to any Prior Units, such rights or warrants may be held or exercised by the Employee, provided that until such exercise any such rights or warrants and after such exercise any shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants will be considered to be unvested Restricted Stock Units and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Prior Units pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement. The Administrator in its absolute discretion at any time may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of such new or additional units, cash or securities, rights or warrants to purchase securities or shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants.

12.Address for Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of the Company’s Stock Administration Department, at Quantum Corporation, 224 Airport Parkway, Suite 300, San Jose, CA 95110, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

13.Grant is Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in paragraph 7 above, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.

All of Employee’s information that is described or referenced in this Agreement and the Plan may be used by the Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates to administer and manage Employee’s participation in the Plan.

However, an Employee’s subsequent sale of the Shares may be subject to any market blackout-period that may be imposed by the Company and must comply with the Company’s insider trading policies, and any other applicable securities laws.

17.Additional Conditions to Issuance of Certificates for Shares. If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to paragraph 6, such settlement will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.

18.Electronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to this or future grants of Restricted Stock Units by electronic means or to request Employee’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.

19.Plan Governs. This Agreement is subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan.

20.Administrator Authority. The Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Restricted Stock Units have vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon the Employee, the Company, and all other interested persons. No person acting as the Administrator will be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
