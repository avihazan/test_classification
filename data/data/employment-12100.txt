NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the promises and covenants herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1\. Employment Term. The Company and Executive agree that the Company shall employ Executive to perform the duties of an Executive Vice President of the CNA insurance companies for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on March 31, 2007, or such earlier date as of which Executive’s employment is terminated in accordance with Section 6 hereof (the “Term”).

Executive shall report to the CEO. Executive may be elected to and shall serve as a member of the Board of Directors of one or more of the CNA insurance companies, and if so elected Executive agrees to serve on such boards in such capacity without additional compensation and Executive

further agrees to resign any such position on such Boards upon the termination of his employment with the Company for any reason; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require that the shareholders of any company elect Executive to its board of directors. 

(b) Executive shall diligently and to the best of his abilities assume, perform, and discharge the duties and responsibilities of Executive Vice President, Chief Actuary Officer, as well as such other specific duties and responsibilities as the CEO shall assign or designate to Executive from time to time not inconsistent with Executive’s status. Executive shall devote substantially all of his working time to the performance of his duties as set forth herein and shall not, without the prior written consent of the CEO, accept other employment or render or perform other services, nor shall he have any direct or indirect ownership interest in any other business which is in competition with the business of the Company or the CNA insurance companies, other than in the form of publicly traded securities constituting less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of a corporation (determined by vote or value) or limited partnership interests constituting less than five percent (5%) of the value of any such partnership. The foregoing shall not preclude Executive from engaging in charitable, professional, and personal investment activities, provided that, in the judgment of the CEO, such activities do not materially interfere with his performance of his duties and responsibilities hereunder. In addition, the foregoing shall not preclude Executive from spending a portion of his working time performing his duties from Executive’s office in New York during the Term. 

3\. Compensation. 

(a) During the Term, the Company shall initially pay to Executive an annual base salary of $475,000.00 (the “Base Compensation”) and shall, subject to the approval of the Incentive Compensation Committee (“Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company’s parent, CNA Financial Corporation, increase Executive’s Base Compensation to no less than $500,000, effective as of (1) August 1, 2004, if the Agreement is signed by Executive no later than August 18, 2004, or (2) the next pay period after the date the Agreement is signed by Executive, if the Agreement is signed by Executive after August 18, 2004. The Base Compensation shall be payable not less frequently than monthly. At the discretion of the CEO and/or the Committee, such salary rate may be increased annually as of each March occurring during the term of the Agreement, beginning with March 2005, based on market considerations, responsibilities and performance. In no event shall Executive’s salary rate be reduced to an amount that is less than the amount specified in this Section 3(a) without Executive’s written consent, or to an amount that is less than the amount that he was previously receiving without Executive’s written consent.

The amount of the award shall be based on the CEO’s assessment of Executive’s performance, and shall be determined and payable in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Compensation Plan as set forth in the Incentive Compensation Plan documents; however, if Executive is a proxy-named officer, the amount of the award shall be based on the Committee’s assessment of Executive’s performance, and shall be determined and payable in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Compensation Plan, as set forth in the Incentive Compensation Plan documents. Provided, further, that the Committee shall have unlimited negative discretion under the Incentive Compensation Plan to decrease the amount of Executive’s award for any year. 

(c) Subject to Committee approval, Executive shall be eligible to receive a long-term Incentive Cash Award, in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be in effect during the Term or such other long term incentive plan as the Company may from time to time adopt for its senior officers. The Executive’s target long-term incentive cash award shall be no less than 20 percent (20%) of annual base compensation during the three year performance period. In no event shall the target award be reduced without the Executive’s written consent.
