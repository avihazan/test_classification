Employee further agrees from time to time to execute written transfers to Employer of ownership or specific original works or authorship (and all copyrights therein) made by Employee (solely or jointly with others) which may, despite the preceding sentence, be deemed by a court of law not to be “works made for hire” in such form as is acceptable to Employer in its reasonable discretion. Employee hereby waives in favor of Employer and its assigns and licensees any and all artist’s or moral rights Employee may have in respect of any Invention pursuant to any local, state or federal laws or statutes of the United States and all similar rights under the laws of all jurisdictions.

For the avoidance of doubt, Employee will identify on Exhibit 2.4(b) with sufficient detail any intellectual property belonging to the Employee prior to the date hereof, including that related to the business of the Employer (collectively the “Employee's Personal Intellectual Property”). Employer acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Section 2.4(a) shall not apply to Employee’s Personal Intellectual Property or to any inventions (and patent rights with respect thereto), original works of authorship (including all copyrights with respect thereto), developments, improvements, concepts or trade secrets conceived of or developed by Employee during the term of this Agreement that is not Employer Intellectual Property.

The Employee also agrees to make and maintain adequate and reasonable written records customarily maintained by corporate managers, including, without limitation, lists and telephone numbers of persons and companies he has contacted during his engagement by the Employer. Immediately upon the Employer’s request and promptly upon termination of the Employee’s engagement with the Employer, the Employee shall deliver to the Employer all written records as described in this Section, together with all memoranda, notes, records, reports, photographs, drawings, plans, papers, computer storage media, Confidential Information or other documents made or compiled by the Employee or made available to the Employee during the course of his engagement by the Employer, and any copies or abstracts thereof, whether or not of a secret or confidential nature, and all of such records, memoranda or other documents shall, during and after the engagement of the Employee by the Employer, be and shall be deemed to be the property of the Employer.
