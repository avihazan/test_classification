(i) on the date fixed pursuant to ARTICLE II, Section 11 of these Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting, or

A person whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote such stock, unless in the transfer by the pledger on the books of the Corporation he shall have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon. Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

At any meeting of the stockholders all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or bylaw, shall be decided by the vote of majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat and thereon, a quorum being present .

Section 10. Consent of Absentees. The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the stockholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice. All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 

Section 11. Record Date and Closing Stock Books. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive any dividend or distribution or any allotment of rights, or to exercise rights in respect to any change, conversion or exchange of shares. The record date so fixed shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. When a record date is so fixed, only stockholders who are such of record on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution, or allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date. The Board of Directors may close the books of the Corporation against transfers of shares during the whole or any part of a period not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of a stockholdersâ€™ meeting, the date when the right to any dividend, distribution, or allotment of rights vests, or the effective date of any change, conversion or exchange of shares. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

Section 12. Conduct of Meetings. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall have complete authority to establish rules of conduct governing all meetings of stockholders.

Section 13. Business of Meetings. To be properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement or amendment thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) brought before the meeting in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or (iv) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder.

To be timely, a stockholderâ€™s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred thirty-five (135) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than thirty-five (35) daysâ€™ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by a stockholder, to be timely, must be received no later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. A stockholderâ€™s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, Section 13. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, Section 13, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
