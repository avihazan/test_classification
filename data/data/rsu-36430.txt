In such case, the EPS of the acquired company will be determined as of the last available quarter of financial results. The same will be true if a peer company is acquired by another company that is not in the Peer Group. 

The payment of shares pursuant to this Section 2.1 will be made as soon as practicable after the date the Award becomes vested.

3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in the Plan, upon the occurrence of the following events set forth in (a), (b) and (c) below (each an “Acceleration Event”), the Performance Period with respect to the Award shall end on the day prior to the effective date of the Acceleration Event and the Award shall become payable, calculated in accordance with Section 2.1 herein, as of such date: 

(a) if there is consummation by the Company of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a merger other than a sale or merger involving a company in which the shareholders of the Company, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially own (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Act) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities immediately following such transaction;   
  
(b) individuals who, as of the date of this Agreement, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date of this Agreement whose election or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the Directors of the Company (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Act); or   
  
(c) the acquisition from Sunil A. Wadhwani and/or Ashok K.

SECTION 4: Miscellaneous

4.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Grantee hereby agrees to take any action, and consents to the taking of any action by the Corporation, with respect to the Award hereunder necessary to achieve compliance with applicable laws or regulations in effect from time to time. Any determination by the Committee with respect to the need for any action in order to achieve such compliance with laws or regulations shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Corporation shall in no event be obligated to register any securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (as the same shall be in effect from time to time) or to take any other affirmative action in order to cause the Award under the Plan, the lapsing of restrictions thereon or the delivery of certificates therefore to comply with any law or regulation in effect from time to time. 

4.2 Where required by law, no later than the date of payment of the Award, the Grantee shall pay to the Corporation an amount sufficient to allow the Corporation to satisfy its tax withholding obligations applicable to the Award. To this end, the Grantee shall either: 

(a) pay the Corporation the amount of tax to be withheld in cash;   
  
(b) deliver to the Corporation other shares of Stock owned by the Grantee prior to such date having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date on which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined which does not exceed the amount of tax required to be withheld (based on the statutory minimum withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes), provided that the previously owned shares delivered in satisfaction of the withholding obligations must have been held by the participant for at least six (6) months;   
  
(c) make a payment to the Corporation consisting of a combination of both (a) and (b) above; or   
  
(d) request that the Corporation cause to be withheld a number of shares of Stock otherwise due the Grantee hereunder having a Fair Market Value on the date on which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined which does not exceed the amount of tax required to be withheld (based on the statutory minimum withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes); provided, however, that shares may be withheld by the Corporation only if such withheld shares have vested).   
  
Grantee understands that no shares of Stock shall be delivered to Grantee, notwithstanding the vesting thereof, unless and until Grantee shall have satisfied any obligation for withholding taxes with respect thereto as provided herein. 

4.3 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Subsidiary” means any corporation or other entity (other than the Corporation) in any unbroken chain of corporations or other entities, beginning with the Corporation, if each of the corporations or entities (other than the last corporation

4.4 Grantee hereby indemnifies the Corporation and holds it harmless from and against any and all damages or liabilities incurred by the Corporation (including liabilities for attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising out of any breach by Grantee of this Agreement. 

4.5 Nothing herein shall be construed as giving Grantee any right to be retained in the employ of the Corporation or affect any right which the Corporation may have to terminate the employment of such Grantee. 

4.6 This Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms of the Plan, as amended and interpreted from time to time by the Plan Administrator; provided however, that no alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the Plan shall, without the written consent of Grantee, adversely affect the rights of Grantee with respect to the Award. Should there be any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the provisions in the Plan shall govern. 

4.7 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, other than any choice of law provisions calling for the application of laws of another jurisdiction.
