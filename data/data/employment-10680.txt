Executive will perform such duties, and exercise such supervision and control, as are commonly associated with Executive’s position, as well as perform such other duties as are reasonably assigned to Executive. Executive will devote substantially all of Executive’s business time and energy to Executive’s duties. Executive will maintain operations in Executive’s area of responsibility, and make every reasonable effort to ensure that the employees within that area of responsibility act, in compliance with applicable law and UnitedHealth Group’s Code of Conduct, as amended from time to time.

C.

Equity Awards. Executive will be eligible for stock-based awards in UnitedHealth Group’s discretion. In accordance with guideline amounts authorized by UnitedHealth Group’s Compensation and Human Resources Committee, management will recommend that, in connection with the annual grant process in February, 2013, Executive be awarded equity compensation in the form of (i) Restricted Stock Units with a value of $1,000,000, (ii) Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units with a value of $1,000,000, at target for the performance period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, and (iii) Non-Qualified Stock Options (Options) with a Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) value of $1,000,000.

Accordingly, Executive’s recommended grant will be reviewed by the Committee at its next regularly scheduled quarterly meeting following the Effective Date. The number of shares comprising the Options award will be calculated the day of the Committee meeting using the closing price of UnitedHealth Group stock on that day that the calculation is made. The actual grant price of the Options award will be the closing price of UnitedHealth Group stock on the day of the Committee meeting. The number of shares comprising the recommended restricted stock grant will be calculated the day of the Committee meeting using the closing price of UnitedHealth Group stock on that day.

Executive will be eligible for Paid Time Off in accordance with UnitedHealth Group’s policies. UnitedHealth Group reserves the right to amend or discontinue any plan or policy at any time in its sole discretion. In addition to the Company’s generally available benefits, UnitedHealth Group shall provide Executive, at UnitedHealth Group’s expense during the term of Executive’s employment, a $2 million face value term life insurance policy and a long term disability policy which covers 60% of base salary in the event of a qualifying long term disability, subject to the policy terms.

In any instance where the Company may have grounds for Cause, failure by the Company to provide written notice of the grounds for Cause within 120 days of discovery shall be a waiver of its right to assert the subject conduct as a basis for termination for Cause.   
  
  
  
  
D.

By Executive without Good Reason. Executive may terminate Executive’s employment at any time for any reason, including due to Executive’s retirement.

* * *

  


  


such circumstances, or such circumstances will not constitute Good Reason. If the circumstances constituting Good Reason are reasonably capable of being remedied, UnitedHealth Group will have 60 days to remedy such circumstances. “Good Reason” will exist if UnitedHealth Group takes any of the following actions, without Executive’s consent: (a) reduces Executive’s base salary or target bonus percentage other than in connection with a general reduction affecting a group of employees; (b) moves Executive’s primary work location more than 50 miles; (c) makes changes that substantially diminish Executive’s duties or responsibilities; or (d) changes the Executive’s reporting relationship.   
  
F.

Due to Executive’s Death or Disability. Executive’s employment will terminate automatically if Executive dies, effective as of the date of Executive’s death. UnitedHealth Group may terminate Executive’s employment due to Executive’s disability that renders Executive incapable of performing the essential functions of Executive’s job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Executive will not be entitled to Severance Benefits under Section 4 in the event of termination due to Executive’s death or disability.  
  
4.

Severance Benefits.   
  
A.

Circumstances under Which Severance Benefits Payable. Executive will be entitled to Severance Benefits only if Executive’s employment is terminated by UnitedHealth Group without Cause or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason. Whether Executive has had a termination of employment will be determined in a manner consistent with the definition of “Separation from Service” under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and its accompanying regulations (“Section 409A”) and will be referred to herein as a “Termination.” For purposes of this Agreement, Executive will be considered to have experienced a Termination as of the date that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably anticipated that Executive will provide no further services after such date or that the level of bona fide services that Executive is expected to perform permanently decreases to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services that Executive performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period In consideration of the Severance Benefits in this Agreement, Executive waives any payments or benefits to which Executive otherwise might be or become entitled under any UnitedHealth Group severance plan or program.  
  
B.

Severance Benefits. Subject to Section 4.C, Executive shall be entitled to the following Severance Benefits if Executive experiences a Termination under the circumstances described in Section 4.A above:  
  
(i) Two times Executive’s annualized base salary as of Executive’s Termination.

* * *

  


  


(ii) Any bonus or incentive compensation paid or payable to Executive for the two most recent calendar years (excluding equity-related awards, payments under any long-term or similar benefit plan, or any other special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments); provided, however, that if termination occurs within two years following the Effective Date, the amount payable under this paragraph will be two times Executive’s target incentive. 

(iii) $12,000 lump sum payment, minus applicable deductions, to offset costs of COBRA, which amount will be paid within 60 days following Termination. 

(iv) Outplacement services consistent with those provided to similarly situated executives provided by an outplacement firm selected by UnitedHealth Group. 

The Severance Benefits in Sections 4.B.(i)-(ii) will be paid out, minus applicable deductions, including deductions for tax withholding, in equal bi-weekly payments on the regular payroll cycle over the 24-month period following Executive’s Termination. Commencement of payments shall begin on the first payroll date that is at least 60 days after the date of Executive’s Termination (the “Starting Date”), provided that Executive has satisfied the requirement in Section 4.C. The first payment on the Starting Date shall include those payments that would have been previously paid if the payments of the severance compensation had begun on the first payroll date following the date of Executive’s Termination. Executive’s entitlement to the payments of the severance compensation described in Sections 4.B(i)-(ii) shall be treated as the entitlement to a series of separate payments for purposes of Section 409A. 

If Executive is a “Specified Employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A and determined pursuant to procedures adopted by UnitedHealth Group) at the time of Executive’s Termination and any amount that would be paid to Executive during the six-month period following Termination constitutes “Deferred Compensation” (within the meaning of Section 409A), such amount shall not be paid to Executive until the later of (i) six months after the date of Executive’s Termination, and (ii) the payment date or commencement date specified in this Agreement for such payment(s). On the first regular payroll date following the expiration of such six-month period (or if Executive dies during the six-month period, the first payroll date following the death), all payments that were delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid to Executive in a single lump sum and thereafter all payments shall be made as if there had been no such delay. All Severance Benefits described in Section 4.B shall be paid by, and no further severance compensation shall be paid or payable after, December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which Executive’s Termination occurs.  
  
C.

Separation Agreement and Release Required. In order to receive any Severance Benefits under this Agreement, Executive must timely sign a separation agreement   
  
  


5

* * *

  


  


and release of claims in a form determined by UnitedHealth Group in its discretion. UnitedHealth Group shall provide to Executive a form of separation agreement and release of claims no later than three (3) days following Executive’s date of Termination. If Executive does not timely execute and deliver to UnitedHealth Group such separation agreement and release, or if Executive does so, but then revokes it if permitted by and within the time required by applicable law, UnitedHealth Group will have no obligation to pay severance compensation to Executive.
