1.

(a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the Company agrees to employ the employee in a management position with the Company, and the Employee agrees to remain in the employment of the Company in that capacity for a period of one year from the date hereof and from year to year thereafter until such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Paragraph 5.

The Company will, during each year of the term of this Agreement, place in nomination before the Board of Directors of the Company the name of the Employee for election as an Officer of the Company except when a notice of termination has been given in accordance with Paragraph 5(b).  
  
2.

The Employee agrees that, during the specified period of employment, he shall, to the best of his ability, perform his duties, and shall devote his full business time, best efforts, business judgment, skill and knowledge to the advancement of the Company and its interests and to the discharge of his duties and responsibilities hereunder.

(b)

He shall be reimbursed for any and all monies expended by him in connection with his employment for reasonable and necessary expenses on behalf of the Company in accordance with the policies of the Company then in effect;  
  
(c)

He shall be eligible to participate under any and all bonus, benefit, pension, compensation, and equity and incentive plans which are, in accordance with Company policy and the terms of the plan, available to persons in his position (within the limitation as stipulated by such plans). Such eligibility shall not automatically entitle him to participate in any such plan;  
  
(d)

If, because of adverse business conditions or for other reasons, the Company at any time puts into effect salary reductions applicable at a single rate to all management employees of the Company generally, the salary payments required to be made under this Agreement to the Employee during any period in which such general reduction is in effect may be reduced by the same percentage as is applicable to all management employees of the Company generally. Any benefits made available to the Employee which are related to base salary shall also be reduced in accordance with any salary reduction.  
  
4.

(a) So long as the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of one year after the termination or expiration of employment, the Employee will not directly or indirectly: (i) as an individual proprietor, partner, stockholder, officer, employee, director, joint venturer, investor, lender, or in any other capacity whatsoever (other than as the holder of not more than one percent (1%) of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held company), engage directly or indirectly in any business or entity which competes with the business conducted by the Company or its affiliates in any city or geographic area in which the Company or its affiliates conduct material operations at the time of termination of employment under this Agreement, except as approved in advance by the Board after full and adequate disclosure; or (ii) recruit, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any employee or employees or consultant or consultants of the Company to terminate their employment with, to otherwise cease their relationship with, the Company; or (iii) solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away, the business or patronage of any of the clients, customers or accounts, of the Company.  
  
(b)

If any restriction set forth in this Paragraph 4 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographical area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.  
  
(c)

The restrictions contained in this Paragraph 4 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. The Employee agrees that any breach of this Paragraph 4 will cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies

(e)

Twelve months after written notice of termination (a “Disability Termination Notice”) is given by the Company to the Employee based on a determination by the Board of Directors that the Employee is disabled (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean that the Employee is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, with such determination to be made by the Board of Directors, in reliance upon the opinion of the Employee’s physician or upon the opinion of one or more physicians selected by the Company). A Disability Termination Notice shall be deemed properly delivered if given by the Company to the Employee on the 180th day of continuous disability of the Employee.

During the twelve-month period following proper delivery of a Disability Termination Notice as aforesaid, the Company will make monthly payments to the Employee in an amount equal to the difference between his base salary and the benefits provided by the Company’s Long-Term Disability Plan. If any payments to the Employee under the Company’s Long-Term Disability Plan are not subject to federal income taxes, the payments to be made directly by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced such that the total amount received by the Employee (from the Company and from the Long-Term Disability Plan), after payment of any income taxes, is equal to the amount that the Employee would have received had he been paid his base salary, after payment of any income taxes on such base salary.  
  
(f)

This Agreement has been executed and delivered and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Agreement is and shall be binding on the respective legal representatives or successors of the parties, but shall not be assignable except to a successor to the Company by virtue of a merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

(e)

The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement to the Employee, and the amount of in-kind benefits provided to the Employee, during any calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year;
