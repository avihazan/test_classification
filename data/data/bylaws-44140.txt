OF

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

OF

MEDTRONIC, INC.

Pursuant to the provisions of Minnesota Statues, Chapter 302A, the following amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of Medtronic, Inc. was duly adopted by the shareholders on August 23, 2007:

Section 5.3 of the Articles of Incorporation has been amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

5.3 Election of the Board of Directors. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than three nor more than fifteen persons, who need not be shareholders. The number of directors may be increased by the shareholders or Board of Directors or decreased by the shareholders from the number of directors on the Board of Directors immediately prior to the effective date of this Section 5.3 provided, however, that any change in the number of directors on the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, changes at annual meetings of shareholders) shall be approved by the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding voting shares (as defined in Section 6.2 of Article 6), voting together as a single class, unless such change shall have been approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. If such change shall not have been so approved, the number of directors shall remain the same. 

Commencing with the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders and thereafter at each annual meeting of shareholders, directors whose term of office is then expiring shall be elected annually for terms of one year and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders. In this regard, directors elected at the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders shall hold office until the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders; directors elected at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders shall hold office until the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders; and directors elected at the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders shall hold office until the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders. In all cases, a director shall hold office until a successor shall be elected and qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Removal of a director from office (including a director named by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship), with or without cause, shall require the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding voting shares, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors

that results from an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next election of directors and until his or her successor shall be elected and have qualified. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes of preferred or preference stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by or pursuant to the applicable terms of the certificate of designation or other instrument creating such class or series of preferred stock.

Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.3 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.3. Nominations by shareholders shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 50 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting, provided, however, that in the event that less than 60 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder’s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation’s books, of such shareholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder. At the request of the Board of Directors any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth

in a shareholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.3. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 5.3 and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. 

At any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the corporation who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.3. For business to be properly brought before any regular or special meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 50 days nor (except for shareholder proposals subject to Rule 14a-8(a)(3)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) more than 90 days prior to the meeting, provided, however, that in the event that less than 60 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to the shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the regular or special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. A shareholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the regular or special meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation’s books, of the shareholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the corporation’s Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any regular or special meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.3. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding voting shares, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, this Section 5.3.

5.2

Elimination of Director Liability in Certain Circumstances. No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided, however that this Article 5, Section 5.2 shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under section 302A.559 or 80A.23 of the Minnesota Statutes, (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit, or (v) for any act or omission occurring prior to the effective date of this Article 5, Section 5.2.

5.3

Classification of the Board of Directors. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than three nor more than fifteen persons, who need not be shareholders. The number of directors may be increased by the shareholders or Board of Directors or decreased by the shareholders from the number of directors on the Board of Directors immediately prior to the effective date of this Section 5.3 provided, however, that any change in the number of directors on the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, changes at annual meetings of shareholders) shall be approved by the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding voting shares (as defined in Section 6.2 of Article 6), voting together as a single class, unless such change shall have been approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  
  
At the 1989 annual meeting of shareholders, Class I directors shall be elected for a one-year term, Class II directors for a two-year term and Class III directors for a three-year term. At each succeeding annual meeting of shareholders beginning in 1990, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the

2

  


* * *

  


number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. In no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which the director’s term expires and until a successor shall be elected and qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Removal of a director from office (including a director named by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship), with or without cause, shall require the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding voting shares, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of such director’s predecessor.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes of preferred or preference stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by or pursuant to the applicable terms of the certificate of designation or other instrument creating such class or series of preferred stock, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Section 5.3 unless expressly provided by such terms.

Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.3 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.3.

At the request of the Board of Directors any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in a shareholder’s notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.

A commercial bank, broker or dealer or insurance company which in the ordinary course of business is a pledgee of voting shares of the corporation under a written pledge agreement shall not be deemed to be the beneficial owner of such pledged voting shares until the pledgee has taken all formal steps necessary to declare a default and determines that the power to vote or to direct the vote or to dispose or to direct the disposition of such pledged securities will be exercised, provided that the pledge agreement is bona fide and was not entered into with the purpose nor with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the corporation nor in connection with  
  
8

  


* * *

  


any transaction having such purpose or effect and, prior to default, does not grant to the pledgee the power to vote or to direct the vote of the pledged voting shares of the corporation; and

6.3

For the purposes of this Article 6, the Continuing Directors by a majority vote shall have the power to make a good faith determination, on the basis of information known to them, of: (a) the number of voting shares of the corporation that any person or entity “beneficially owns,” (b) whether a person or entity is an Affiliate or Associate of another, (c) whether the assets subject to any Related Person Business Transaction constitute a Substantial Part, (d) whether any business transaction is one in which a Related Person has an interest, (e) whether the cash or fair market value of the property, securities or other consideration to be received per share by holders of Common Stock of the corporation other than the Related Person in a Related Person Business Transaction is an amount at least equal to the Highest Purchase Price, and (f) such other matters with respect to which a determination is required under this Article 6.
