b)

Non-Competition. In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, those involving the Confidential Information, compensation and termination, and in order to protect the Confidential Information and to reduce the likelihood of irreparable damage that would occur in the event the Confidential Information is provided to or used by a competitor of the Company, the Employee agrees that during the Term and for an additional period of twelve (6) months immediately following the Term (collectively the “Non-Competition Period”), not to engage in any Competitive Activity.

Therefore, in furtherance of, and not in derogation of the provisions of this Section 6(b), the Company and the Employee agree that in the event a court should decline to enforce the provisions of this Section 6(b), that this Section 6(b) shall be deemed to be modified or reformed to restrict the Employee’s competition with the Company or its affiliates to the maximum extent, as to time, geography and business scope, that the court shall find enforceable; provided, however, in no event shall the provisions of this Section 6(b) be deemed to be more restrictive to the Employee than those contained herein
