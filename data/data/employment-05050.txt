PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. THIS AGREEMENT DESCRIBES THE BASIC LEGAL AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE AS AN EXECUTIVE EXPOSED TO HIGHLY SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY AND STRATEGIC INFORMATION. CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL IF ALL THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY YOU. 

THIS AGREEMENT is made as of the 3rd day of January, 2006, by and between SYKES ENTERPRISES, INCORPORATED, a Florida corporation (the “Company”), and LAWRENCE ZINGALE (the “Executive”). 

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of the Executive’s continued employment in an executive capacity; and 

WHEREAS, the Executive desires to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows: 

1. EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall employ the Executive during the Term (as hereinafter defined) in such executive management capacities as may be designated from time to time by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and/or the Chief Executive Officer’s designee. The Executive accepts such employment and agrees to devote his/her best efforts and entire business time, skill, labor, and attention to the performance of such duties. The Executive agrees to promptly provide a description of any other material commercial duties or pursuits engaged in by the Executive to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. If the Company’s Chief Executive Officer determines in good faith that such activities conflict with the Executive’s performance of his/her duties hereunder, the Chief Executive Officer shall notify Executive within thirty (30) days and the Executive shall promptly cease such activities to the extent as directed by the Chief Executive Officer. If the Chief Executive Officer does not provide such notice, Executive shall be free to engage in such commercial duties or pursuits. It is acknowledged and agreed that such description shall be made regarding any such activities in which the Executive owns more than 5% of the ownership of the organization or which may be in violation of Section 5 hereof, and that the intentional failure of the Executive to provide any such description shall enable the Company to terminate the Executive for Cause (as provided in Section 7(c) hereof). The Company agrees to hold any such information provided by the Executive confidential and not disclose the same to any person other than a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in light of the circumstances. In addition, the Executive agrees to serve without

additional compensation if elected or appointed to any office or position, including as a director, of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; provided, however, that the Executive shall be entitled to receive such benefits and additional compensation, if any, that is paid to executive officers of the Company in connection with such service. 

2\. TERM. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the provisions for termination set forth in Section 7 hereof, the employment of the Executive under this Agreement shall commence on the effective date hereof and shall continue until terminated as provided herein (such term shall herein be defined as the “Term”). The Executive agrees that some portions of this Agreement, including the Sections entitled “Confidential Information,” “Covenant Not-To-Compete And No Solicitation,” “Termination,” and “Arbitration of Disputes,” will remain in force after the termination of this Agreement. 

3\. COMPENSATION.

(a) Base Salary and Bonus. As compensation for the Executive’s services under this Agreement, the Executive shall receive and the Company shall pay a weekly base salary set forth on Exhibit “A”. Such base salary may be increased but not decreased during the Term in the Company’s discretion based upon the Executive’s performance and any other factors the Company deems relevant. Such base salary shall be payable in accordance with the policy then prevailing for the Company’s executives. In addition to such base salary, the Executive shall be entitled during the Term to a performance bonus and shall be eligible to participate in and receive payments or awards from all other bonus and other incentive compensation, stock option and restricted stock plans as may be adopted by the Company, all as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Executive shall also be entitled to receive the benefits set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto. 

(b) Payments. All amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to withholding or deduction by reason of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, federal income tax, state and local income tax, if any, and comparable laws and regulations. 

(c) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company for all reasonable and customary travel and other business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder in accordance with the Company’s standard policy regarding expense verification practices. The Executive shall be entitled to that number of weeks paid vacation per year that is available to other executive officers of the Company in accordance with the Company’s standard policy regarding vacations and such other fringe benefits as may be set forth on Exhibit “A” and shall be eligible to participate in such pension, life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, and other executive benefits plans, if any, which the Company may from time to time make available to its executive officers generally. The Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for relocation expenses and a signing bonus as set forth in Exhibit “B.”

4\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

(a) The Executive has acquired and will acquire information and knowledge respecting the intimate and confidential affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, confidential information with respect to the Company’s technical data, research and development projects, methods, products, software, financial data, business plans, financial plans, customer lists, business methodology, processes, production methods and techniques, promotional materials and information, and other similar matters treated by the Company as confidential (the “Confidential Information”). Accordingly, the Executive covenants and agrees that during the Executive’s employment by the Company (whether during the Term hereof or otherwise) and thereafter, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose to any person, other than a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of the Executive’s duties hereunder, any Confidential Information obtained by the Executive while in the employ of the Company. 

(b) The Executive agrees that all memoranda; notes; records; papers or other documents; computer disks; computer, video or audio tapes; CD-ROMs; all other media and all copies thereof relating to the Company’s operations or business, some of which may be prepared by the Executive; and all objects associated therewith in any way obtained by the Executive shall be the Company’s property. This shall include, but is not limited to, documents; computer disks; computer, video and audio tapes; CD-ROMs; all other media and objects concerning any technical data, methods, products, software, research and development projects, financial data, financial plans, business plans, customer lists, contracts, price lists, manuals, mailing lists, advertising materials; and all other materials and records of any kind that may be in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. The Executive shall not, except for the Company’s use, copy or duplicate any of the aforementioned documents or objects, nor remove them from the Company’s facilities, nor use any information concerning them except for the Company’s benefit, either during the Executive’s employment or thereafter. The Executive covenants and agrees that the Executive will deliver all of the aforementioned documents and objects, if any, that may be in the Executive’s possession to the Company upon termination of the Executive’s employment, or at any other time at the Company’s request. 

(c) In any action to enforce or challenge these Confidential Information provisions, the prevailing party is entitled to recover his or its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. 

5\. COVENANT NOT-TO-COMPETE AND NO SOLICITATION. Executive recognizes that the Company is in the business of employing individuals to provide specialized and technical services to the Company’s Clients. The purpose of these Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions are to protect the relationship which exists between the Company and its Clients while Executive is employed and after Executive leaves the employ of the Company. The consideration for these Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions is the Executive’s employment with the Company.

Agreement containing Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions is reasonable to protect the Company’s business relationship with its Clients. 

(c) Restrictions on Executive. During the Term of this Agreement and for the greater of one (1) year or such other period during which Executive may receive Liquidated Damages hereunder, after the termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, whether such termination was by the Company or the Executive, voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether with or without cause, Executive agrees that he/she shall not, as a principal, employer, stockholder, partner, agent, consultant, independent contractor, employee, or in any other individual or representative capacity: 

(1) Directly or indirectly engage in, continue in, or carry on the business of the Company or any business substantially similar thereto, including owning or controlling any financial interest in any corporation, partnership, firm, or other form of business organization which competes with or is engaged in or carries on any aspect of such business or any business substantially similar thereto; 

(2) Consult with, advise, or assist in any way, whether or not for consideration of any kind, any corporation, partnership, firm, or other business organization which is now, becomes, or may become a competitor of the Company in any aspect of the Company’s business during the Executive’s employment with the Company, including, but not limited to, advertising or otherwise endorsing the products of any such competitor or loaning money or rendering any other form of financial assistance to or engaging in any form of transaction whether or not on an arm’s length basis with any such competitor; 

(3) Provide or attempt to provide or solicit the opportunity to provide or advise others of the opportunity to provide any services of the type Executive performed for the Company or the Company’s Clients (regardless of whether and how such services are to be compensated, whether on a salaried, time and materials, contingent compensation, or other basis) to or for the benefit of any Client (i) to which Executive has provided services in any capacity on behalf of the Company, or (ii) to which Executive has been introduced to or about which the Executive has received information through the Company or through any Client from which Executive has performed services in any capacity on behalf of the Company;

(5) Engage in any practice, subsequent to termination of this Agreement, the purpose of which is to evade the provisions of this Agreement or to commit any act which is detrimental to the successful continuation of or which adversely affects the business or the Company; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 (c) shall not preclude the Executive’s enforcement of his rights under this Agreement or the Executive’s ownership of not more than 2% of the equity securities of a company whose securities are registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

(6) For purpose of these Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions, Client includes any subsidiaries, affiliates, customers, and clients of the Company’s Clients that directly or indirectly engage in, continue in, or carry on the business of the Company or any business substantially similar thereto. Provided that, Executive will not be deemed to be in violation of these Covenant Not-to-Compete provisions if Executive’s business activities are not related to the business of the Company or any business substantially similar thereto. The Executive agrees that the geographic scope of this Covenant Not-to-Compete shall extend to the geographic area where the Company’s Clients conduct business at any time during the Term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “Clients” means any person or entity to which the Company provides or has provided within a period of one (1) year prior to the Executive’s termination of employment, labor, materials or services for the furtherance of such entity’s or person’s business or any person or entity that within such period of one (1) year the Company has pursued or communicated with for the purpose of obtaining business for the Company. 

(d) Enforcement. These Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions shall be construed and enforced under the laws of the State of Florida.

In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the provisions of this Covenant Not-to-Compete are excessively broad as to duration, geographic scope, prohibited activities or otherwise, the parties agree that this covenant shall be reduced or curtailed only to the extent necessary to render it enforceable. 

(e) In an action to enforce or challenge these Covenant Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions, the prevailing party is entitled to recover his or its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

6\. EXECUTIVE’S REPRESENTATIONS. Executive represents and warrants that he is not bound by the terms of any non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality agreement other than those remaining from his Executive Agreement with Executive’s prior employer (the “Prior Employer”) and Confidential Severance Agreement and General Release (“Severance Agreement”) with the Prior Employer executed on August 31, 2005. Executive represents and warrants that by virtue of his employment with the Company, he will not violate the terms of his Executive Agreement or Severance Agreement with the Prior Employer and that he will perform his assigned duties for the Company without reference to confidential or proprietary information of the Prior Employer and without soliciting those which were the Prior Employer’s customers as of September 30, 2005, through the restricted period as defined in the Severance Agreement. Executive agrees to inform the Company if he believes that any of his assigned duties cannot be performed without violating the terms of the Severance Agreement so that the Company may take such actions as are necessary to avoid such violation. 

7\. TERMINATION

(a) Death. The Executive’s employment hereunder shall terminate upon his/her death. 

(b) Disability. If during the Term of this Agreement the Executive becomes physically or mentally disabled in accordance with the terms and conditions of any disability insurance policy covering the Executive, or, if due to such physical or mental disability the Executive becomes unable for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months to perform his/her duties hereunder on substantially a full-time basis as determined by the Company in its sole reasonable discretion, the Company may, at its option, terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder upon not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice so long as the terms of any disability insurance policy then in effect provide for Executive to receive disability payments from that date forward. 

(c) Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder for Cause effective immediately upon notice. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have “Cause” to terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder: (i) if the Executive engages in conduct which has caused or is reasonably likely to cause demonstrable and serious injury to Company; (ii) if the Executive is convicted of a felony as evidenced by a binding and final judgment, order, or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) for the Executive’s failure or refusal to perform his/her material duties or responsibilities hereunder as reasonably determined by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer in good faith, if such failure or refusal continues for a period of ten (10) days after written notice of the same to the Executive; (iv) for gross incompetence; (v) for the Executive’s material violation of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 5 hereof; (vi) for chronic unexcused absenteeism; (vii) for use of illegal drugs; (viii) for insobriety by the Executive while performing his or her duties

hereunder; and (ix) for any act of dishonesty or falsification of reports, records, or information submitted by the Executive to the Company. 

(d) Termination by the Company for Convenience. Subject to the Company’s obligation to pay Liquidated Damages in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company may terminate Executive’s employment hereunder at any time, for the Company’s convenience and without reason, by delivering written notice of termination to the Executive. 

(e) Payments Upon Termination. In the event of a termination of the Executive’s employment, all payments and Company benefits to the Executive hereunder, except the payment of Liquidated Damages (if any) provided below, shall immediately cease and terminate. In the event the Company terminates the Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof, the Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the Liquidated Damages defined in this Section 7(fe) in lieu of actual damages for such termination. If the Executive’s employment terminates or is terminated for any reason other than as specified in the preceding sentence, the Executive shall not be entitled to any Liquidated Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, and in addition to any other compensation which the Executive may be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive shall receive all compensation and other benefits to which he/she was entitled under this Agreement or otherwise as an executive of the Company through the termination date. The “Liquidated Damages” amount, if due as provided above, shall be equal to the weekly amount stated as Base Salary on Exhibit “A” for fifty two (52) weeks. The amount of Liquidated Damages shall be paid biweekly in equal installments over such period. 

(f) Condition Precedent to Receipt of Liquidated Damages. Executive expressly agrees that in the event of a termination of this Agreement, Executive will execute an agreement containing waiver and release provisions in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Executive agrees and acknowledges that the execution of such an agreement upon termination of employment is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Company to pay any Liquidated Damages hereunder. Executive acknowledges that the waiver and release provisions required by the Company will provide for the release and waiver of important rights and/or claims that Executive might have against the Company at the time of termination of this Agreement. 

8\. NOTICE. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when hand-delivered, sent by telecopier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means of transmitting written documents (as long as receipt is acknowledged) or mailed by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

9\. ENFORCEMENT AND GOVERNING LAW. It is stipulated that a breach by Executive of the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to Company or its Clients, and that in the event of any breach of those provisions, Company is entitled to injunctive relief restraining Executive from violating or continuing a violation of the restrictive covenants as well as other remedies it may have. Additionally, such covenants shall be enforceable against the Executive’s heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives, and enforceable by Company’s successors or assigns. 

The validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Florida. Any litigation to enforce this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts of Hillsborough County, Florida, which is the principal place of business for Company and which is considered to be the place where this Agreement is made. Both parties hereby consent to such courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over them. 

10\. ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.

(a) Duty to Arbitrate. Except for any claim by the Company for injunctive relief to enforce the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 5 above, Company and Executive agree to resolve by binding arbitration any claim or controversy arising out of or related to Executive’s employment by Company or this Agreement, to include all matters directly or indirectly related to your recruitment, employment or termination of employment by the Company including, but not limited to claims involving laws against discrimination whether brought under federal and/or state law, and/or claims involving co-employees but excluding workers compensation claims, whether such claim is based in contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory, including any claim for damages, equitable relief, or both. The duty to arbitrate under this Section extends to any claim by or against any officer, director, shareholder, employee, agent, representative, parent, subsidiary, affiliate, heir, trustee, legal representative, successor, or assign of either party making or defending any claim that would otherwise be arbitrable under this Section. However, this Section shall not be interpreted to preclude either party from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive relief, solely to preserve the status quo pending arbitration of the claim or controversy, upon a proper showing of the need for such relief.

(b) The Arbitrator. A single arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in Tampa, Florida, U.S.A., in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “Rules”), and judgment upon the written award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the application of the Rules, however, discovery in the arbitration, including interrogatories, requests for production, requests for admission, and depositions, will be fully available and governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The parties may agree upon a person to act as sole arbitrator within thirty (30) days after submission of any claim or controversy to arbitration pursuant to this Section. If the parties are unable to agree upon such a person within such time period, an arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the Rules. The parties will pay their own respective attorneys’ fees, witness fees, and other costs and expenses incurred in any investigations, arbitrations, trials, bankruptcies, and appeals; provided, however, that the Company will pay the filing fees, hearing fees, and processing fees associated with arbitration hereunder. 

(c) Limitations Period. The parties agree that any claim or controversy that would be arbitrable under this Section must be submitted to arbitration within one (1) year after the claim or controversy arises and that a failure to institute arbitration proceedings within such time period shall constitute an absolute bar to the institution of any proceedings, in arbitration or in any court, and a waiver of all such claims. This Section will survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement. 

(d) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in its construction, interpretation, and performance by the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to law pertaining to conflict of laws. However, the Federal Arbitration Act, as amended, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. 

(e) Attorneys’ Fees. The prevailing party in any arbitration or dispute, or in any litigation, arising out of or related to Executive’s employment by Company or this Agreement, shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred on all levels and in all proceedings, unless otherwise provided by law. 

(f) Severability. Each part of this Section is severable. A holding that any part of this Section is unenforceable will not affect the duty to arbitrate under this Section. 

11\. MISCELLANEOUS. No provision of this Agreement may be modified or waived unless such waiver or modification is agreed to in writing signed by the parties hereto; provided, however, that the terms of the performance bonus and fringe benefits set forth on Exhibit “A” may be amended by the Company  in its discretion without the Executive’s consent to the extent provided therein. . No waiver by any party hereto of any breach by any other party hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar term or condition at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the Executive’s employment by the Company and there are no agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied, with respect to or related to the employment of the Executive which are not set forth in this Agreement. Any prior agreement

relating to the Executive’s employment with the Company is hereby superseded and void, and is no longer in effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its respective successors and assigns, and the Executive and his/her heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. Except as expressly set forth herein, no party shall assign any of his/her or its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party and any attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void and without legal effect; provided, however, that Company may assign this Agreement to any party that acquires all or substantially all of Company’s assets or business, without Executive’s consent. The parties agree that if any provision of this Agreement shall under any circumstances be deemed invalid or inoperative, the Agreement shall be construed with the invalid or inoperative provision deleted and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement has been negotiated and no party shall be considered as being responsible for such drafting for the purpose of applying any rule construing ambiguities against the drafter or otherwise. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
