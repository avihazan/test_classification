EXHIBIT 10.1



THIS AGREEMENT, made this 27 day of January 2012, is by and between Vascular Solutions, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), and Howard C. Root, a resident of the State of Minnesota (the "Employee").

WHEREAS, Employee and the Company have previously entered into an employment relationship; and

WHEREAS, Employee and the Company desire to amend and supercede in its entirety the prior Employment Agreement dated April 13, 2004; and

WHEREAS, Employee and the Company desire to specify all benefits payable to Employee in connection with the employment.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Company and the Employee, each intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. Employment. This agreement shall supercede and replace all prior agreements between the Company and the Employee. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to employ the Employee as a Chief Executive Officer, and the Employee accepts this employment.

2. Duties. The Employee will make the best use of his energy, knowledge, and training in advancing the Company's interests on a full-time basis. He will diligently and conscientiously perform the duties of his position as well as such other duties as are directed by the Company's management. The Employee will make every effort to avoid using any trade secrets or confidential information that he may have in his possession from any previous employer in connection with his employment by the Company.

3. Term. The employment relationship created by this agreement shall continue on an "at will" basis. Except as specifically provided in Sections 10 and 11 of this Agreement, either party may terminate the employment relationship created by this Agreement for any reason or no reason by giving 10 working days prior written notice to the other party. Because the employment relationship is "at will," the Employee shall have no right to continued employment, and the Company may terminate the Employee (other than because of Employee's race, sex, age or other legally protected category) at any time. No document or statement (oral or written) by the Company or its officers or Board of Directors will create a right to continued employment.

(b) Except as required in his duties to the Company, the Employee will not, during his employment or for a period of three (3) years after termination of his employment with the Company, use or disclose Confidential Information to any person not authorized by the Company to receive it, excluding Confidential Information:

(iii)

employ or attempt to employ any of the Company's employees on behalf of any other entity competing with the Company, provided that, nothing in this Section 7 shall restrict the employee's employment by or association with any entity, venture, or enterprise which engages in a business with a product or service competitive with any product or service of the Company so long as the following conditions are complied with: (a) the Employee's employment or association with such entity, venture or enterprise is limited to work which does not involve or relate to the design, development, production, marketing or servicing of a product or service which is directly competitive with any product or service of the Company and (b) the Employee's employer takes reasonable measures to insure that the Employee is not involved with or consulted in any aspect of the design, development, production, marketing, or servicing of such competitive product or service.  
  
(b) Employee will, prior to accepting employment with any new employer, inform that employer of this Agreement and provide that employer with a copy of Section 7 of this Agreement, provided that he reasonably believed his new position is or may be contrary to this Agreement.

8. Conflicting Business. The Employee agrees that he will not transact business with the Company personally, or as agent, owner, partner, or shareholder of any other entity without the prior approval of the Board of Directors. The Employee further agrees that he will not engage in any business activity or outside employment that is likely to conflict with the Company's proprietary or business interests during the term of this Agreement.

9. No Adequate Remedy. The Employee understands that if he fails to fulfill his obligations under Sections 5, 6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement, the damages to the Company would be very difficult to determine. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company at law, in equity or by statute, the Employee hereby consents to the specific enforcement of Sections 5, 6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement by the Company through an injunction or restraining order issued by any appropriate court.

10. Termination Without Cause. Except as set forth in Section 11 herein, if, at any time, the Company terminates Employee’s employment with the Company other than for Cause, as that term is defined in Section 11(b)(iii) herein, Employee will be entitled to severance pay of twelve (12) times Employee’s then-current monthly base salary. Receipt of such severance shall not entitle Employee to any further benefits or compensation. The receipt of any severance pursuant to this Section will be subject to Employee signing and not timely revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company. This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A (“Section 409A”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), insofar as it relates to amounts subject to Section 409A, and this Agreement will be construed and administered accordingly. To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to Employer and Employee of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A.
