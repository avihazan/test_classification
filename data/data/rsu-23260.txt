1. PURPOSE OF PROGRAM. The Company’s Long-Term Incentive Program under the Plan shall be effective for all Awards incorporating these Terms on or after July 1, 2005, to advance the Company’s growth and prosperity by providing long-term financial incentives to its executives, and to further the Company’s philosophy of equity ownership by the Company’s officers in accordance with the Company’s Equity Ownership Guidelines.

3. OPTIONS. Initially, each “Option” is the right to purchase one Option Share at the Option Price, from its Vesting Date until its Expiration Date or forfeiture (subject to adjustments per the Plan). Options must be exercised with 48 hours advance written notice, unless waived by the Company. 

3.1 Option Price. “Option Price” means the closing price per Option Share on the Grant Date. The Option Price is payable to the Company in cash or any other method of payment authorized by the Committee in its discretion, which may include Stock (valued as the closing price per Share on the exercise date) or vested Options (valued as the closing price per Share on the exercise date, less the Option Price), in each case in accordance with applicable Rules. Similarly, the Participant must arrange for tax withholding in accordance with applicable Rules, to the satisfaction of the Committee.   
  
  


3.2 Option Shares. Initially, each “Option Share” is one Share of the Common Stock (subject to adjustments per the Plan).
