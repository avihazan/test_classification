18\. Waiver of Entitlement to Compensation or Damages. In consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock under this Agreement, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Restricted Stock or diminution in value of the Restricted Stock or shares of Stock acquired upon vesting of the Restricted Stock resulting from termination of the Participant’s service to the Company (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Participant irrevocably releases the Company from any such claim that may arise.

These laws may be the same or different from any Company insider trading policy. The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant’s responsibility to comply with such regulations, and that the Participant is advised to speak with the Participant’s personal advisor on this matter.

  


21\. No Advice Regarding Grant. No Employee of the Company is permitted to advise the Participant regarding participation in the Plan or the Participant’s acquisition or sale of the shares of Stock.
