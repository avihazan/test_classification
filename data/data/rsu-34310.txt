CU BANCORP 

2007 EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN 

AS RESTATED JULY 31, 2014 

This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of [ ], 2015 (the “Grant Date”) by and between CU Bancorp, a California corporation (the “Company”) and (the “Grantee”). 

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the 2007 Equity and Incentive (the “Plan”) pursuant to which awards of Restricted Stock Units may be granted; and 

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to grant the award of Restricted Stock Units provided for herein. 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Restricted Stock Units. 

1.1 Pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan, the Company hereby issues to the Grantee on the Grant Date an Award consisting of, in the aggregate, ( ) Restricted Stock Units (the “Restricted Stock Units”). Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. 

1.2 The Restricted Stock Units shall be credited to a separate account maintained for the Grantee on the books and records of the Company (the “Account”). All amounts credited to the Account shall continue for all purposes to be part of the general assets of the Company. 

2\. Consideration. The grant of the Restricted Stock Units is made in consideration of the services to be rendered by the Grantee to the Company. 

3\. Vesting. 

3.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, provided that the Grantee remains in Continuous Service through the applicable vesting date, the Restricted Stock Units will vest in accordance with the following schedule (the period during which restrictions apply, the “Restricted Period”): 

1 

* * *  
  
Vesting Date: Number of Restricted Stock Units That Vest:  
[ ], 2017  
[ ], 2018  
[ ], 2019  
  
Once vested, the Restricted Stock Units become “Vested Units.” 

3.2 The foregoing vesting schedule notwithstanding, if the Grantee’s Continuous Service terminates for any reason at any time before all of his or her Restricted Stock Units have vested, the Grantee’s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically forfeited upon such termination of Continuous Service and neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall have any further obligations to the Grantee under this Agreement. 

4\. Restrictions. Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan, during the Restricted Period and until such time as the Restricted Stock Units are settled in accordance with Section 6, the Restricted Stock Units or the rights relating thereto may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Restricted Stock Units or the rights relating thereto shall be wholly ineffective and, if any such attempt is made, the Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited by the Grantee and all of the Grantee’s rights to such units shall immediately terminate without any payment or consideration by the Company. 

5\. Rights as Shareholder; Dividend Equivalents. 

5.1 The Grantee shall not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest and are settled by the issuance of such shares of Common Stock. 

5.2 Upon and following the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee shall be the record owner of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares are sold or otherwise disposed of, and as record owner shall be entitled to all rights of a shareholder of the Company (including voting rights). 

5.3 If, prior to the settlement date, the Company declares a cash or stock dividend on the shares of Common Stock, then, on the payment date of the dividend, the Grantee’s Account shall be credited with Dividend Equivalents in an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid to the Grantee if one share of Common Stock had been issued on the Grant Date for each Restricted Stock Unit granted to the Grantee as set forth in this Agreement.

* * *

5.4 The Dividend Equivalents credited to the Grantee’s Account will be deemed to be reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units (rounded to the nearest whole share) and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they are attributable and shall vest or be forfeited (if applicable) at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units to which they are attributable. Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall also be credited with additional Restricted Stock Units as any further dividends are declared. 

6\. Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. 

6.1 Subject to Section 9 hereof, promptly following the vesting date, and in any event no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such vesting occurs, the Company shall (a) issue and deliver to the Grantee the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Vested Units and cash equal to any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect to such Vested Units or, at the discretion of the Committee, shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such Dividend Equivalents; and (b) enter the Grantee’s name on the books of the Company as the shareholder of record with respect to the shares of Common Stock delivered to the Grantee. 

6.2 Notwithstanding Section 6.1, to the extent the Company reasonable anticipates that the Company’s corporate income tax deduction for the payment of shares under this Agreement as a result of the application of Code Section 162(m), will be limited or eliminated, the Company shall defer the payment and delivery of such shares to Participant to the earliest date where the Company reasonably anticipates that such deduction will not be limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m). 

6.3 Notwithstanding Section 6.1, if the Grantee is deemed a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Committee, at a time when the Grantee becomes eligible for settlement of the RSUs upon his “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent necessary to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such settlement will be delayed until the earlier of: (a) the date that is six months following the Grantee’s separation from service and (b) the Grantee’s death. 

7\. No Right to Continued Service. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall confer upon the Grantee any right to be retained in any position, as an Employee, Consultant or Director of the Company. Further, nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Company to terminate the Grantee’s Continuous Service at any time, with or without Cause.

8\. Adjustments. If any change is made to the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company, if required, the Restricted Stock Units shall be adjusted or terminated in any manner as contemplated by Section 4.3 of the Plan. 

9\. Tax Liability and Withholding. 

9.1 The Grantee shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from any compensation paid to the Grantee pursuant to the Plan, the amount of any required withholding taxes in respect of the Restricted Stock Units and to take all such other action as the Committee deems necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes. The Committee may permit the Grantee to satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation by any of the following means, or by a combination of such means: 

(a) tendering a cash payment. 

(b) authorizing the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to the Grantee as a result of the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock shall be withheld with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law. 

(c) delivering to the Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock. 

9.2 Notwithstanding any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee’s responsibility and the Company (a) makes no representation or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any shares; and (b) does not commit to structure the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax-Related Items. 

10\. Compliance with Law. The issuance and transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Grantee with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange on which the Company’s shares of Common Stock may be listed. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued or transferred unless and until any then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel. 

11\. Notices. Any notice required to be delivered to the Company under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to [ ], at the Company’s principal corporate offices.
