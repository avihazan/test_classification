A Director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation.

The designation of such committee and the delegation thereto of authority shall not operate to relieve the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, of any responsibility imposed upon it or him by law. If there be more than two (2) members on such committee, a majority of any such committee may determine its action and may fix the time and place of its meetings, unless provided otherwise by the Board.

Except as otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, each committee may adopt such rules and regulations governing its proceedings, quorum, and manner of acting as it shall deem proper and desirable.

  


Each such committee shall keep a written record of its acts and proceedings and shall submit such record to the Board of Directors. Failure to submit such record, or failure of the Board to approve any action indicated therein will not, however, invalidate such action to the extent it has been carried out by the Corporation prior to the time the record of such action was, or should have been, submitted to the Board of Directors as herein provided.
