During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually; provided, however, that a salary increase shall not necessarily be awarded as a result of any such review. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company to Executive hereunder. The Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced and may not be reduced after any increase. 

(b) In consideration of Executive’s execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Executive a bonus in the amount of $220,000 in cash. Fifty percent (50%) of such bonus shall be payable by the Company in one lump sum promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Executive and the remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be paid on December 31, 2005.

(c) In the event that the Incentive Plan is not approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s 2005 annual meeting or any adjournment thereof, then the Company shall not be obligated hereunder to issue any of the Restricted Shares to Executive and, in lieu thereof, the Company shall pay to Executive an additional cash bonus of $880,000 (“Additional Cash Bonus”), which shall vest and be payable in four equal installments, the first of which shall be payable within five business days after the Company’s 2005 annual meeting and thereafter on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of this Agreement.

Any such annual incentive bonus shall not exceed 100% of the Annual Base Salary in effect at the end of the fiscal year with respect to which such bonus is paid and shall be based upon pre-established goals as determined by the Compensation Committee and set out in writing. Each such annual incentive bonus shall be paid on April 15 of the year following the year with respect to which such bonus is paid. 

(e) During the Employment Period, Executive shall participate in any long-term incentive plan that may be maintained or adopted by the Company, as approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee.

(g) Executive’s Understanding of this Section. Executive hereby represents to the Company that he has read and understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this Section 6. Executive acknowledges that the geographic scope and duration of the covenants contained in paragraph (c) of this Section 6 are the result of arm’s-length bargaining and are fair and reasonable in light of (i) the importance of the functions performed by Executive and the length of time it would take the Company to find and train a suitable replacement, (ii) the nature and wide geographic scope of the operations of the Company, (iii) Executive’s level of control over and contact with the Company’s business and operations in all jurisdictions where same are conducted and (iv) the fact that the Company’s Business is conducted throughout the geographic area where competition is restricted by this Agreement.
