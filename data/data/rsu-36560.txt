This Stock Option Award Agreement (this “Agreement”), dated as of September 4, 2012 evidencing the Option (as defined below), is made by and between VTB Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Juergen Stark (the “Optionee”). 

WITNESSETH: 

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the VTB Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which options may be granted to the Optionee to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock; and 

WHEREAS, the committee of the Board of Directors of the Company responsible for administering the Plan (the “Committee”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant to the Optionee a Stock Option to purchase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock set forth herein. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, and in reliance on the representations and warranties contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Option. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee an option (the “Option”) to purchase 6,730,448 shares of Common Stock (such shares of Common Stock, the “Common Shares”) with a grant date (the “Grant Date”) of September 4, 2012 on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and as otherwise provided in the Plan (this “Award”). The Option is not intended to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 

2\. The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein (including without limitation, the preceding sentence), the Award and this Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the Plan. The Committee shall have final authority to interpret and construe the Plan and this Agreement and to make any and all determinations under them, consistent with their terms, and its decision shall be binding and conclusive upon the Optionee and his or her legal representative in respect of any questions arising under the Plan or this Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan (except where the Plan is expressly superseded by this Agreement), the terms of the Plan shall govern and control. 

3\. Purchase Price. The Option price of the Common Shares covered by the Option shall be $2.01 per share. 

4\. Vesting. The Option shall be eligible to vest based on the Optionee’s continued employment with the Company. Provided the Optionee does not incur a Termination of Service prior to the applicable vesting date, the Option shall vest with respect to 25% of the Common Shares subject thereto on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and ratably each month thereafter (i.e., 2.0833% per month) as of the first day of each month until the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date; provided, that, immediately prior to the consummation of an Approved Sale, 50% of the then-unvested portion of the Option shall vest; provided, further, that the other 50% of the then-unvested portion of the Option (the “Unvested CIC Options”) shall also vest immediately prior to the consummation of an Approved Sale unless the successor company or its direct or indirect parent agrees to assume the Unvested CIC Options or replace them with options that maintain the existing aggregate option spread of the Unvested CIC Options, provide for vesting that is not less favorable to Optionee than the Unvested CIC Options and are otherwise substantially similar to the Unvested CIC Options in connection with the Approved Sale. 

5\. Option Term and Expiration. Once a portion of the Option becomes vested, subject to the terms of the Plan, it will remain exercisable until it is exercised or until it expires. The Option shall expire at the end of the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending at 11:59 p.m. on the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the “Expiration Date”). The Option shall not be exercisable after the Expiration Date.

12\. Withholding of Taxes. The Common Shares awarded upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to applicable federal, state, and local tax withholding requirement. 

13\. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 

14\. No Rights to Continue Service. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Optionee any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee, consultant or director of the Company or its affiliates nor shall it interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company or its affiliates, which right is hereby expressly reserved, to remove, terminate or discharge the Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever.

INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT   
  
Optionee:  
Common Shares: Common Shares of VTB Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”)  
Amount Paid:  
Date:  
  
In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Common Shares, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Company the following: 

Optionee is aware of the Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Common Shares. Optionee is acquiring these Common Shares for investment for Optionee’s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). 

Optionee understands that the Common Shares must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Optionee further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Common Shares. Optionee understands that no certificate evidencing the Common Shares will be issued and that Common Shares are nontransferable except as provided in the Stockholders Agreement. 

Optionee is familiar with the provisions of Rule 701 and Rule 144, each promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance, permit limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly from the issuer thereof, in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Rule 701 provides that if the issuer qualifies under Rule 701 at the time of the grant of the Option to Optionee, the exercise will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. In the event the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ninety (90) days thereafter (or such longer period as any market stand-off agreement may require) the Common Shares exempt under Rule 701 may be resold, subject to the satisfaction of certain of the conditions specified by Rule 144, including: (a) the resale being made through a broker in an unsolicited “broker’s transaction” or in transactions directly with a market maker (as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and, in the case of an affiliate, (b) the availability of certain public information about the Company; (c) the amount of Common Snares being sold during any three month period not exceeding the limitations specified in Rule 144(e); and (d) the timely filing of a Form 144, if applicable. 

12 

In the event that the Company does not qualify under Rule 701 at the time of grant of the Option, then the Common Shares may be resold in certain limited circumstances subject to the provisions of Rule 144, which requires the resale to occur not less than one year after the later of the date the Common Shares were sold by the Company or the date the Common Shares were sold by an affiliate of the Company, within the meaning of Rule 144; and, in the case of acquisition of the Common Shares by an affiliate, or by a non-affiliate who subsequently holds the Common Shares less than two years, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in sections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the paragraph immediately above. 

Optionee further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 701 or 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rules 144 and 701 are not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rules 144 or 701 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that any such other registration exemption will be available in such event.
