Recitals:

  


A.

CTI has advanced, or agreed to advance, $150,000.00 to Consolidated contemporaneously with this Agreement.  
  
  


B.

As a partial condition to such advance, Consolidated has agreed to grant CTI the option to purchase Consolidated common shares set forth herein.  
  
  


Now, Therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby expressed, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


1. Option. During the Exercise Period (as hereafter defined), CTI shall have the option, with five (5) days written notice to Consolidated, in one or more transactions, to purchase common shares of Consolidated in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Ownership Cap. The Ownership Cap shall mean ninety percent (90%) of the fully diluted outstanding common shares of Consolidated, immediately after giving effect to the final purchase of common shares by CTI which equals the Ownership Cap.

  


2. Option Price. The price per common share purchased pursuant to this Agreement shall, prior to any purchase made hereunder, be equal to the quotient of (a) $2,222,222 divided by (b) the product of (i) common shares of Consolidated outstanding, multiplied by (ii) 11.111.

  


3. Exercise Period. The Exercise Period shall begin on the date that Consolidated obtains shareholder consent to increase its number of authorized shares outstanding to an amount sufficient to issue to CTI the common shares up to the Ownership Cap, and shall terminate sixty (60) days after such date. Consolidated agrees to promptly take all steps necessary, and use its best efforts to increase its authorized shares in order to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

  


4. Employment Contracts. If CTI exercises its option to acquire common shares pursuant to this Agreement, and thereby acquires sufficient control of Consolidated to influence management, Consolidated shall enter into two (2) year management contracts with the following Consolidated officers at compensation levels as hereafter specified, although managerial duties and responsibilities may be reassigned: Carl Yeatman; Carl Glenn; Douglas Newman. The aggregate compensation for all such contracts is $900,000.00, payable $300,000.00 upon execution of the contracts, with the remainder payable on a mutually agreeable schedule over the remaining 24 months. In addition, upon acquisition of control of Consolidated, CTI will make available to Consolidated CTI’s intellectual property regarding crude oil upgrading in order for Consolidated to make use of such technology.
