When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which the stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, except as provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and at the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.

At all meetings of the stockholders, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. If, however, a majority shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power, by a majority in voting power thereof, to adjourn the meeting from time to time until the requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented.

All other elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating to such meeting, action by consent or other action.

Section 1.09. Consent in Lieu of Meeting. As provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any corporate action, with respect to which the vote of the stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted by any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, may be taken without that vote and meeting, and that vote and meeting may be dispensed with, if that corporate action has been consented to in writing by the holders of a majority (or, if with respect to a particular corporate action the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws specifies a greater percentage, by the holders of that percentage) of the stock that would have been entitled to vote upon that action if a meeting were held. Prompt notice shall be given to all stockholders of the taking of any corporate action pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph unless that action has been consented to in writing by the holders of all of the stock that would have been entitled to vote upon that action if a meeting were held.
