(g) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, notify the Investor of the happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge, as a result of which the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ("Registration Default"), and promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement or other appropriate filing with the SEC to correct such untrue statement or omission, and take any other commercially reasonable steps to cure the Registration Default, and, unless available to the Investor without charge through EDGAR, the SEC's website or the Company's website, deliver a number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the Investor as the Investor may reasonably request.

(h) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED];

  


(i) Use its commercially reasonable efforts, if eligible, either to (i) cause all the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on a national securities exchange and on each additional national securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (ii) secure designation of all the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement as a National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System ("Nasdaq”) security within the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 of the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the quotation of the Registrable Securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market; or if, despite the Company’s commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the preceding clause (i) or (ii), the Company is unsuccessful in doing so, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure authorization of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and quotation for such Registrable Securities on the OTCQB or OTCQX electronic quotation and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing;

  


(j) Provide a transfer agent for the Registrable Securities not later than the Subscription Date under the Purchase Agreement;

4. Obligations of the Investor. In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities, the Investor shall have the following obligations;

4

* * *

  


(a) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of the Investor that the Investor shall timely furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it, as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall timely execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request.

  


(b) The Investor by such Investor’s acceptance of the Registrable Securities agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement hereunder; and

  


(c) The Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(d)(ii) or (iii) or 3(g) above, the Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until the Investor receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(d)(ii) or (iii) or 3(g) and, if so directed by the Company, the Investor shall deliver to the Company (at the expense of the Company) or destroy (and deliver to the Company a certificate of destruction) all copies in the Investor’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

  


5. Expenses of Registration. All reasonable expenses incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Section 3, including, without limitation, all registration, listing, and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company shall be borne by the Company.

  


  


6. Indemnification. After Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:

  


(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless, the Investor, the directors, if any, of such Investor, the officers, if any, of such Investor, each person, if any, who controls the Investor within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an "Indemnified Person"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (joint or several) incurred (collectively, "Claims") to which any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereof or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being collectively referred to as "Violations"). Subject to Section 6(b) hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Investor, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a) shall not (i) apply to any Claims arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof; (ii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, inure to the benefit of any such person from whom the person asserting any such Claim purchased the Registrable Securities that are the subject thereof (or to the benefit of any person controlling such person) if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof; (iii) be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Investor to deliver or cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by the Company; or (iv) apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Investor will indemnify the Company, its officers, directors and agents (including legal counsel) against any claims arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by or on behalf of the Investor, expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, subject to such limitations and conditions set forth in the previous sentence.

(b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such Indemnified Person shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. In such event, the Company shall pay for only one separate legal counsel for the Investor selected by the Investor. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred and is due and payable.

5

* * *

  


7. Contribution. To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that (a) no contribution shall be made under circumstances where the maker would not have been liable for indemnification under the fault standards set forth in Section 6; (b) no seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and (c) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.

  


8. Reports under Exchange Act. With a view to making available to the Investor the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investor to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration ("Rule 144"), the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

  


(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

  


(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act for so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements, and the filing of such reports is required for sales under Rule 144;

  


(c) furnish to the Investor so long as the Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) unless available to the Investor without charge through EDGAR, the SEC's website or the Company's website, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration; and

6

* * *

  


(d) at the request of any Investor of Registrable Securities, give its Transfer Agent instructions (supported by an opinion of Company counsel, if required or requested by the Transfer Agent) to the effect that, upon the Transfer Agent’s receipt from such Investor of:

  


(i) a certificate (a “Rule 144 Certificate”) certifying (A) that such Investor has held the shares of Registrable Securities which the Investor proposes to sell (the “Securities Being Sold”) for a period of not less than (1) year and (B) as to such other matters as may be appropriate in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and

  


(ii) an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company (for which purposes it is agreed that the initial Investor’s counsel shall be deemed acceptable if such opinion is not given by Company counsel) that, based on the Rule 144 Certificate, Securities Being Sold may be sold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, even in the absence of an effective Registration Statement,

  


the Transfer Agent is to effect the transfer of the Securities Being Sold and issue to the buyer(s) or transferee(s) thereof one or more stock certificates representing the transferred Securities Being Sold without any restrictive legend and without recording any restrictions on the transferability of such shares on the Transfer Agent’s books and records (except to the extent any such legend or restriction results from facts other than the identity of the Investor, as the seller or transferor thereof, or the status, including any relevant legends or restrictions, of the shares of the Securities Being Sold while held by the Investor). If the Transfer Agent requires any additional documentation at the time of the transfer, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered all such reasonable additional documentation as may be necessary to effectuate the issuance of an unlegended certificate.

  


9\. Miscellaneous.

  


(a) Registered Owners. A person or entity is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such person or entity owns of record such Registrable Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more persons or entities with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from the registered owner of such Registrable Securities.
