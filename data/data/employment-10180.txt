# 1. Services to be Rendered by Employee. The Company hereby employs, engages and hires Employee in the capacity of Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, and Employee hereby accepts and agrees to such hiring, engagement and employment. Employee agrees to perform any and all duties and to assume any and all responsibilities that may be assigned from time to time by the Company or its authorized agents.

Employee shall also exercise due diligence and care in the performance of all duties performed for the Company under this Agreement.

# 

# 2. Term; Termination.

# 

## A. Term. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will employ Employee, and Employee will serve the Company, for two years from the effective date of this Agreement (the “Initial Term”). Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive periods of one year each (each, a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”), unless the Company provides written notice to Employee of its intention not to renew the Agreement at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term in accordance with Section 2(B)(ii) below.

No act or failure to act by the Employee shall be deemed “willful” if done, or omitted to be done, by him in good faith and with the reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

## C. Termination by Employee. Employee may terminate his employment by the Company at any time by giving 90 days prior written notice thereof to the Company.

## iii. No Termination Payment. Employee shall not be entitled to the Termination Payment in the event that the Company terminates Employee’s employment in connection with the expiration of the then-current term of this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(B)(ii) above or for Cause pursuant to Section 2(B)(iii) above, or if the Employee terminates the employment pursuant to Section 2(C) above, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(B) below.

iv. Effect of Termination on Vesting of Stock Options. In the event that Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 2(B)(i) above, all unvested options owned by Employee to purchase common stock of XELR8 Holdings, Inc. shall vest as of the effective date of such termination.

During such ninety (90) day period, the Company may terminate Employee at any time. If this Agreement terminates pursuant to this Section 3(b)(ii), such termination shall be deemed a termination pursuant to Section 2(B)(i) for purposes of entitling Employee to receive the Termination Payment provided for in Section 2(D)(i).

## 

Information will damage the Company’s business; that Confidential Information would be susceptible to immediate competitive application by a competitor of the Company; that the Company’s business is substantially dependent on access to and the continuing secrecy of Confidential Information; that Confidential Information is unique to the Company and known only to Employee, the Company and certain key employees and contractors of the Company; that the Company shall at all times retain ownership and control of all Confidential Information; and that the restrictions contained in this paragraph are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company’s business.

## D. Records Containing Confidential Information. All documents or other records containing or reflecting Confidential Information (“Confidential Documents”) prepared by or provided to Employee are and shall remain the Company’s property. Except with the Company’s prior written consent, Employee shall not copy or use any Confidential Document for any purpose not relating directly to Employee’s work on the Company’s behalf, or use, disclose or sell any Confidential Document to any party. Upon the termination of Employee’s employment or upon the Company’s request, Employee shall immediately deliver to the Company or its designee (and shall not keep in Employee’s possession or deliver to anyone else) all Confidential Documents and all other property belonging to the Company. This paragraph shall not bar Employee from complying with any subpoena or court order, provided that Employee shall at the earliest practicable date provide a copy of the subpoena or court order to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

## 

## E. Employee’s Former Employers’ Confidential Information. Employee shall not, during Employee’s employment with the Company, improperly use or disclose to the Company any proprietary information or trade secrets belonging to any former employer or any third party as to whom Employee owes a duty of nondisclosure.

##

6\. Inventions.

# 

## A. Disclosure. Upon the Company’s request, Employee shall promptly disclose to the Company, in a manner specified by the Company in its sole discretion, all ideas (including new products), processes, trademarks and service marks, inventions, discoveries and improvements to any of the foregoing, that Employee learns of, conceives, develops or creates alone or with others during the term of Employee’s employment (whether or not conceived, developed or created during working hours) that directly or indirectly arises from or relates to: (i) the Company’s business; (ii) work performed for the Company by Employee or any other Company employee; (iii) the use of the Company’s property or time; or (iv) access to the Company’s Confidential Information and/or Confidential Documents.

## 

## B. Assignment. Employee assigns to the Company, without further consideration, Employee’s entire right to any concept, idea or invention described in the preceding paragraph, which shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company whether or not subject to patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret protection under applicable law. Employee also acknowledges that all original works of authorship that are made by Employee (solely or jointly with others), within the scope of Employee’s employment, and that are protectable by copyright, are “works made for hire,” as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 101). To the extent that any such works, by operation of law, cannot be “works made for hire,” Employee assigns to the Company all right, title and interest in and to such works and to any related copyrights.

## 

## C. Additional Instruments. Employee shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all additional instruments or documents deemed at any time by the Company in its sole discretion to be necessary to carry out the intentions of this paragraph.

## 

# 7. Survival. Employee’s obligations under this Agreement shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment and shall thereafter be enforceable whether or not such termination is later claimed or found to be wrongful or to constitute or result in a breach of any contract or of any other duty owed or claimed to be owed by the Company to Employee.

# 

# 8. Remedies. Employee acknowledges that upon a breach of any obligation under this Agreement, the Company will suffer immediate and irreparable harm and damage for which money alone cannot fully compensate the Company. Employee therefore agrees that upon such breach or threat of imminent breach of any obligation under this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to, and Employee shall not oppose entry of, a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other injunctive relief, without posting any bond or other security, barring Employee from violating any such provision. This paragraph shall not be construed as an election of any remedy, or as a waiver of any right available to the Company under this Agreement or the law, including the right to seek damages from Employee for a breach of any provision of this Agreement, nor shall this paragraph be construed to limit the rights or remedies available under Colorado law for any violation of any provision of this Agreement.
