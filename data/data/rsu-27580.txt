6\. Voting Rights. The Participant will not have the right to vote with respect to the Units prior to payment of Common Stock in satisfaction of the Earned Units.

7\. Change in Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, any remaining conditions on forfeiture with respect to the Units shall immediately lapse and the Performance Goals will be deemed satisfied at the target level of performance pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan.

8\. Tax Withholding. Participant authorizes the Company to deduct, to the extent required by statute or regulation, from payments of any kind due to Participant or anyone claiming through Participant, the aggregate amount of any federal, state, local or other taxes required to be withheld in respect of any present or future Award under the Plan.
