As soon as practicable after its receipt of such notice, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax to the Optionee (or other person enti tled to exercise this Option), deliver the shares to the Optionee (or other person entitled to exercise this Option), either electronically or by means of a stock certificate; provided, however, that the time of such delivery may be postponed by the

Payment of the option price may be made in cash or cash equivalents or in whole or in part in shares of Stock, by means of a “cashless exercise” procedure with a broker, or by means of a “net exercise” arrangement, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 5(d) of the Plan; provided, however, that the Board reserves the right upon receipt of any written notice of exercise from the Optionee to require payment in cash with respect to the shares contemplated in such notice. If the Optionee (or other person entitled to exercise this Option) fails to pay for and accept delivery of all of the shares specified in such notice upon tender of delivery thereof, his/her right to exercise this Option with respect to such shares not paid for may be terminated by the Company.

5. Withholding Taxes. The Optionee hereby agrees, as a condition to any exercise of this Option, to provide to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy its minimum obligation to withhold certain federal, state and local taxes arising by reason of such exercise (the “Withholding Amount”), by (a) authorizing the Company to withhold the Withholding Amount from her/his cash compensation, (b) remitting the Withholding Amount to the Company in cash, or (c) paying the Withholding Amount in whole o r in part in the form of shares of Stock by authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares to be issued in accordance with Section 15(b) of the Plan; provided that to the extent that the Withholding Amount is not provided by one or a combination of such methods, the Company may at its election withhold from the Stock delivered upon exercise of this Option that number of shares of Stock having a fair market value, on the date of exercise, sufficient to eliminate any deficiency in the Withholding Amount.

6. Non-assignability of Option. This Option shall not be assignable or transferable by the Optionee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the life of the Optionee, this Option shall be exercisable only by him/her.

7. Compliance with Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to sell or issue any shares of Stock or other securities pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless the shares of stock or other securities with respect to which this Option is being exercised are at that time effectively registered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws. In the event shares or other securities shall be issued which shall not be so registered, the Opti onee hereby represents, warrants and agrees that he/she will receive such shares or other securities for investment and not with a view to their resale or distribution, and will execute an appropriate investment letter satisfactory to the Company and its counsel.

8. Rights as Stockholder. The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by this Option until the date of issuance of such shares to him/her either electronically or by means of a stock certificate. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued.

10. Termination or Amendment of Plan. The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time. No such termination or amendment will affect rights and obligations under this Option, to the extent it is then in effect and unexercised.
