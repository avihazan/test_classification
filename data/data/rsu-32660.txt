Exhibit 10.65 

Old Dominion Electric Cooperative 



THIS AGREEMENT is between Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (the “Cooperative”) and KONSTANTINOS N. KAPPATOS (the “Optionee”), and is dated as of March 1, 2002 (the “Date of Grant”). 

The Cooperative hereby grants the Optionee an option to purchase shares of mutual funds selected by the Board, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

The grant of this Option is made pursuant to the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative 2002 Option Plan (the “Plan”), a copy of which has been provided to the Optionee, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. The terms of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In the case of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. Any term used in this Agreement that is defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning given to that term in the Plan. 

1. Grant of Option. 

(a) The Cooperative grants the Optionee a nonstatutory stock option (the “Option”) to purchase from the Cooperative option shares (the “Shares”) listed in Appendix A to this Agreement. The price paid by the Optionee to exercise the Option shall be equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total vested Option Value (as defined in the Plan) as of the applicable vesting date listed in Section 2(a). The total Option Value assigned to this Option is $408,000. The Optionee will become vested in the Option Value pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement. 

(b) The grant of this Option shall not obligate the Cooperative to pay the Optionee any particular amount of remuneration, to continue the employment of the Optionee after the grant or to make further grants to the Optionee at any time thereafter. 

2. Entitlement to Exercise Option.

(a) The Optionee must be an employee of the Cooperative on the applicable vesting date listed below in order to become vested in his Option Value. The Optionee will become vested in the Option Value as follows:

This vesting schedule shall accelerate and the Option shall become fully exercisable upon the first to occur of (i) a “Change in Control,” (ii) the Optionee’s “Disability,” or (iii) the 

* * *

Optionee’s death. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “Change in Control” and “Disability” shall have the same meaning, and shall be interpreted in the same manner, as the definition of those terms used in the Executive Severance Agreement between the Optionee and the Cooperative, dated as of January 1, 2000. 

(b) Except as otherwise stated in this paragraph, the Option may be exercised on or after the date the Optionee both (x) has attained retirement age pursuant to the Cooperative’s retirement age policy in effect as of the date the Optionee terminates employment, and (y) has terminated employment with the Cooperative. 

(i) If the Optionee retires or ceases to be employed by the Cooperative for any reason, including a termination because of his death or Disability and at a time when all or a portion of this Option was vested pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Optionee (or his beneficiary or personal representative) may exercise any or all of his vested Option within fifteen (15) years after the Date of Grant. 

(ii) If the Optionee is terminated by the Cooperative for Cause (as defined in the Plan), this Option will expire immediately (with respect to both the vested and unvested Option Value) as of the date of the misconduct. 

(c) In no event may this Option be exercised after the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. 

3. Method of Exercise and Payment.

(a) The Optionee may exercise his Option by delivering a written notice to the Record Keeper in the form attached as Exhibit A. Exercise of the Option may be made only within the 10 business days before the end of a calendar quarter. The exercise date will be (i) in the case of notice by mail, the date of postmark; or (ii) if delivered in person, the date of delivery. The notice must be signed and state the number of shares the Optionee has elected to purchase. The Optionee may exercise the Option in whole or in part, but only with respect to whole shares of stock. 

(b The exercise notice must be accompanied by payment of the Option Price in full by cash (which shall include payment by check, bank draft or money order payable to the Cooperative). Instead of paying cash, the Optionee may agree to surrender Shares being acquired for all or part of the cash payment (for this purpose, Shares will be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise). 

4. Tax Obligations Upon Exercise. The difference between the Fair Market Value of the shares purchased when this Option is exercised and the Option price is compensation taxable to the Optionee as ordinary income and is subject to applicable federal and state taxes. By signing the Agreement, the Optionee agrees to make arrangements satisfactory to the Cooperative to comply with applicable tax withholding requirements, if any.

5. Nontransferability. In general, this Option shall not be transferable by the Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and subject to federal and state securities laws, the Optionee may transfer this all or a portion of this Option to one or more immediate family members, to a trust for the benefit of immediate family members, or to a partnership, limited liability company, or other entity the only partners, members, or interest-holders of which are among the Optionee’s immediate family members. Consideration may not be paid for the transfer of this Option. 

6. Adjustments. If the number of outstanding shares of mutual fund Shares is increased or decreased as a result of a subdivision or consolidation of shares, the payment of a stock dividend, stock split, or any other change in capitalization, the number of unexercised Option Shares and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted by the Cooperative, whose determination shall be binding. 

7. Employment Rights. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement confers upon the Optionee any right to continue as an employee of the Cooperative or limits in any respect the right of the Cooperative to terminate the Optionee’s employment. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

(a) The Optionee agrees that the Cooperative and its Members’ officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, contractors, or representatives will not be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including but not limited to, damages or costs incurred as a result of loss of time, loss of savings, loss of data, loss of profits, or loss of goodwill, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, that may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement, and whether such liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, products liability or otherwise. 

(b) In no event will the collective liability of the Record Keeper and its affiliates for any damages incurred by the Optionee ever exceed the fees received by the Record Keeper under this Agreement during the twelve months prior to the time at which the damages arose regardless of the form of action, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, products liability or otherwise. 

9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 

10. Acceptance of Option. This Agreement deals only with the Option the Optionee has been granted and not its exercise. The Optionee’s acceptance of the Option places no obligation or commitment on the Optionee to exercise the Option. By signing below, the Optionee indicates acceptance of the Option and his or her agreement to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, which, together with the terms of the Plan, shall become the Cooperative’s Stock Option Agreement with the Optionee. The Optionee also acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan.

    Note: Keep in mind that returns on any fund may vary from month to month and may
    include both gains and losses to your account. While the potential return on
    investment is greater in the equity funds than in the bond and money market
    funds, the risk is also greater. However, equity funds typically produce larger
    total investment returns than bond and money market funds when the returns are
    compounded over a five- to ten-year period.
