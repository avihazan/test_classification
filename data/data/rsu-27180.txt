Exhibit 10.35

  


MASSIVE INTERACTIVE, INC.

2015 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

  




  


  


This RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of April __, 2015, by and between Massive Interactive, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and ___________________ (the “Grantee”). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions associated with the Company’s award to Grantee of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Massive Interactive, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for the number of Shares set forth below. The terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, and capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings ascribed to them under the Plan.

  


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and Grantee’s continued provision of valuable services as an employee of the Company, the parties, intending to be bound, agree as follows:

  


1\. Issuance of Stock. The Company hereby agrees to issue to Grantee _________________ (####) shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), which for purposes of this Agreement are valued at $0.15 per share, representing the price of the Company’s stock in the public markets as of market close on April 17, 2015 (the date of approval by the Company’s board of directors). All of the Shares received by the Grantee from the Company pursuant to this Agreement are subject to an option by the Company to repurchase such Shares.

  


2\. Repurchase Option.

  


(a) The termination of the Grantee’s Continuous Service with the Company either by Grantee for any reason or by the Company for Cause shall be a “Triggering Event.” In the event that a Triggering Event occurs, the Company shall, from the date of termination (as reasonably fixed and determined by the Company), have an option (the “Repurchase Option”) for a period of 90 days to repurchase any of the Shares that are not vested under the vesting schedule set forth on Exhibit A hereto (the “Unvested Shares”) for no additional consideration. In addition, if the Triggering Event is a termination of Grantee’s Continuous Service by the Company for Cause, then the Repurchase Option will also include an option to purchase any of the Shares that are vested under the vesting schedule set forth on Exhibit A for no additional consideration. In the event the Company elects to exercise the Repurchase Option, it shall be exercised by the Company by written notice to the Grantee, which notice shall specify the number of Shares and the time (not later than 30 days from the date of the Company’s notice) and place for the closing of the repurchase of the Shares. Upon delivery of such notice and payment of the purchase price in accordance with the terms herewith, the Company shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Shares being repurchased and all rights and interests therein or relating thereto, and the Company shall have the right to retain and transfer to its own name the number of Shares being repurchased by the Company.

* * *

  


(b) Whenever the Company shall have the right to repurchase Shares hereunder, the Company’s board of directors may designate and assign to one or more assignees the right to exercise all or part of the Company’s repurchase rights under this Agreement to purchase all or a part of such Shares.

  


3\. Release of Shares From Repurchase Option/Accelerated Vesting. In the event the Repurchase Option is triggered pursuant to a Triggering Event and the Company (or its assigns) fails to exercise the Company’s option for the repurchase of any or all of the Shares then, upon the expiration of the 90-day option period, any and all such Shares not repurchased by the Company shall be released from the Repurchase Option. In the event of any termination of Grantee’s Continuous Service with the Company that does not constitute a Triggering Event, then all Shares shall be immediately released from the Repurchase Option. Upon the release of the Repurchase Option, any Unvested Shares shall immediately vest.

  


4\. Restriction on Transfer; Ownership. Except for a transfer to a “Permitted Transferee” (as defined below), none of the Unvested Shares or any beneficial interest therein shall be transferred, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way. For purposes of this Agreement, “Permitted Transferee” shall mean a spouse, lineal ancestor or descendant, natural or adopted, and a spouse of a lineal ancestor or descendant, or a trust for the sole benefit of such persons or any of them.

  


All transferees of Shares or any interest therein (including Permitted Transferees) will receive and hold such Shares or interest subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and shall agree in writing to take such Shares or interest therein subject to all the terms of this Agreement, including restrictions on further transfer. Any sale or transfer of the Company’s Shares shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are met.

  


Grantee will not have any rights and/or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Shares, including voting or dividend rights, unless, until and as the Shares vest; provided, however, that Grantee will be entitled to receive dividends with respect to Unvested Shares prior to the vesting of such Shares as follows: (a) any regular cash dividends paid with respect to an Unvested Share will be retained by the Company and will be paid to Grantee, without interest, within thirty (30) days after the associated Share vests as provided in Sections 2 and 3 hereof, and will be forfeited if and when the associated Share is repurchased, and (b) any property (other than cash) distributed with respect to an Unvested Share (including without limitation a distribution of stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, or otherwise, or a distribution of other securities with respect to an associated Share) will be subject to the restrictions of this Agreement in the same manner and for so long as the associated Share remains subject to those restrictions, and will be forfeited if and when the associated Share is repurchased or will vest if and when the associated Share vests. If any Shares are repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Option, then, on the date of such repurchase, Grantee shall no longer have any rights as a stockholder with respect to such repurchased Shares or any interest therein.

  


5\. Investment Intent; Legends on Certificates.

  


2

* * *

  


(a) Simultaneously with the execution hereof, the Grantee has executed and delivered to the Company a copy of the Investment Representation Statement in the form of Exhibit B hereto concerning the Grantee’s investment intent with respect to the Shares.

  


(b) The Grantee acknowledges that the certificates evidencing the Shares shall be endorsed with a legend, in addition to any other legends required by this Agreement or any other agreement to which the Shares are subject, substantially as follows.

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTRIBUTION OR RESALE, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, MORTGAGED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR THE AVAILABILITY OF EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH REGISTRATION PROVISIONS.  
  
(c) The Grantee understands and agrees that neither the Company nor any agent of the Company shall be under any obligation to recognize and transfer any of the Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such transfer would result in violation by the Company of any federal or state law with respect to the offering, issuance or sale of securities.

  


6\. Adjustment for Stock Splits and the Like. All references to the number of Shares shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Shares that may be made by the Company after the date of this Agreement, as provided in Section 13 of the Plan.

  


7\. Tax Consequences.

  


(a) The Grantee has reviewed with the Grantee’s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign (if applicable) tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Grantee is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Grantee (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Grantee’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Grantee understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the Shares and the fair market value of the Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse. The Grantee understands that he/she may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are received rather than when and as the Repurchase Option expires by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of purchase.

* * *

  


(b) THE GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE GRANTEE’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY’S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF THE GRANTEE REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON THE GRANTEE’S BEHALF.

  


(c) If the Grantee makes any tax election relating to the treatment of the Shares under the Code, at the time of such election the Grantee shall promptly notify the Company of such election.

  


8\. General Provisions.

  


(a) This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the choice of law rules of any jurisdiction.

  


(b) In addition to the legend set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement, the certificates representing the Shares shall be endorsed with the following legend.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT AND TO THE RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS UPON TRANSFER. A COPY OF THE AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED TO ANY INTERESTED PARTY UPON WRITTEN REQUEST, WITHOUT CHARGE.  
  
(c) Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, one day after deposit with a recognized international delivery service (such as FedEx), or three days after deposit in the U.S. mail, first class, certified or registered, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid, in each case addressed to the parties at the addresses of the parties set forth at the end of this Agreement or such other address as a party may designate by notifying the other in writing.

  


(d) The rights and obligations of the Company and the Grantee hereunder shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against their respective successors and assigns, legal representatives and heirs. In addition, the rights and obligations of the Company under Section 2 of this Agreement shall be transferable to any one or more persons or entities as set forth therein.

  


(e) Either party’s failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement, except for the exercise by the Company of its Repurchase Option, shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent the party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of any party’s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.

* * *

(f) The Company and the Grantee agree, upon request, to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.

  


(g) THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT IN ANY MANNER OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE THE GRANTEE’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY.

  


(h) This Agreement expresses the entire understanding with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and terminates any prior oral or written agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended by a writing signed by both the Grantee and the Company.
