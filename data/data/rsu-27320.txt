In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) prior to the third anniversary of the Award Date, the continuing entity may either continue this Award or replace this Award with an award of substantially equivalent value with terms and conditions not less favorable than the terms and conditions provided in this Award Agreement, in which case the Award will vest according to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement. If the continuing entity does not so continue or replace this Award, or if you experience a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the letter agreement between you and OfficeMax regarding benefits upon a change in control), all units not vested at the time of the Change in Control or your termination (as applicable) will vest immediately.

6. The units awarded pursuant to this Agreement cannot be sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, transferred, or otherwise encumbered prior to vesting. Any attempt to transfer your rights in the awarded units prior to vesting will result in the immediate forfeiture of the units.

Vested restricted stock units will be paid to you in whole shares of OfficeMax common stock upon vesting, provided that if in OfficeMax’s good faith determination, some or all of the remuneration attributable to this payment is not deductible by OfficeMax for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code, then payment of such units will occur the day following the six month anniversary of your termination of employment with OfficeMax, and provided further that if in OfficeMax’s good faith determination this deferral could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of tax upon you with respect to the units prior to payment of the units, payment of all units will occur the day following the six month anniversary of your termination of employment with
