Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control any Installment of Covered Shares for which the Restricted Period has not expired as of the date of such Change in Control shall become vested immediately prior to the effective time of such Change in Control and such Installment shall be transferred to Grantee free of all restrictions otherwise imposed by this Agreement.

6\. Withholding. The grant and vesting of shares of Stock under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. At the election of Grantee, and subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Board from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied through the surrender of shares of Stock (a) which Grantee already owns, or (b) to which Grantee is otherwise entitled under the Plan; provided, however, that shares described in this clause (b) may be used to satisfy not more than the Company’s minimum statutory withholding obligation (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such taxable income).

7\. Dividends. Grantee shall not be prevented from receiving dividends and distributions paid on the Covered Shares merely because those shares are subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement and the Plan; provided, however that no dividends or distributions shall be payable to or for the benefit of Grantee with respect to record dates for such dividends or distributions for any Covered Shares occurring on or after the date, if any, on which Grantee has forfeited those shares.

8\. Voting. Grantee shall not be prevented from voting the Covered Shares merely because those shares are subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement and the Plan; provided, however, that Grantee shall not be entitled to vote Covered Shares with respect to record dates for any Covered Shares occurring on or after the date, if any, on which Grantee has forfeited those shares.

9\. Heirs and Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Company’s assets and business. If any rights of Grantee or benefits distributable to Grantee under this Agreement have not been exercised or distributed, respectively, at the time of Grantee’s death, such rights shall be exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary, and such benefits shall be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. If a deceased Grantee fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the Designated Beneficiary does not survive Grantee, any rights that would have been exercisable by Grantee and any benefits distributable to Grantee shall be exercised by or distributed to the legal representative of the estate of Grantee. If a deceased Grantee designates a beneficiary and the Designated Beneficiary survives Grantee but dies before the Designated Beneficiary’s exercise of all rights under this Agreement or before the complete distribution of benefits to the Designated Beneficiary under this Agreement, then any rights that would have been exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary shall be exercised by the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary, and any benefits distributable to the Designated Beneficiary shall be distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary.

12\. Fractional Shares. In lieu of issuing a fraction of a share of Stock resulting from an adjustment of the Award pursuant to Section 17.4 of the Plan or otherwise, the Company will be entitled to pay to Grantee an amount equal to the fair market value of such fractional share.

13\. Not An Employment Contract. The Award will not confer on Grantee any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Grantee’s Service at any time.

Any written notices provided for in this Agreement or the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given if either hand delivered or if sent by fax or overnight courier, or by postage paid first class mail. Notices sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing but in no event later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to Grantee, at Grantee’s address indicated by the Company’s records, or if to the Company, at the Company’s principal executive office.

The Company is unable to give Grantee any advice or counseling with respect to federal and state tax matters.
