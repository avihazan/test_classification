Section 3\. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or President, or by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors acting with or without a meeting, or by the persons who hold in the aggregate one-fifth of all the shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, upon notice in writing, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting. Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the objects stated in the call.

Section 4\. Notice of Special Meeting. Notice of a special meeting, in writing, stating the time, place and purpose thereof, shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat, not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty-five (35) days after the receipt of said request.

Section 5\. Waiver of Notice. Notice of any shareholders’ meeting may be waived in writing by any shareholder at any time before or after the meeting.

Section 6\. Quorum. At any meeting of the shareholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation, issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless otherwise specified by law or the Articles of Incorporation.

If, however, such majority shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, other than by announcement at the

1

* * *

  


meeting, until the requisite amount of voting stock shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

Section 7\. Voting.  At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such shareholder and bearing a date not more than eleven (11) months prior to said meeting, unless some other definite period of validity shall be expressly provided therein.

Each shareholder shall have one (1) vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in his or her name on the books of the Corporation, at the date fixed for determination of persons entitled to vote at the meeting or, if no date has been fixed, then at the date of the meeting. Cumulative voting shall be permitted only as expressly required by statute.

A complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at the shareholders’ meetings, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of voting shares held by each, shall be produced on the request of any shareholder, and such list shall be prima facie evidence of the ownership of shares and of the right of shareholders to vote, when certified by the Secretary or by the agent of the Corporation having charge of the transfer of shares.

Section 8\. Written Consent of Shareholders in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required or permitted by statute, the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, or these By-Laws, to be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if a written consent in lieu of a meeting, setting forth the actions so taken, shall be signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote thereon. Any such written consent may be given by one or any number of substantially concurrent written instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such shareholders, in person or by attorney or proxy duly appointed in writing, and filed with the records of the Corporation. Any such written consent shall be effective as of the effective date thereof as specified therein.

Directors shall be elected annually by the shareholders at the annual meeting, and each director shall hold office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. Any director may resign at any time. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled by the remaining members of the board. A director thus elected to fill any vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor and until his successor is elected and qualifies.

A Director shall be considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation’s request if his or her duties to the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him or her to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a Director.

C. “Expenses” include counsel fees.

E. “Official capacity” means:

(2) When used with respect to an individual other than a Director, as contemplated in Section 6, the office in the Corporation held by the officer or the employment or agency relationship undertaken by the employee or agent on behalf of the Corporation. “Official capacity” shall not include service for any other foreign or domestic corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.

F. “Party” includes an individual who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

G. “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal.

Section 2. Indemnification.

A. Except as provided in subsection (D) of this Section, the Corporation shall indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because he or she is or was a Director against liability incurred in the proceeding if:

(1) He or she conducted himself or herself in good faith; and

(2) He or she reasonably believed:

(a) In the case of conduct in his or her official capacity with the Corporation, that his or her conduct was in its best interest; and

(b) In all other cases, that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to its best interests; and

7

* * *

  


(3) In the case of any criminal proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

B. A Director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose he or she reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan shall be conduct that satisfies the requirement of subsection A(2)(b) of this Section.

C. The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not be, of itself, determinative that the Director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this Section.

D. The Corporation may not indemnify a Director under this Section:

(1) In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation in which the Director was adjudged liable to the Corporation; or

(2) In connection with any other proceeding charging improper personal benefit to him or her, whether or not involving action in his or her official capacity, in which he or she was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by him or her.

E. Indemnification permitted under this Section in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation shall be limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.

Section 3\. Mandatory Indemnification. Unless limited by the Articles of Incorporation, the Corporation shall indemnify a Director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was a party because he or she is or was a Director of the Corporation against reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding.

Section 4\. Advance for Expenses.

A. The Corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a Director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:

(1) The Director furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct described in Section 2;

(2) The Director furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet the standard of conduct; and

(3) A determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this article.

B. The undertaking required by subsection A(2) of this Section shall be an unlimited general obligation of the Director but shall not be required to be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

C. Determinations and authorizations of payments under this Section shall be made in the manner specified in Section 5.

8

* * *

  


Section 5\. Determination and Authorization of Indemnification.

A. The Corporation shall not indemnify a Director under Section 2 of this Article unless authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that indemnification of the Director is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 2.

B. The determination shall be made:

(1) By the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

(2) If a quorum cannot be obtained under subsection B(1) of this Section, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors (in which designation Directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more Directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

(3) By special legal counsel:

(a) Selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in subsection B(1) and (2) of this Section; or

(b) If a quorum of the Board of Directors cannot be obtained under subsection B(1) of this Section and a committee cannot be designated under subsection B(2) of this Section, selected by majority vote of the full Board of Directors (in which selection Directors who are parties may participate); or

(4) By the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of Directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding shall not be voted on the determination.

C. Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection B(3) of this Section to select counsel.

Section 6\. Indemnification of Officers, Employees, and Agents. Unless the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise:

A. An officer of the Corporation who is not a Director shall be entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 3, and is entitled to apply for court-ordered indemnification under the Kentucky Business Corporation Act, in each case to the same extent as a Director;

B. The Corporation may indemnify and advance expenses under this Article to an officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation who is not a Director to the same extent as to a Director; and

C. The Corporation may also indemnify and advance expenses to an officer, employee, or agent who is not a Director to the extent, consistent with public policy, that may be provided by the Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, general or specific action of the Board of Directors, or contract.

Section 7\. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or who, while a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, against liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in that capacity or arising from his or her status as a Director, officer, employee, or agent, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him or her against the same liability under either Section 2 or 3.

Section 8\. Application of this Article.

A. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the By-Laws, any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

B. This Article shall not limit the Corporation’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a Director in connection with his or her appearance as a witness at a proceeding at a time when he or she has not been made a named defendant or respondent to the proceeding.

ARTICLE VI

In case any officer designated for the purpose, who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been used on any such certificate, shall, from any cause, cease to be such officer before the certificate has been delivered by the Corporation, the certificate may nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person had not ceased to be such officer.
