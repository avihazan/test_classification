4. Restrictions and Conditions. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Participant shall forfeit any and all right to the Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock under this Award upon Participant’s termination of employment for Cause prior to the lapse of restrictions as provided in Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control Termination, occurs (a) within two years following the Change in Control or (b) prior to the lapse of restrictions under section 5, whichever occurs first; this Award shall be deemed earned at target performance level, and the restrictions shall be deemed lapsed as to such number of shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock determined by multiplying the total shares subject to this 

* * *

Award by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months in the Performance Period to the date of the Change in Control and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Performance Period.

5. Lapse of Restrictions. The Participant accepts this Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock Award and agrees that the restrictions relative to the Award shall lapse only following the conclusion of the Performance Period and only to the extent the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, that the Performance Contingency set forth on Appendix A to this Agreement has been met or exceeded. If the Administrator determines that:

(a) the Target level of performance has been achieved, the restrictions relative to all of the shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock shall lapse and the Participant shall become vested in all of such shares, 

(b)

the Threshold level of performance has been achieved, the restrictions relative to 50% of the shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock shall lapse and the Participant shall become vested in 50% of the Performance Contingent Restricted Stock, or  
  
(c)

performance has been achieved between the Threshold and Target levels of performance, the Administrator shall interpolate for performance between the Threshold and Target levels and shall determine the additional number of shares of Performance Contingent Restricted Stock as to which the restrictions shall lapse, such additional number to be determined by the Administrator in its discretion.  
  
Vesting of any shares under this Agreement shall occur on the date of the certification of the satisfaction of the Performance Contingency by the Board of Directors; provided, that no shares shall vest if Participant is terminated for Cause prior to the vesting date. Any shares as to which any or all of the Performance Contingency has not been satisfied shall be forfeited.

6. Shareholder Rights. Participant shall have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company with respect to shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock, including the right to vote and to receive dividends, but remain subject to the non-transferability restrictions set forth in Section 8 of this Agreement.

7. How Shares are Held. The Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock shall be held by a Company custodian until all of the restrictions have lapsed and all applicable terms and conditions have been met. The Company shall cause the shares of

8. Shares Non-Transferable. Shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock awarded hereunder shall not be transferable by Participant and may not be, sold, assigned, disposed of, or pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for performance of any obligation or for any other purpose until after the restrictions have lapsed as provided in Section 5.

10. Tax Withholding and Tax Election. The Company shall not be obligated to transfer any shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock until Participant pays to the Company in cash, or any other form of property acceptable to the Company, the amount required to be withheld for any federal, state or local income, FICA or other taxes of any kind with respect to such shares. The Participant may, by notice to the Company, elect to have such withholding satisfied by a reduction of the number of shares otherwise so deliverable, such reduction to be calculated based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the restrictions lapse as provided in Section 5. The Company and its subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct such taxes, from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Participant. Until the restrictions have lapsed as provided in Section 5, any dividends paid relative to the Performance Contingent Restricted Stock shall be treated as compensation and subject to tax withholdings in accordance with tax laws then in effect. 

The Participant may, but is not required to, elect to apply the rules of Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (“Code”) to the issuance of the shares of Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
