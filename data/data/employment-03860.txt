law, and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement or any application thereof shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of other provisions of this Agreement or of any other application of such provision shall in no way be affected thereby. 

9.5 Waiver of Rights. No waiver by ManTech or Executive of a right or remedy hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right or remedy or of any subsequent right or remedy of the same kind. 

9.6 Definitions; Headings; and Numbers. A term defined in any part of this Agreement shall have the defined meaning wherever such term is used herein. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Where appropriate to the context of this Agreement, use of the singular shall be deemed also to refer to the plural, and use of the plural to the singular. 

9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but both of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. 

9.8 Governing Laws and Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Parties hereto further agree that any action brought to enforce any right or obligation under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Page 9

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 

Lawrence B. Prior, III 

Agreement). The Executive’s entitlement to any compensation or benefits of a type not provided in this Agreement will be determined in accordance with the Company’s employee benefit plans and other applicable programs, policies and practices as in effect from time to time. 

9.12 Code Section 409A. (a) It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement shall either be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code (including the Treasury regulations and other published guidance relating thereto) (“ Code Section 409A ”) so as not to subject the Executive to payment of any interest or additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A. To the extent that any amount payable under this Agreement would trigger the additional tax, penalty or interest imposed by Code Section 409A, this Agreement shall be modified to avoid such additional tax, penalty or interest yet preserve (to the nearest extent reasonably possible) the intended benefit payable to the Executive. 

(b) To the extent a payment or benefit is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Code Section 409A (applying the default definition thereof) and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Executive is deemed on the date of a separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A, applying the default definition thereof) to be a “specified employee” (within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code and determined using any identification methodology and procedure selected by the Company from time to time, or, if none, the default methodology and procedure specified under Code Section 409A), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A and which is paid as a result of the Executive’s “separation from service,” such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided prior to the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the Executive, and (B) the date of the Executive’s death (the “Delay Period”). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this clause (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive without interest in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. 

(c) For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.

(d) With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Code Section 409A, (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, provided, that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section 105(b) of the Internal Revenue Code solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect; and (iii) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive’s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred
