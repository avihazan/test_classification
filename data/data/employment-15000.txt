Exhibit 99.1



THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made and effective as of the 21st day of July, 2015, by and between Diodes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Dr. Keh-Shew Lu (the "Employee"), with respect to the following facts:

The Company desires to be assured of the continued association and services of the Employee in order to take advantage of his experience, knowledge and abilities in the Company's business, and is willing to employ the Employee, and the Employee desires to be so employed, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

ACCORDINGLY, on the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. EMPLOYMENT

1.1 Employment. The Company hereby continues to employ the Employee as its President and Chief Executive Officer (or such other executive officer position designated by the Company’s Board of Directors and to which Executive expressly consents in writing), and the Employee hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and conditions set forth below, to perform during the term of this Agreement such services as are required hereunder.

1.2 Duties. The Employee shall render such services to the Company, and shall perform such executive duties and acts, as reasonably may be required by the Company's Board of Directors in connection with any aspect of the Company's business.

1.3 Performance of Duties.

(a) The Employee shall devote such reasonable time, ability and attention during normal business hours to his duties hereunder as may be necessary to discharge such duties in a professional and businesslike manner.

1.4 Indemnification. The Company shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Employee from, against and in respect of any and all payments, damages, claims, demands, losses, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities (including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs and the costs of investigation and preparation ) which, directly or indirectly, arise or result from or are related to the fact that the Employee is or was an employee, officer, director or agent of the Company. By way of evidencing such obligation and not limitation, the Company and the Employee have previously entered into an indemnification agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

1.5 Trade Secrets. The Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company's Board of Directors, disclose or use in any way, either during his employment by the Company or thereafter, except as required in the course of such employment, any confidential business or technical information or trade secret of the Company acquired in the course of such employment, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise protected by law, and whether or not conceived of or prepared by him (collectively, the "Trade Secrets"), including, without limitation, any confidential information concerning customer lists, products, procedures, operations, investments, financing, costs, employees, purchasing, accounting, marketing, merchandising, sales, salaries, pricing, profits and plans for future development, the identity, requirements, preferences, practices and methods of doing business of specific parties with whom the Company transacts business, and all other information which is related to any product, service or business of the Company, other than information which is (or becomes, other than as a result of the breach hereof by the Employee or any other employee of the Company) generally known in the industry in which the Company transacts business or is or may be acquired from public sources; all of which Trade Secrets are the exclusive and valuable property of the Company.

1.6 Noncompetition.

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term "Competitive Activity" shall mean any participation in, assistance of, employment by, ownership of any interest in, acceptance of business from or assistance, promotion or organization of any person, partnership, corporation, firm, association or other business organization, entity or enterprise which, directly or indirectly, is engaged in, or hereinafter engages in, the development, production, marketing or selling of any product which is the same as or in competition with any line of business in which the Company is engaged, whether as an agent, consultant, employee, officer, director, investor, partner, shareholder, proprietor or in any other individual or representative capacity, but excluding the holding for investment of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of any corporation which are regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange. Competitive Activity shall not be deemed to include personal investment activities (including venture capital) of the Employee.

-1-

* * *

(b) During his employment by the Company and for two (2) years thereafter, the Employee shall refrain, without the prior written consent of the Company in each instance, from engaging in any Competitive Activity which would be reasonably likely, as determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion, to result in the disclosure or use of any Trade Secrets.

1.7 Tangible Items. All files, accounts, records, documents, books, forms, notes, reports, memoranda, studies, compilations of information, correspondence and all copies, abstracts and summaries of the foregoing, and all other physical items related to the Company, other than a merely personal item, whether of a public nature or not, and whether prepared by the Employee or not, are and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company and shall not be removed from the premises of the Company, except as required in the course of employment by the Company, without the prior written consent of the Company's Board of Directors in each instance, and upon the request of the Company the same shall be promptly returned to the Company by the Employee on the expiration or termination of his employment by the Company or at any time prior thereto upon the request of the Company.

1.8 Solicitation of Employees. During his employment by the Company and for two (2) years thereafter, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, either for his own benefit or purposes or the benefit or purposes of any other person, employ or offer to employ, call on, solicit, interfere with or attempt to divert or entice away any employee or independent contractor of the Company (or any person whose employment or status as an independent contractor has terminated within the six (6) months preceding the date of such solicitation) in any capacity if that person possesses or has knowledge of any Trade Secrets of the Company.

1.9 Injunctive Relief. The Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that it would be difficult to fully compensate the Company for damages resulting from the breach or threatened breach of Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8 and, accordingly, that the Company shall be entitled to temporary and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, to enforce such provisions. This provision with respect to injunctive relief shall not, however, diminish the Company's right to claim and recover damages.

2\. COMPENSATION

2.1 Compensation. As the total consideration for the services which the Employee renders hereunder, the Employee shall be entitled to the following:

(i) an annual base salary of $623,000.00, subject to such periodic increases, if any, as the Board of Directors may determine, less any applicable deduction therefrom for income tax or other applicable withholdings, payable in accordance with the Company's standard practices and procedures;

(vii) a life insurance policy with a death benefit in an amount equal to that existing on the date of this Agreement, payable as directed by the Employee; and

(viii) a disability insurance policy in the maximum insurable amount as defined by the policy.

2.2 Illness. Subject to the limitations contained in Section 3.2(a)(iii) and 3.3(a) of this Agreement, if the Employee shall be unable to render the services required hereunder on account of personal injuries or physical or mental illness, he shall continue to receive all payments provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that any such payment may, at the sole option of the Company, be reduced by any amount that the Employee receives for the period covered by such payments as disability compensation under insurance policies, if any, maintained by the Company or under government programs.

3\. TERM AND TERMINATION

3.1 Term. Unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 3.2 or due to Employee’s death, the term of the Employee's employment by the Company under Section 1.1 shall commence on the date hereof and shall end on May 31, 2022 (the "Term").

3.2 At Will Relationship.

(a) The Employee and the Company each hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in Section 3.3, (i) the Employee's relationship with the Company under this Agreement is AT WILL and can be terminated at the option of either the Employee or the Company in his or its sole and absolute discretion, for any or no reason whatsoever, with or without cause, (ii) no representations, warranties or assurances have been made concerning the length of such relationship or the aggregate amount of compensation to be received by the Employee and (iii) after the termination of his employment by the Company, the Employee shall have no right, title or interest in or claim to any revenues received by the Company from any person for any goods sold or services rendered by the Company to such person, whether or not the Employee was the cause, in whole or in part, for such person to purchase such goods from the Company or to retain the Company to perform such services.

(b) The term "cause" shall mean:

(i) the willful and continued refusal of the Employee to substantially perform his duties in accordance with this Agreement (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), insubordination, or material violation of the Company's policies, in each case after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Employee by the Board of Directors of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board of Directors believes that the Employee has not substantially performed such duties, the acts constituting such insubordination, or such violations of the Company's policies, as the case may be, and the Employee shall have had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the same; or

(ii) the conviction of, or a plea of nolo contendere by, the Employee to a felony; or

(iii) a charge or indictment of a felony, the defense of which renders the Employee substantially unable to perform his duties under this Agreement.

For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Employee, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Employee shall not be deemed to be for cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Employee a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of all members of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board of Directors called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Employee and the Employee is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board of Directors), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, the Employee is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i), (ii), or (iii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

(c) Each of the following will constitute "good reason" for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Employee:

(i) a material diminution in Employee's base salary;

(ii) a material diminution in Employee's authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of this Agreement;

(iii) a material change in the geographic location at which Employee must perform services; or

(iv) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement.

-3-

* * *

For purposes of this provision, with respect to clauses (i) through (iv) above, "good reason" shall not exist unless Employee has notified the Company within thirty (30) days of the initial existence of the actions or failures to act giving rise to good reason, and such actions or failures have not been cured or remedied by the Company within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any termination by Employee for good reason under clauses (i) through (iv) above must occur within thirty (30) days following the date on which Employee provides the Company with the "Termination Notice" described under Section 3.2(d) below and such Termination Notice must be provided to the Company within 60 days after the foregoing cure/remedy has expired without cure or remedy by the Company.

(d) Any termination by the Company for cause, or by the Employee for good reason, shall be communicated by a written notice (the "Termination Notice") to the other party given in accordance with Section 4.6 of this Agreement, which notice shall (i) indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Employee's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the date of termination is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Employee or the Company to set forth in the Termination Notice any factor or circumstance which contributes to a showing of good reason or cause shall not waive any right of the Employee or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Employee or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Employee's or the Company's rights hereunder.

3.3 Duties Upon Termination.

(a) In the event that the Employee's employment by the Company under this Agreement is terminated by (a) the Company other than for "cause" (as defined above) which includes a termination by the Company due to Employee’s “Disability” (as defined in the Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan), or (b) the Employee for "good reason" (as defined above), neither the Company nor the Employee shall have any remaining duties or obligations hereunder, except that (i) the Company shall promptly pay or provide to the Employee, or his estate, the amount specified in Section 2.1(i), prorated through the date of termination, (ii) subject to Section 3.6, the Company shall continue to pay or provide (in accordance with the payment practices of Section 2.1(i)) to the Employee or his estate, the amount specified in Section 2.1(i) during the period commencing on the 60th day after the effective date of such termination (provided that such first installment shall be in an aggregate amount that would otherwise have been provided to Employee under Section 2.1(i) for such 60 day period) and ending on the first anniversary of such effective date, (iii) the Company shall pay to the Employee, or his estate, the amount specified in Section 2.1(iii) for the fiscal year in which such termination occurs, prorated to the date of the termination, (iv) subject to Section 3.6, the Company shall provide to the Employee continued participation in any group health plan or medical reimbursement plan on the terms existing on the date of termination for the period commencing on the effective date of such termination and ending on the earlier of 18 months thereafter or the date that the Company is otherwise unable to continue to cover Employee under its group health plans without penalty under applicable law (including without limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), (iv) all stock-based compensation previously granted to the Employee (including, but not limited to, all stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, bonus units and stock grants) shall continue to be governed by the applicable award agreement, and (v) the Employee shall continue to be bound by Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.

(b) In the event that the Employee's employment by the Company under this Agreement is terminated (a) by the Company for "cause" or (b) by the Employee other than for "good reason" or (c) due to Employee’s death, neither the Company nor the Employee shall have any remaining duties or obligations hereunder except that (i) the Company shall promptly pay or provide to the Employee, or his estate, the amount specified in Section 2.1(i), prorated through the date of termination, (ii) the Company shall pay to the Employee, or his estate, the amount specified in Section 2.1(iii) for the fiscal year in which such termination occurs, prorated to the date of the termination, (iii) all stock-based compensation previously granted to the Employee (including, but not limited to, all stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, bonus units and stock grants) shall continue to be governed by the applicable award agreement, and (iv) the Employee shall continue to be bound by Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.

3.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Employee's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Employee may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Employee may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Employee otherwise is entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the date of termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice, program, contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

3.5 Full Settlement. The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Employee or others; provided, however, that in the event the Employee shall obtain employment within one year from the date of termination, any amount payable by the Company to the Employee under Section 

-4-

* * *

3.3(a)(i) shall be reduced by any amount received by the Employee during such one year in connection with such other employment. In no event shall the Employee be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Employee under any provision of this Agreement.

3.6 Separation Agreement. The Company's obligation to provide the payments and benefits enumerated in Sections 3.3(a)(ii) and 3.3(a)(iv) is expressly conditioned upon the Employee’s timely execution, delivery to the Company, and non-revocation of (and Employee’s continuing compliance with) a separation agreement (which shall include without limitation a release by Employee of all of his claims against the Company and its affiliates) in a form prescribed by the Company (the “Separation Agreement”). The Separation Agreement must be executed by Employee and delivered to the Company and become irrevocable by its own terms within no more than fifty-five (55) days after the date of termination of Employee’s employment with the Company.

No supplement, modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be valid unless executed by the party to be bound thereby.

From and after the date hereof, neither the Company nor the Employee shall have any further rights or obligations whatsoever under the Prior Agreements.

4.12 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of Texas or the United States of America sitting in the City of Dallas over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii) waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the establishment of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that a judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of Texas (or any other courts to the jurisdiction of which such party is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment and (iv) consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address of such party specified in or designated pursuant to Section 4.6.

4.13 Construction. This Agreement was reviewed by legal counsel for each party hereto and is the product of informed negotiations between the parties hereto.

Each party hereto acknowledges that no party was in a superior bargaining position regarding the substantive terms of this Agreement.

4.14 Section 409A.

(a) This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"), and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A.

(b) The parties agree that if any payment or the provision of any amount, benefit or entitlement hereunder at the time specified in this Agreement would subject Employee to any additional tax or interest or penalties under Section 409A, the payment or provision of such amount, benefit or entitlement shall be postponed to the earliest commencement date on which the payment or the provision of such amount, benefit or entitlement could be made without incurring such additional tax, interest or penalties (including delaying payment of any severance to the earliest possible payment date which is consistent with Section 409A). In addition, to the extent that any regulations or guidance issued under Section 409A (after application of the previous provision of this paragraph) would result in Employee being subject to the payment of interest, penalties or any additional tax under Section 409A, the Company and Employee agree, to the extent reasonably possible, to amend this Agreement in order to avoid the imposition of any such interest, penalties or additional tax under Section 409A, which amendment shall be reasonably determined in good faith by the Company and Employee.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all payments not otherwise exempt from Section 409A which are to be made after a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made after Employee experiences a "separation from service" as such term is defined under Section 409A. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during Employee's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

(d) If upon Employee's "separation from service" from the Company, Employee is then a "specified employee" (as defined by and determined in accordance with Section 409A), then solely to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A and avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A, the Company shall defer payment of "nonqualified deferred compensation," subject to Section 409A, which is payable as a result of and would otherwise be paid within six (6) months following such separation from service, until the earlier of (a) the first business day of the seventh month after Employee's separation from service, or (b) ten (10) days after the Company receives written notice of Employee's death. All
