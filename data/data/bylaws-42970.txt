Section 1.

Certificates. Shares of Alliance One International, Inc. (the “Corporation”) shall be evidenced by certificates in forms prescribed by the Board of Directors and executed in any manner permitted by law and stating thereon the information required by law. Transfer books in which shares shall be transferred shall be kept by the Corporation or by one or more transfer agents appointed by it. A record shall be kept of each share certificate that is issued. The Corporation shall have the right to appoint at any time or from time to time one or more registrars of its capital shares.

  


Section 2.

After receiving notice from a shareholder of any loss, destruction or mutilation of a share certificate, the Secretary or his nominee may in his discretion cause one or more new certificates for the same number of shares in the aggregate to be issued to such shareholder upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or upon satisfactory proof of such loss or destruction and the deposit of a bond in such form and amount and with such surety as the Secretary or his nominee may require.

  


Section 4.

Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than seventy (70) days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notices of the meeting are first mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders.

  


ARTICLE II

  


Shareholders

  


Section 1.

Annual Meeting. Subject to the Board of Directors' ability to postpone a meeting under Virginia law, the annual meeting shall be held on such date and at such time and place as may be fixed by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. The annual meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of only such other business as is properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these bylaws. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be in writing and delivered or mailed to and received by the Secretary not less than sixty (60) days before the first anniversary of the date of the Corporation's proxy statement in connection with the last annual meeting. A shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iii) the class, series and number of the Corporation's shares that are beneficially owned by the shareholder, and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II (Section 1); provided, however, that nothing in this Article II (Section 1) shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting. In the event that a shareholder attempts to bring business before an annual meeting without complying with the provisions of this Article II (Section 1), the chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that the business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, and, if he shall so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

  


Section 2.

Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be held at any time and at any place designated in the notice thereof upon call of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the Board of Directors. 

  


Section 3.

Notice. Notice in writing of every annual or special meeting of the shareholders, stating the date, time and place, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be mailed not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before any such meeting to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, at his address as it appears in the share transfer books of the Corporation. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law, but meetings may be held without notice if all of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting waive such notice, by attendance at the meeting or otherwise, in accordance with law.

  


Section 4.

Quorum. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by any voting group on any matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of such voting group with respect to action on such matter. If at the time and place of the meeting there be present less than a quorum, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the Chairman or by the vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy without notice other than announcement at the meeting. 

  


Section 5.

Voting. Except as otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, at all meetings of the shareholders, each holder of an outstanding share may vote in person or by proxy, and shall be entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at such meeting for each share registered in the name of such shareholder on the books of the Corporation on the record date for such meeting. Every proxy shall be in writing, dated and signed by the shareholder entitled to vote or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. 

  


Unless a greater vote is required pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation or the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, if a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of Directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast by shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

  


Section 6.

Presiding Officer. All meetings of the shareholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in his absence or at his request, by the Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of the Chief Executive Officer, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person appointed by the Board. The presiding officer shall have the power to adjourn the meeting. In case none of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or other Board-appointed presiding officer is present, the meeting shall elect a chairman. The Secretary or, in his absence or at his request, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of such meetings.

Section 7. 

Inspectors and Tellers. An appropriate number of inspectors and tellers for any meeting of the shareholders may be appointed by or pursuant to the direction of the Board of Directors.
