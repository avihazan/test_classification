NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED by and between the Company and the Participant, as follows: 

1\. Terms of Award. The following terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in this paragraph 1:

Other terms used in this Agreement are defined in paragraph 9, elsewhere in this Agreement, or in the Plan. 

2\. Award and Exercise Price.

The number of Covered Shares and the Exercise Price shall be adjusted in the event of a stock dividend, stock split or similar distribution.

provided, however, that in the event of a Participant’s death, Retirement, Disability or a Change in Control (each as defined in paragraph 9), any Option then outstanding shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable. 

4\. Expiration. Subject to the terms of Section 6(d) of the Plan, the Option shall not be exercisable on or after the Expiration Date. The “Expiration Date” shall be earliest to occur of: 

a.

the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date;   
  
b.

if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs by reason of Retirement, the thirty-six month anniversary of such Date of Termination;   
  
c.

if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs by reason of death or Disability, the twelve month anniversary of such Date of Termination;   
  
d.

if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs for reasons other than death, Disability, or Retirement, ninety days after such Date of Termination, only as to that portion of the Covered Shares that were exercisable immediately prior to the Date of Termination; or   
  
e.

if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs for cause (as determined by the Committee or the Board of Directors), on the Date of Termination.   
  
5\. Method of Option Exercise. Subject to the Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Company at its corporate headquarters prior to the Expiration Date. Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock which the Participant elects to purchase, and shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for such shares of Stock indicated by the Participant’s election. Payment shall be by cash or by check payable to the Company. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised: (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by the Participant by delivery of shares of Stock or attestation of the fact of ownership thereof acceptable to the Committee and having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the exercise date) equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, if required at the Company’s discretion. The Option may not be exercised with respect to fractional Covered Shares. 

6\. Withholding. All deliveries and distributions under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied through payment by cash or check, or by the surrender of shares of Stock which the Participant already owns or to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan.

7\. Transferability. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, the Option is not transferable other than as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during the Participant’s life, may be exercised only by the Participant. 

8\. Non-Solicitation. In consideration of the grant of the Option, the Participant agrees that during the term of his employment by the Company or its Subsidiary and until one year after Participant’s Date of Termination, he will not engage, directly or indirectly, whether on his own, as employee, or as an agent, consultant, or advisor of any business (including, without limitation, any financial institution, or any other firm, corporation, partnership, or other entity) in any or all of the following activities: 

a.

Canvassing, soliciting or causing the acceptance of any business from, or offering to render services to, any of the Company’s customers, or causing anyone else to do so, other than in the performance of his duties as an employee of the Company or for any entity that is not competing in any way with the Company; or   
  
b.

Requesting or advising any of the Company’s customers to withdraw or cancel any of their business with the Company, or causing anyone else to do so; or   
  
c.

Soliciting or attempting to persuade any employee of the Company to terminate his services with the Company, or causing anyone else to do so.   
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8 shall be of no further force or effect upon a Change in Control of the Company.

If, as a result of a sale or other transaction, the Participant’s employer ceases to be a Subsidiary (and the Participant’s employer is or becomes an entity that is separate from the Company), the occurrence of such transaction shall be treated as the Participant’s Date of Termination.

13\. Not an Employment Contract. The Option will not confer on the Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Participant’s employment or other service at any time. 

14\. Notices. Any written notices provided for in this Agreement or the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given if either hand delivered or if sent by fax or overnight courier, or by postage paid first class mail. Notices sent by mail shall be
