RESALE OF STOCK ISSUED ON EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION WILL BE RESTRICTED

  


Dear _______________________________ (“Grantee”):

In view of your substantial contributions toward the achievement of the business goals and objectives of DNB Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") and DNB First, National Association (the "Bank") and the expectation of your future contributions, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is pleased to award you an option to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation pursuant to the 1995 Stock Option Plan of DNB Financial Corporation (As amended and restated, effective as of April 27, 2004) (the "Plan"). This letter will serve as the stock option agreement between you and the Corporation. The option awarded to you is subject to the following terms.

1.NUMBER OF SHARES: You are awarded an option to purchase a total of ___________________________________ (_____) shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan.

2.RESALE RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES:

(a) When issued, your resale or other disposition of these shares will be restricted for two (2) years from the date the Common Stock is issued to you, on the following terms and will bear the following legend:

“Sale, assignment, pledge, gift, or any other disposition, alienation or encumbrance of the shares represented by this certificate are restricted and prohibited until ______________, _____ pursuant to the terms of a Stock Option Agreement dated April 23, 2010, between DNB Financial Corporation and the holder of the shares named on this certificate, which may be examined at the principal office of the Company, and such shares may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, given or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered only upon compliance with the terms of that Agreement.”

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section (but subject to subsection (c) of this Section), upon and after issuance of the shares on your exercise of this option, you will be authorized to resell these shares free of the restriction set forth in subsection (a) of this Section solely for the purpose of securing funds to satisfy federal, state or local withholding taxes applicable to your exercise of this stock option.

(c) Even if you are permitted to resell these shares free of the restriction described in subsection (a) of this Section, resale may nevertheless be restricted for other reasons under applicable securities laws. For example, if you are an “affiliate” of the Corporation, your resale of the Common Stock you receive on exercise of an Option will be subject to resale restrictions. A person who is an “affiliate” of the Corporation may not resell shares of Common Stock received by such employee upon exercise of Options under the Plan, except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or in accordance with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or anoth er exemption available under the Securities Act. For purposes of the Securities Act, an employee will be considered to be an “affiliate” of the Corporation if such employee directly or indirectly controls the Corporation. In addition, under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), if you are a director or one of certain types of “officer” of the Corporation identified in SEC regulations under Section 16(b), you may be liable to the Corporation for profit you are deemed to realize if you make certain types of purchases and certain types of sales of the Common Stock within a period of less than six months of each other. You should consult with legal counsel as to your status as an “affiliate” of the Corporation and the applicability of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to you.

* * *

3.TYPE OF OPTION: The option awarded to you is a Non-Qualified Option as that term is defined in the Plan.

4.EXERCISE PRICE: The shares may be purchased upon your exercise of this option for the price of six dollars and ninety-three cents ($6.93) per share

5.DATE OF GRANT OF AWARD: The Grant Date of the award of this option is April 23, 2010, which is also the date of this Agreement.

6.STATED EXPIRATION DATE: Unless earlier terminated as explained below, the option awarded to you expires (with respect to any number of shares subject to this option not previously exercised) on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Grant Date stated above. This is the Stated Expiration Date.

7.DATE OPTION BECOMES EXERCISABLE; LOSS OF OPTION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: The stock option awarded to you is exercisable only at and after such time as the market value of the Common Stock first equals or exceeds seven dollars and ninety-seven cents ($7.97), which is one hundred and fifteen percent (115%) of the exercise price stated above, and then only after the earlier of (a) the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Grant Date stated above, (b) your death, (c) your termination of service on account of disability, (d) the date of a change in control of the Corporation, as defined below, or (e) your retirement at or after attainment of age sixty-five (65), provided that your rights under this stock option shall be forfeited in the event of your termination prior to the first to occur of such events.

Upon any attempt by you to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this option or of any portion thereof or upon the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process on this option or on any portion thereof, the option awarded to you will immediately expire with respect to the number of shares not exercised prior to such event.

11.RIGHTS IN SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION: You will not be treated as a holder of any of the shares subject to this option or of any rights of a holder of such shares unless and until the shares are issued to you as evidenced by stock certificates.

You hereby acknowledge and agree, therefore, that the Corporation has an independent obligation to comply, and to determine compliance with, EESA, and for that reason you agree that the Corporation shall be entitled to determine, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, whether the prohibition set forth in Section 111(b)(3)(C) of EESA apply or no longer apply, and in doing so the Corporation shall be entitled to rely conclusively on an opinion of independent legal counsel acceptable to the Corporation, and such determination by the Corporation, if made in conformance with such opinion and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, shall be binding upon you.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation and the Grantee have duly executed this Agreement as of the Grant Date.
