(c) 

If within a period of 60 days of the receipt of the Offer the Optionee notifies the Optionor in writing that it will accept the Offer, the Optionor shall be bound to sell such interest to

(d) 

If the Optionee fails to notify the Optionor before the expiration of the time limited therefor that it will purchase the interest offered, the Optionor may sell and transfer such interest to the Proposed Purchaser at the price and on the terms and conditions specified in the Offer for a period of 60 days, but the terms of this paragraph shall again apply to such interest if the sale to the Proposed Purchaser is not completed within such 60 days.  
  
(e) 

Any sale hereunder shall be conditional upon the Proposed Purchaser delivering a written undertaking to the Optionee, in form and substance satisfactory to its counsel, to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
