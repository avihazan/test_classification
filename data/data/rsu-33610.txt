Such option is evidenced by option certificates in the form attached hereto as Schedule 1a, Schedule 1b, Schedule 1c and Schedule 1d (such instrument being hereinafter referred to as an “Option,” and such Option and all instruments hereafter issued in replacement, substitution, combination or subdivision thereof being hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Option”).

The Option will be exercisable by the Option Holder (as defined below) as to all or any lesser number of shares of Common Stock covered thereby, at an initial purchase price of US $[___] per share (the “Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5 below, which shall vest to the Holder as provided in Section 3(a) below, for the exercise period defined in Section 3(b) below.

  


1\.

The Company represents and warrants to the Option Holder as follows:

(b)

Certificates representing the Shares, which are not registered as provided in this Section 2, shall bear an appropriate legend and be subject to a “stop-transfer” order.  
  
  


3\. 

Vesting of Option, Exercise of Option, Partial Exercise, Notice.  
  
  


(a) 

Vesting Period. Options to purchase [______] shares shall vest upon the expiration of each year that elapses from [________________](the “Effective Date”) (with options to purchase the first [______] shares vesting on [________________]), until Holder has vested the entire Option, provided that the entire Option shall vest to Holder immediately upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" as defined under the Company’s 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which includes:  
  
  


(1) 

the adoption of a plan of merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation or association as a result of which the holders of the voting capital stock of the Company as a group would receive less than 50% of the voting capital stock of the surviving or resulting corporation;  
  
  


(2) 

the approval by the Board of Directors of the Company of an agreement providing for the sale or transfer of substantially all the assets of the Company; or  
  
  


(3) 

in the absence of a prior expression of approval by the Board of Directors, the acquisition of more than 20% of the Company's voting capital stock by any person within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Act (other than the Company or a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company);  
  
  


Provided that Holder shall cease to continue vesting the Option as provided above, upon the later of (a) the termination of Holder’s employment with the Company, or (b) in the case the Holder is a Director of the Company on the Grant Date, the date such Director ceases to serve as a Director of the Company (each a “Termination Date”), as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion.

  


(b) 

Exercise Period. This Option shall expire and all rights hereunder shall be extinguished upon the earlier of:  
  
  


(i) 

Ten (10) years from the Grant Date; or  
  
  


(ii) 

Three (3) Months from the date Holder’s employment with the Company ceases (or in the case of a Director of the Company, the date such Director ceases to serve as a Director of the Company), as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion, unless such employment shall have terminated:  
  
  


(1)

as a result of the Disability of Holder, as defined in the Plan, in which event such exercise period shall expire on the date twelve (12) months following such termination of service by the Company, not to exceed the time period specified in Section 3(b)(i) above; or  
  
  


(2)

as a result of the death of Holder (other than as a result of disability), in which event such exercise period shall expire on the date twelve (12) months after the date of Holder’s death, not to exceed the time period specified in Section 3(b)(i) above.  
  
  


2 / 6

* * *

(c) 

Exercise in Full. Subject to Section 3(a) and 3(b), the Option may be exercised in full by the Option Holder by surrender of the Option, with the Form of Subscription attached hereto as Schedule 2 executed by such Option Holder, to the Company, accompanied by payment as determined by 3(e) below, in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of Shares represented by the respective Option by the Purchase Price per share (after giving effect to any adjustments as provided in Section 5 below).  
  
  


(d) 

Partial Exercise. Subject to Section 3(a) and 3(b), each Option may be exercised in part by the Option Holder by surrender of the Option, with the Form of Subscription attached hereto as Schedule 2 at the end thereof duly executed by such Option Holder, in the manner and at the place provided in Section 3(c) above, accompanied by payment as determined by 3(e) below, in amount obtained by multiplying the number of Shares designated by the Option Holder in the Form of Subscription attached hereto as Schedule 2 to the Option by the Purchase Price per share (after giving effect to any adjustments as provided in Section 5 below). Upon any such partial exercise, the Company at its expense will forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order of the Option Holder a new Option of like tenor, in the name of the Option Holder, calling in the aggregate for the purchase of the number of Shares equal to the number of such Shares called for on the face of the respective Option (after giving effect to any adjustment herein as provided in Section 5 below) minus the number of such Shares designated by the Option Holder in the aforementioned form of subscription.  
  
  


(e) 

Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price may be made by any of the following or a combination thereof, at the election of the Option Holder:  
  
  


(i)

In cash, by wire transfer, by certified or cashier’s check, or by money order; or  
  
  


(ii)

By delivery to the Company of an exercise notice that requests the Company to issue to the Option Holder the full number of shares as to which the Option is then exercisable, less the number of shares that have an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion at the time of exercise, equal to the aggregate purchase price of the shares to which such exercise relates. (This method of exercise allows the Option Holder to use a portion of the shares issuable at the time of exercise as payment for the shares to which the Option relates and is often referred to as a "cashless exercise." For example, if the Option Holder elects to exercise 1,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.25 and the current Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of exercise is $1.00, the Option Holder can use 250 of the 1,000 shares at $1.00 per share to pay for the exercise of the entire Option (250 x $1.00 = $250.00) and receive only the remaining 750 shares).  
  
  


For purposes of this section, "Fair Market Value” shall be defined as the average closing price of the Common Stock (if actual sales price information on any trading day is not available, the closing bid price shall be used) for the five trading days prior to the date of exercise of this Option (the “Average Closing Bid Price”), as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (“NASDAQ”), or if the Common Stock is not traded on NASDAQ, the Average Closing Bid Price in the over-the-counter market; provided, however, that if the Common Stock is listed on a stock exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the Average Closing Bid Price on such exchange; and, provided further, that if the Common Stock is not quoted or listed by any organization, the fair value of the Common Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive, shall be used). In no event shall the Fair Market Value of any share of Common Stock be less than its par value.

4\. 

Delivery of Stock Certificates on Exercise.  
  
  


Any exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 3 shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the Option together with the Form of Subscription and the payment for the aggregate Purchase Price shall have been received by the Company. At such time, the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates representing the Shares or Other Securities (as defined below) shall be issuable upon such exercise shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the Shares or Other Securities so purchased. As soon as practicable after the exercise of any Option in full or in part, and in any event within Ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to the purchasing Option Holder, a certificate or certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock or Other Securities to which such Option Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise, plus in lieu of any fractional share to which such Option Holder would otherwise be entitled, cash in an amount determined pursuant to Section 6(e). The term “Other Securities” refers to any stock (other than Common Stock), other securities or assets (including cash) of the Company or any other person (corporate or otherwise) which the Option Holder at any time shall be entitled to receive, or shall have received, upon the exercise of the Option, in lieu of or in addition to Common Stock, or which at any time shall be issuable or shall have been issued in exchange for or in replacement of Common Stock or Other Securities pursuant to Section 5 below or otherwise. “Business Day” means a day other than (i) a Saturday, (ii) a Sunday or (iii) a day on which commercial banks in the City of Houston, Texas are authorized or required to be closed for business.

  


5\. 

Adjustment of Purchase Price and Number of Shares Purchasable.  
  
  


The Purchase Price and the number of Shares are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 5.

  


(a) 

In case the Company shall at any time after the date of this Option Agreement (i) declare a dividend on the Common Stock in shares of its capital stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock by reclassification of the Common Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation), then in each case the Purchase Price, and the number and kind of Shares receivable upon exercise, in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination, or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Option exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of Shares which, if such Option had been exercised immediately prior to such record date, he would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination, or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur.  
  
  


(b) 

No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required if such adjustment is less than US $0.01; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (b) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-thousandth of a share, as the case may be.  
  
  


(c) 

Upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in subsection (a) of this Section 5, the Option outstanding prior to the making of the adjustment in the Purchase Price shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of Shares (calculated to the nearest thousandth) obtained by (i) multiplying the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Option immediately prior to adjustment of the number of Shares by the Purchase Price in effect prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.

Further Covenants of the Company.  
  
  


(a) 

Dilution or Impairments. The Company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger or dissolution, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the Option or of this Option Agreement, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Option Holder against dilution or other impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company:  
  
  


(i) 

shall at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the exercise of the Option, all shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to time issuable upon the exercise of the Option and shall take all necessary actions to ensure that the par value per share, if any, of the Common Stock (or Other Securities) is at all times equal to or less than the then effective Purchase Price per share; and  
  
  


(ii) 

will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock or Other Securities upon the exercise of the Option from time to time outstanding.  
  
  


(b) 

Title to Stock. All Shares delivered upon the exercise of the Option shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; each Option Holder shall, upon such delivery, receive good and marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of all voting and other trust arrangements, liens, encumbrances, equities and claims whatsoever; and the Company shall have paid all taxes, if any, in respect of the issuance thereof.  
  
  


(c) 

Replacement of Option. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Option and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Option, the Company, at the expense of the Option Holder, will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Option of like tenor.  
  
  


(d) 

Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares are to be issued upon the exercise of any Option, but the Company shall round any fraction of a share to the nearest whole Share.  
  
  


7\. 

Holders of Shares.  
  
  


(a) 

The Option is issued upon the following terms, to all of which each Option Holder by the taking thereof consents and agrees: any person who shall become a holder or owner of Shares shall take such shares subject to the provisions of Section 2(b) hereof; each prior taker or owner waives and renounces all of his equities or rights in such Option in favor of each such permitted bona fide purchaser, and each such permitted bona fide purchaser shall acquire absolute title thereto and to all rights presented thereby.  
  
  


(b) 

The Option Holder shall notify the Company if such Option Holder sells or otherwise transfers any shares of Common Stock of the Company acquired upon exercise of the Option within two (2) years of the Grant Date of such Option or within one (1) year of the date such shares were acquired upon exercise of this Option.
