# 3. Dividend Equivalents. With respect to each cash dividend or distribution (if any) paid with respect to Common Stock to holders of record on and after the Grant Date, a number of shares of Common Stock shall be accrued on the books and records of the Company, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of such dividend or distribution paid with respect to one share of Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the number of vested RSUs (if any) granted hereunder then held by the Employee. At such time(s) thereafter as the Employee receives a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of his or her vested RSUs granted hereunder pursuant to the applicable provision of Section 2 above, the Company shall also distribute to the Employee such number of shares of Common Stock accrued under this Section 3 that relate to the vested RSUs in respect of which such distribution of shares is otherwise being made. In the event of any stock dividend, the provisions of Section 8 of the Plan shall apply to this Restricted Stock Unit Award.

* * *

  


Company become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation, unless as otherwise provided for herein. This Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor shall any assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under this Agreement.

5. Rights as a Stockholder. The Employee shall not have any rights of a common stockholder of the Company unless and until the Employee becomes entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 2 above. As soon as practicable following the date that the Employee becomes entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 2, certificates for the Common Stock shall be delivered to the Employee or to the Employee’s legal guardian or representative.

6. Transferability. The RSUs shall not be subject to alienation, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, and any attempt to cause any such awards to be so subjected shall not be recognized. The shares of Common Stock acquired by the Employee pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement may not at any time be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition complies with applicable securities laws.

7. Purchaser’s Employment by the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to employ the Employee in any capacity whatsoever or prohibits or restricts the Company (or any Subsidiary) from terminating the employment, if any, of the Employee at any time or for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause, and the Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person has made any representations or promises whatsoever to the Employee concerning the Employee’s employment or continued employment by the Company or any Affiliate thereof.

8. Change in Capitalization. In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock split, spin-off, stock dividend, stock combination or reclassification, recapitalization or merger, change of control, or similar event, the provisions of Section 8 of the Plan shall govern the treatment of this Restricted Stock Unit Award.

# 9. Withholding. It shall be a condition of the obligation of the Company upon delivery of Common Stock to the Employee pursuant to Section 2 above that the Employee pay to the Company such amount as may be requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying any liability for any federal, state or local income or other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such Common Stock. The Company shall be authorized to take such action as may be necessary, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel (including, without limitation, withholding Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Employee hereunder and/or withholding amounts from any compensation or other amount owing from the Company to the Employee), to satisfy the obligations for payment of the minimum amount of any such taxes. In addition, if the Company’s accountants determine that there would be no adverse accounting implications to the Company, the Employee may be permitted to elect to use Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Employee hereunder to satisfy any such obligations, subject to such procedures as the Company’s accountants may require. The Employee is hereby advised to seek his own tax counsel regarding the taxation of the grant of RSUs made hereunder.

10. Securities Laws. Upon the delivery of any Common Stock to the Employee, the Company may require the Employee to make or enter into such written representations, warranties and agreements as the Committee may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securities laws or with this Agreement. The delivery of the Common Stock hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals of any governmental agencies as may be required.

11. Section 409A of the Code. In the event that it is reasonably determined by the Company that, as a result of the deferred compensation tax rules under Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) (“the Deferred Compensation Tax Rules”), benefits that the Employee is entitled to under the terms of this Agreement may not be made at the time contemplated by the terms hereof or thereof, as the case may be, without causing Employee to be subject to tax under the Deferred Compensation Tax Rules, the Company shall, in lieu of providing such benefit when otherwise due under this Agreement, instead provide such benefit on the first day on which such provision would not result in the Employee incurring any tax liability under the Deferred Compensation Tax Rules; which day, if the Employee is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of the Deferred Compensation Tax Rules), may, in the event the benefit to be provided is due to the Employee’s “separation from service” (within the meaning of the Deferred Compensation Tax Rules) with the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be the first day following the six-month period beginning on the date of such separation from service.

12. Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement to the Company shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Secretary, and any notice to be given to the Employee shall be addressed to him at the address given beneath his signature hereto. By a notice given pursuant to this Section 12, either party may hereafter designate a different address for notices to be given to him. Any notice which is required to be given to the Employee shall, if the Employee is then deceased, be given to the Employee’s personal representative if such representative has previously informed the Company of his status and address by written notice under this Section 12. Any notice shall have been deemed duly given when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope or wrapper addressed as aforesaid, deposited (with postage prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service

13. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Delaware (or if the Company reincorporates in another state, the laws of that state) shall govern the interpretation, validity and performance of the terms of this Agreement regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflicts of laws.

14. Restricted Stock Unit Award Subject to Plan. The Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to all applicable terms and provisions of the Plan, to the extent applicable to the Common Stock. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.

15. Signature in Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
