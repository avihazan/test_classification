Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), a restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) of _____ restricted stock units, upon and subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions set forth below. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan. 

1\. Award Subject to Acceptance of Agreement. The Award shall be null and void unless the Employee shall accept this Agreement by executing it in the space provided below and returning it to the Company. 

2\. Restriction Period and Vesting. (a) Subject to Section 2(e), the Award shall vest (i) with respect to one-quarter (1/4) of the restricted stock units subject to the Award on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, an additional one-quarter (1/4) of the restricted stock units subject to the Award on the second anniversary of the Grant Date, an additional one-quarter (1/4) of the restricted stock units subject to the Award on the third anniversary of the Grant Date, and the remaining one-quarter (1/4) of the restricted stock units subject to the Award on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date, or (ii) earlier pursuant to Section 2(b) or (d) hereof (the “Restriction Period”). 

(b) Subject to Section 2(e), if the Company terminates the Employee’s employment by reason of permanent disability or the Employee’s employment terminates due to death, the Award shall become fully vested as of the effective date of the Employee’s termination of employment or the date of death, as the case may be. For purposes of this Agreement, “permanent disability” shall mean the inability of the Employee to substantially perform his or her duties for a continuous period of at least six months as determined by the Committee. 

(c) Subject to Section 2(e), if the Employee’s employment by the Company terminates for any reason other than permanent disability or death, the portion of the Award, if any, which is not vested as of the effective date of the Employee’s termination of employment shall be forfeited and cancelled by the Company. 

(d) (1) In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Appendix A), the Award shall immediately vest in full. 

(2) In the event of a Change in Control pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of Appendix A, the Board of Directors (as constituted prior to such Change in Control) may, in its discretion (subject to existing contractual arrangements): 

(i) require that shares of stock of the corporation resulting from such Change in Control, or a parent corporation thereof, be substituted for some or all of the Shares (as defined in Section 3) issuable pursuant to the Award, as determined by the Board of Directors; and/or  
  
* * *

##### 

(ii) require the Award, in whole or in part, to be surrendered to the Company by the Employee and to be immediately cancelled by the Company, and provide for the Employee to receive a cash payment in an amount not less than the amount determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units subject to the Award immediately prior to such cancellation (but after giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 12.4 of the Plan in respect of any transaction that gives rise to such Change in Control) by the highest per share price offered to holders of shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value per share (the “Common Stock”), in any transaction whereby the Change in Control takes place.  
  
(3) The Company may, but is not required to, cooperate with the Employee if the Employee is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), to assure that any cash payment or substitution in accordance with the foregoing to the Employee is made in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

(e) The vesting terms in any written employment agreement between the Company or any Affiliate of the Company and the Employee shall prevail over the terms of this Agreement. 

3\. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units and Issuance of Shares. Upon the vesting of all or any portion of the Award in accordance with Section 2 hereof, one share of the Common Stock shall be issuable for each restricted stock unit that vests on such date (the “Shares”), subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, and not later than 30 days thereafter, the Company will transfer such Shares to the Employee upon satisfaction of any required tax withholding obligations. No fractional shares shall be issued under this Agreement. 

4\. No Rights as a Shareholder; Dividend Equivalents. Prior to the issuance and transfer of Shares upon vesting, the Employee will be credited with amounts equal to any cash dividends that would be payable to the Employee if the Employee had been transferred such Shares, which amounts shall accrue during the Restriction Period and be paid in cash upon lapse of the Restriction Period. This Section 4 will not apply with respect to record dates for dividends occurring prior to the Grant Date or after the Restriction Period has lapsed. During the Restriction Period, the Employee (and any person succeeding to the Employee’s rights pursuant to the Plan) will not be a shareholder of record of the Shares underlying the Award and will have no voting or other shareholder rights with respect to such Shares. 

5\. Termination of Award. In the event that the Employee shall forfeit all or a portion of the restricted stock units subject to the Award, the Employee shall promptly return this Agreement to the Company for cancellation. Such cancellation shall be effective regardless of whether the Employee returns this Agreement.

6\. Additional Terms and Conditions of Award. 

6.1 Nontransferability of Award. During the Restriction Period, the restricted stock units subject to the Award and not then vested may not be transferred by the Employee other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to Section 12.5 of the Plan on a beneficiary designation form approved by the Company. Except as permitted by the foregoing, during the Restriction Period, the restricted stock units subject to the Award and not then vested may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) or be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any such attempted sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or encumbrance, or other disposition of such shares shall be null and void. 

6.2. Withholding Taxes. As a condition precedent to the delivery to the Employee of any of the Shares subject to the Award, the Employee shall, upon request by the Company, pay to the Company (or shall cause a broker-dealer on behalf of the Employee to pay to the Company) such amount of cash as the Company may be required, under all applicable federal, state, local or other laws or regulations, to withhold and pay over as income or other withholding taxes (the “Required Tax Payments”) with respect to the Award. If the Employee shall fail to advance the Required Tax Payments after request by the Company, the Company may, in its discretion, deduct any Required Tax Payments from any amount then or thereafter payable by the Company to the Employee. The Employee may elect to satisfy his or her obligation to advance the amount of any Required Tax Payments incurred in connection with the issuance and transfer of the Shares by any of the following means: (1) a cash payment to the Company, (2) delivery (either actual delivery or by attestation procedures established by the Company) to the Company of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the obligation to withhold or pay taxes arises in connection with an award (the “Tax Date”), equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, (3) with the consent of the Committee (other than for “officers” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or Directors, with respect to whom the consent of the Committee shall not be required), authorizing the Company to withhold whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the Tax Date, or withhold an amount of cash which would otherwise be payable to a holder, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such obligation, or (4) any combination of (1) and (2). Shares of Common Stock to be delivered or withheld may not have an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of the amount determined by applying the minimum statutory withholding rate. 

6.3. Compliance with Applicable Law. The Award is subject to the condition that if the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares subject to the Award upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the vesting of the restricted stock units or the delivery of the Shares hereunder, the Shares subject to the Award may not be delivered, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to effect or obtain any such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval.

The Company shall pay all original issue or transfer taxes and all fees and expenses incident to such delivery, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2. 

6.5. Award Confers No Rights to Continued Employment. In no event shall the granting of the Award or its acceptance by the Employee give or be deemed to give the Employee any right to continued employment by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company. 

6.6. Decisions of Board or Committee. The Board of Directors of the Company or the Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions which may arise in connection with the Award.

This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan (including the adjustment provision set forth in Section 12.4 thereof) and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. The Employee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan. This Award is intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as a “short-term deferral,” within the meaning of regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with such intent and in a manner that avoids the imposition of taxes and other penalties under Section 409A of the Code. The Company reserves the right to amend this Agreement to the extent it determines in its sole discretion such amendment is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, including but not limited to Section 409A of the Code.
