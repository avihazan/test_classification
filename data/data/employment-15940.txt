## 3.3 Notice of Termination.

# 5\. Restrictive Covenants.

## 5.1 Confidential Information.

The Executive agrees, without limitation in time or until such information shall become public other than by the Executive’s unauthorized disclosure (except as necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of his or her duties on behalf of the Company) or as required by any Legal Requirement (as defined below in Section 7.2) or legal process, to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and refrain from divulging, disclosing, or otherwise using in any respect the Confidential Information to the detriment of the Company and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns, or for any other purpose or no purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no prohibition against the Executive using the general skill and knowledge which he or she has acquired as an employee of the Company.

## 5.2 Ownership of Intellectual Property.

All Materials belong exclusively to the Company and its successors or assigns, with the Company and its successors or assigns having the right to obtain and to hold in its or their own name, copyrights, patents, trademarks, applications, registrations or such other protection as may be appropriate to the subject matter, and any extensions and renewals thereof.

## or enforce the rights defined in this Section. Executive shall communicate and deliver to the Company and its successors or assigns promptly and fully all Materials conceived or developed by him (alone or jointly with others) during the period of his employment relationship with the Company and its successors and assigns.

## 5.3 Covenant Not to Compete.

### (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason, then for a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the later of three (3) years after the Closing Date or two (2) years after the Date of Termination, Executive shall not in any city, town or county in any state of the United States where the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns engages in the Business (defined below) as of the date of such termination, directly or indirectly, do any of the following:

#### (i) engage in any business which is competitive with the business of the Company as conducted today, which is the distribution of orthopedic durable medical equipment (including orthotics and prosthetics) to patients (the “Business”), for the Executive’s own account;

###### (ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to or for, any entity that is engaged in the Business other than a separate division of such entity that is not engaged in the Business; or

###### (iii) become interested in any entity engaged in the Business in any capacity, including as an individual, partner, member, shareholder, officer, director, principal, employee, agent, investor, trustee or Executive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) for purposes of this paragraph (a), so long as Rainier Medical LLC is not engaged in the Business, it shall not be deemed a competitor of the Company and (ii) Executive may own, directly or indirectly, solely as a passive investment, securities of any entity if the Executive is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such entity and does not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own 5.0% or more of any class of securities of such entity.

### (b) Noninterference. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive without Good Reason, then for a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the later of three (3) years after the Closing Date or two (2) years after the Date of Termination, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, do

7

  


* * *

  


### any of the following: solicit, induce, or attempt to solicit or induce any person known by Executive to be a partner, principal, member, employee or Executive of the Company or its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns, to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns.

### (c) Nonsolicitation. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive without Good Reason, then for a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the later of three (3) years after the Closing Date or two (2) years after the date of final payment under the terms of this Agreement, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, or attempt to solicit or induce any person or entity then known to be a customer, client, vendor, supplier, distributor or Executive of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns to terminate his, her or its relationship with the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns for any purpose.

## 5.4 Return of Documents and Other Property. At the end of the Term or upon any earlier Date of Termination , the Executive shall return to the Company all of its property, equipment, documents, records, lists, files and any and all other Company materials (including, without limitation, computerized or electronic information) that is in Executive’s possession as of the Date of Termination (the “Company Property”). The Company Property shall be delivered to the Company at its office in Auburn, Washington (or at such other location mutually agreed by the Company and the Executive), at Company’s expense, within five (5) business days after the Date of Termination. Unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing, Executive shall not employ any Company Property.

## 5.5 Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants. The Executive agrees that, due to the uniqueness of his skills and abilities and the uniqueness of the Confidential Information that will be disclosed to him or her in the course of his or her employment with the Company, the covenants set forth herein are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company. Nevertheless, if it shall be determined that such covenants are unenforceable in that they are too broad as to their scope or geographical coverage, then the parties hereby confer upon any appropriate court the power to limit such scope or geographical coverage such that they will be enforceable.

## 5.6 Irreparable Injury. Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in this Section 5 and the Executive’s services under this Agreement are of a special and unique character, which gives them a special value to the Company, the loss of which may not be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages in an action at law, and that a material breach or threatened breach by him of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement

8

  


* * *

  


## will cause the Company irreparable injury. Executive therefore agrees that the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy, to seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions and any other appropriate equitable remedy that prevents Executive from breaching this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages or the posting of any bond or security, enjoining or restraining Executive from any such violation or threatened violation.

# 6\. Arbitration. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 5.6, any dispute between the parties arising out of this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute regarding any aspect of this Agreement, its formation, validity, interpretation, effect, performance or breach, or the Executive’s employment (“Arbitrable Dispute”) shall be submitted to arbitration in Seattle, Washington, before an experienced employment arbitrator who is either licensed to practice law in Washington or is a retired judge. The parties agree to make a good faith effort to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator. However, if the parties are unable to reach agreement on an arbitrator, one will be selected pursuant to the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American Arbitration Association or any successor rules thereto. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules or any successor rules. The arbitrator in any Arbitrable Dispute shall not have authority to modify or change this Agreement in any respect. The prevailing party in any such arbitration shall be awarded his or its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The Executive and the Company shall each be responsible for payment of one-half the amount of the arbitrator’s fee(s). The arbitrator’s decision and/or award will be fully enforceable and subject to an entry of judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction.
