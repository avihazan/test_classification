(Effective as of January 1, 2010)

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Executive is currently employed by the Company as Chief Operating Officer of the Company;

WHEREAS, Company and the Executive previously entered into an employment agreement defining the terms and conditions of Executive’s employment with the Company, dated as of October 16, 2006 (“Original Agreement”);

WHEREAS, the Original Agreement provided Executive with certain rights, responsibilities, and benefits;

WHEREAS, the Company and Executive believe that it is in the best interest of each to make certain changes to Executive’s terms and conditions of his employment with the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to obtain the services of Executive, and Executive desires to provide services to the Company, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and mutual agreements set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in reliance upon the representations, covenants and mutual agreements contained herein, the Company and Executive agree to amend and restate the Original Agreement as follows:

1. Employment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to employ Executive as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and Executive agrees to diligently perform the duties associated with such positions. Executive will report directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Executive will devote substantially all of his business time, attention and energies to the business of the Company and will comply with the charters, policies and guidelines established by the Company from time to time applicable to its senior management executives. Except as otherwise specifically listed on Schedule 1, during the term of his employment under this Agreement (as set forth in Section 2) Executive shall be prohibited from engaging in any personal land banking or lot or land development without the prior written consent of the Board.

* * *

  


2. Term. Executive will be employed under this Agreement until December 31, 2012, unless Executive’s employment is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 6. Thereafter, the Agreement will automatically renew for additional periods of one year (“Renewal Term(s)”), unless on or before August 31, 2012 (or August 31 of any Renewal Term), either Executive or the Company notifies the other in writing that it wishes to terminate employment under this Agreement at the end of the term then in effect.

3. Base Salary. The Company will pay Executive a base salary (“Base Salary”) at the annual rate of $500,000 per year. The Board may adjust Executive’s Base Salary from time to time, provided that the Base Salary may not be reduced without Executive’s consent. The Base Salary will be payable in accordance with the payroll practices of the Company in effect from time to time.

4. Incentive Compensation.

A. Bonus. Executive may, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board (“Committee”), be entitled to annual incentive compensation based on the achievement of certain goals and performance criteria established pursuant to the Company’s 2006 Executive Management Incentive Plan as specified in Exhibit A hereto (“Bonus”). The Committee has the complete discretion to act reasonably to reduce the amount of the annual incentive compensation established pursuant to Exhibit A (the “Actual Bonus”) and any such Actual Bonus, if any, will be due and payable in accordance with Exhibit A.

B. Long-Term Incentives. In February, 2009, the Committee granted to Executive 75,000 shares of restricted Company stock (“Restricted Shares”) under the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) which will vest ratably in 2010, 2011 and 2012 if certain conditions are satisfied. This Restricted Shares grant was designed to constitute equity award grants for 2009, 2010 and 2011; provided, however that the Committee will continue to review the Company’s operating results and may from time to time consider additional stock option and/or restricted stock grants. For years after 2011, the Committee shall grant Executive an option to purchase a minimum of 15,000 shares of Company stock or such equivalent number of shares subject to full value awards as the Committee determines in its discretion. The Restricted Shares grant and any options or other equity-based awards shall, upon termination of Executive’s employment under Section 6.B., C or E or the nonrenewal of this Agreement, be immediately accelerated and become fully vested without further action and all restrictions on such awards shall immediately lapse. Such restricted stock, options and other equity-based awards shall also be subject to the accelerated vesting and other provisions set forth in the Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement between Executive and Company, effective as of January 1, 2010 (“CIC Agreement”).

5. Executive Benefits. During the term of this Agreement, Executive will be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable and customary business expenses. The Company will provide to Executive a $1,200 per month automobile allowance, such fringe benefits and other Executive benefits as are regularly provided by the Company to its employees generally and senior management (e.g., health and life insurance, Paid Time Off, etc.); provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from amending or terminating any employee or

Upon a termination for Cause by the Company, the provisions of Section 7 (Restrictive Covenant) shall automatically become applicable for the six-month period set forth therein, without any further payment due Executive.

If Executive dies or becomes Disabled during any period that the Company is obliged to make payments under Section 6.B. or C, the Company shall make a lump sum payment to Executive (or his estate) of any unpaid amount within thirty (30) days of such death or Disability.

F. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

(1) “Cause” and “Good Reason” shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the CIC Agreement, provided, that Good Reason also exists under this Agreement if (A) the Company fails to cause any successor to immediately assume the terms of this Agreement, or (B) the Company materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement and such breach is not cured within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days after written notice from the Executive;

(2) “Date of Termination” shall mean (i) if this Agreement is terminated as a result of Executive’s death, the date of Executive’s death, (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Executive, the date on which he notifies the Company in 

4

* * *

  


writing (but following the Company’s opportunity to cure as provided in the CIC Agreement), (iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Disability, the date a notice of termination is given, (iv) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Cause, the date a final determination is provided to Executive by the Company (following the procedures set forth in the CIC Agreement), or (v) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company without Cause, the date notice of termination is given to Executive by the Company;

(3) “Disability” shall mean if, by reason of any medically determinable physical or metal impairment which actually impairs Executive’s ability to perform his job and which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, Executive is receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than six months under an accident and health plan established by the Company for its employees; and

(4) “Separation from Service” means, either (a) termination of Executive’s employment with Company and all Affiliates, or (b) a permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services Executive provides to Company and all Affiliates to an amount that is 20% or less of the average level of bona fide services Executive provided to Company in the immediately preceding 36 months, with the level of bona fide service calculated in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii). Solely for purposes of determining whether Executive has a “Separation from Service,” Executive’s employment relationship is treated as continuing while Executive is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence (if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as Executive’s right to reemployment with Company or an Affiliate is provided either by statute or contract). If Executive’s period of leave exceeds six months and Executive’s right to reemployment is not provided either by statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first day immediately following the expiration of such six-month period. Whether a termination of employment has occurred will be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances and in accordance with regulations issued by the United States Treasury Department pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

G. Procedures for Notices of Termination. The procedures set forth in Section 8(a), (b) and (d) of the CIC Agreement shall apply under this Agreement in connection with a notice of termination as to the kind of termination events described in those subsections.

H. Release Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no payment shall be made under this Section 6 unless Executive executes (and does not revoke) a legal release (“Release Agreement”), in the form and substance reasonably requested by the Company, in which Executive releases the Company, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and others affiliated with the Company from any and all claims, including claims relating to Executive’s employment with the Company and the termination of Executive’s employment. The Release Agreement shall be provided to Executive within 5 days following Executive’s termination of employment (or “Separation from Service” if Executive is a “Specified Employee”). The Release Agreement must be executed and returned to the Company within the 

5

* * *

  


21 or 45 day (as applicable) period described in the Release Agreement and it must not be revoked by Executive within the 7-day revocation period described in the Release Agreement.

I. Compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Any payment under this Section 6 shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.I. (except for a payment pursuant to Section 6.E.). If Executive is a “Specified Employee” of the Company for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Code Section 409A”) at the time of a payment event set forth in Sections 6.B. or C, and if no exception from Section 409A applies in whole or in part, then the severance payments pursuant to Section 6.C.(v) shall be made to Executive by the Company on the first day of the seventh month following the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (the “409A Payment Date”). Should this Section 6.I. result in a delay of payments to Executive, the Company shall begin to make such payments as described in this Section 6, provided that any amounts that would have been payable earlier but for the application of this Section 6.I., shall be paid in lump-sum on the 409A Payment Date along with accrued interest at the rate of interest announced by Bank of America, Arizona from time to time at its prime rate from the date that payments to you should have been made under this Agreement. The balance of such severance payments shall be payable in accordance with regular payroll timing and the COBRA premiums shall be reimbursed monthly. For purposes of this provision, the term Specified Employee shall have the meaning set forth in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or any successor provision and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder.

7. Restrictive Covenant.

A. Executive hereby covenants and agrees that for a period of two years from the Date of Termination, Executive will not:

(1) Directly or indirectly hire or solicit for employment for any other business entity other than the Company (whether as an employee, consultant, independent contractor, or otherwise) any person who is, or within the six-month period preceding the date of such activity was, an employee, independent contractor or the like of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, unless Company gives its written consent to such employment or offer of employment.

(2) Call on or directly or indirectly solicit or divert or take away from Company or any of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, by divulging to any competitor or potential competitor or company or its subsidiaries) any person, firm, corporation, or other entity who was a customer or prospective customer of the Company during Executive’s term of employment.

B. The covenants set forth in this Section 7 shall begin as of the date hereof and will survive the Executive’s termination of employment under Section 6.

8. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information.

A. It is understood that in the course of Executive’s employment with Company, Executive will become acquainted with Company Confidential Information (as defined below). Executive recognizes that Company Confidential Information has been 

6

* * *

  


developed or acquired at great expense, is proprietary to the Company, and is and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company. Accordingly, Executive agrees that he will not, disclose to others, copy, make any use of, or remove from Company’s premises any Company Confidential Information, except as Executive’s duties may specifically require, without the express written consent of the Company, during Executive’s employment with the Company and thereafter until such time as Company Confidential Information becomes generally known, or readily ascertainable by proper means by persons unrelated to the Company.

B. Upon any termination of employment, Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company the originals and all copies of any and all materials, documents, notes, manuals, or lists containing or embodying Company Confidential Information, or relating directly or indirectly to the business of the Company, in the possession or control of Executive.

C. Executive hereby agrees that the period of time provided for in this Section 8 and other provisions and restrictions set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company and its successors and assigns in the use and employment of the goodwill of the business conducted by Executive. Executive further agrees that damages cannot compensate the Company in the event of a violation of this Section 8 and that, if such violation should occur, injunctive relief shall be essential for the protection of the Company and its successors and assigns. Accordingly, Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, in the event any of the provisions of this Section 8 shall be violated or breached, the Company shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the party or parties violating such covenants, without bond but upon due notice, in addition to such further or other relief as may be available at equity or law. Obtainment of such an injunction by the Company shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right to assert any other remedies which the Company has at law or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from forbearance or failure by the Company to take action thereof. The prevailing party in any litigation, arbitration or similar dispute resolution proceeding to enforce this provision will recover any and all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.

D. “Company Confidential Information” shall mean confidential, proprietary information or trade secrets of Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates including without limitation the following: (1) customer lists and customer information as compiled by Company; (2) Company’s internal practices and procedures; (3) Company’s financial condition and financial results of operation; (4) supply of materials information, including sources and costs, designs, information on land and lot inventories, and current and prospective projects; (5) strategic planning, manufacturing, engineering, purchasing, finance, marketing, promotion, distribution, and selling activities; (6) all other information which Executive has a reasonable basis to consider confidential or which is treated by Company as confidential; and (7) all information having independent economic value to Company that is not generally known to, and not readily ascertainable by proper means by, persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the following shall not be considered “Company Confidential Information”: (i) the general skills of the Executive as an experienced real estate and homebuilding senior management level employee; (ii) information generally known by senior management executives within the homebuilding and/or land development industry; (iii) persons, entities, contacts or relationships of Executive that are also generally known in the industry; and (iv) information which becomes available on a non-

7

* * *

  


confidential basis from a source other than Executive which source is not prohibited from disclosing such confidential information by legal, contractual or other obligation.

9. Cooperation; No Disparagement. During the one-year period following the Executive’s Date of Termination, Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the Company (including assistance with litigation matters), upon the Company’s request, concerning the Executive’s previous employment responsibilities and functions with the Company. Additionally, at all times after the Executive’s employment with the Company has terminated, Company and Executive agree to refrain from making any disparaging or derogatory remarks, statements and/or publications regarding the other, its employees or its services. In consideration for such cooperation, Company shall compensate Executive for the time Executive spends on such cooperative efforts (at an hourly rate based on Executive’s total compensation during the year preceding the Date of Termination) and Company shall reimburse Executive for his reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Executive incurs in connection with such cooperative efforts.

10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any applicable law, then such provision will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification will make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.

11. Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon such consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the term “Company” as used herein shall mean such other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Failure of Company to obtain assumption of this Agreement by a successor upon a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement.

12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the CIC Agreement, and any agreements concerning stock options, restricted stock or other benefits, embody the complete agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior written, or prior or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by the Company and Executive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to affect any previous agreements pertaining to the grant of options to the Executive prior to the Effective Date, including without limitation, provisions in Executive’s prior Change of Control Agreement, providing for acceleration upon a change of control.

13. Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Arizona.

EXHIBIT A

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION SCHEDULE

STEVEN DAVIS Bonus Compensation

# Part I — Bonus

2010 and any Renewal Term

For 2010 (and any Renewal Term), Executive may, in the Board’s reasonable discretion, be entitled to a maximum bonus equal to .325% of the EBITDA (excluding impairments, one-time bond, refinancing, offering, significant litigation, settlement payments, by the Company and similar costs associated with one-time or extraordinary events) if Company’s ROA is in the top 1/2 of public homebuilders having revenues of $500 million or more per year, and an additional .325% of EBITDA if the Company’s ROE is in the top 1/2 of these public homebuilders. If either measurement falls within the 33% to 49% percentile, the bonus shall be .21% of EBITDA for the applicable measurement. If either measurement falls below the 33% threshold, then there will not be any formula bonus paid with respect to such measurement. Such bonus calculation will be determined before taking into account the deduction for the compensation of (i) the Executive; (ii) the Chief Executive Officer; (iii) the Chief Financial Officer and (iv) the General Counsel. Notwithstanding the above, the above calculation of EBITDA assumes that the Company makes an actual profit before calculating EBITDA. If the Company does not make an actual profit before calculating EBITDA, no bonus will be paid.  
  
# Part II — Payment

# 

Any bonus shall be paid in the form and time as determined by the Board in its reasonable discretion, provided that the bonus shall be paid in cash no later than the later of (i) March 15 of the year following the calendar year to which the payment relates, or (ii) the date that is two and one-half months following the end of the Company’s fiscal year to which the payment relates.

In addition, the Board at its discretion may award a subjective bonus to Executive.
