NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree that as of the Grant Date, the Corporation hereby grants Optionee an option to purchase from it, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Corporation’s 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”), a copy of which is attached hereto, that number of shares of the authorized and unissued Common Stock of the Corporation as is set forth on Schedule A hereto.

## (a) This option shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option which is not intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

## 

## (b) The per share exercise price for the shares subject to this option shall be the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Common Stock on the Grant Date, which exercise price is set forth on Schedule A hereto;

# 2. Payment of Exercise Price. The option may be exercised, in part or in whole, only by written request to the Corporation accompanied by payment of the exercise price in full either: (i) in cash for the shares with respect to which it is exercised; (ii) if the shares underlying the option are registered under the Securities Act, by delivering to the Corporation a notice of exercise with an irrevocable direction to a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to sell a sufficient portion of the shares and deliver the sale proceeds directly to the Corporation to pay the exercise price; or (iii) by delivering previously owned shares of Common Stock or a combination of shares and cash having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) equal to the exercise price of the shares being purchased; provided, however, that shares of Common Stock delivered by the Optionee may be accepted as full or partial payment of the exercise price for any exercise of the option hereunder only if the shares have been held by the Optionee for at least six (6) months.

# 

# 3. Miscellaneous.

# 

## (a) This Agreement is binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.

## 

## (b) This Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, and may be executed in more than one counterpart, each of which shall constitute an original document.
