(ii) be signed by the person or persons entitled to exercise the Option and, if the Option is being exercised by any person or persons other than the Grantee, be accompanied by proof, satisfactory to the Committee, of the rights of such person or persons to exercise the Option. 

4\. Term of Option. Without limitation, the unexercised portion of this Option shall automatically terminate on the date this Option terminates in accordance with the terms of the Plan, including, without limitation, Section 7.3 of the Plan; provided, further, and without extending or otherwise affecting the termination date of this Option, Grantee is advised that if this Option is exercised after the earlier of (i) 90 days from the date of termination of Service, unless Grantee’s Service is terminated by reason of death or Disability, or Grantee dies within 90 days from the date of termination of Service; (ii) the second anniversary of Grantee’s termination of Service if either (x) Grantee’s termination of Service is by reason of his death, or (y) Grantee dies within 90 days of his termination of Service; and (iii) the first anniversary of his termination of Service by reason of Disability, then this Option will not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, and upon exercise, in addition to the payments described in Section 5, the Grantee must pay the applicable withholding as provided under the Plan with respect to nonqualified Options. 

5\. Payment. The Option Price of any Vested Option Shares purchased shall be paid in (i) cash, (ii) shares of Stock, or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Stock; provided, further, that if the Option Shares are publicly traded on the date the Option is exercised, the Committee may require that all or any portion of the Option Price be paid in cash. 

6\. Issuance of Option Shares.

7\. Surrender of Option. Upon exercise of the Option in part, if requested by the Committee, the Grantee shall deliver this Award Agreement and other written agreements executed by the Company and the Grantee with respect to the Option to a duly authorized officer of the Company who shall endorse or cause to be endorsed thereon a notation of such exercise and return such agreements to the Grantee. 

8\. Forfeiture, Repurchase Rights and Parachute Limitations. Without limiting the generality of the general incorporation of the Plan provisions, this Award Agreement expressly incorporates by reference the provisions of Section 12 (Restrictions on the Transfer Of Shares Of Stock and Repurchase Rights) and Section 13 (Parachute Limitations and Forfeitures). 

9\. Other Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, all Option Shares shall be subject to any other agreements between the Grantee and the Company (collectively, “Other Agreements”) in effect at the time of reference; and provided further that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall

* * *

have the power and ability to exercise some or all of its rights under either this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Plan incorporated by reference), or the Other Agreements, or both, with respect to some or all of the Option Shares. 

10\. Law Governing. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS AWARD AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. 

11\. Repurchase Rights of the Company; Fair Market Value Determination. If Grantee’s Service is terminated by reason of a Voluntary Termination or for Cause, then, in its sole discretion, the Company may purchase all or any portion of the Option Shares which have been exercised by Grantee prior to or in connection with such termination of Grantee’s Service. The Fair Market Value of such Vested Option Shares shall be, for purpose of this Section, determined by the Board in its sole discretion as of the effective date of Grantee’s termination of Service. If Grantee disagrees with the Board’s determination of the Fair Market Value (the “Board Determination”), then Grantee shall notify the Board in writing (the “Dispute Notification”) that Grantee wishes to dispute the determination. If the dispute is not resolved between the Board and Grantee within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Dispute Notification, then the Board shall appoint a third-party expert in valuing companies that are comparable to the Company to conduct a determination of the Fair Market Value (the “Third Party Determination”). The Third Party Determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Board and Grantee. If the Third Party Determination is within ten percent (10%) of the Board Determination, then Grantee shall bear the costs incurred in obtaining the Third Party Determination. If the Third Party Determination differs from the Board Determination by ten percent (10%) or more, then the Company shall bear such costs. 

12\. Change of Control. The “Change of Control” definition of the Plan shall apply to the Option, except that the following provisions will be substituted in the place of existing Section 2.9(ii) and Section 2.9(iii) of the Plan: 

“(ii) a change in the effective control of the Company, whereby either: 

(a) a Person acquires (or has acquired during the preceding twelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person), directly or indirectly, ownership of a number of shares of Capital Stock of the Company which constitutes fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Capital Stock; provided, however, that if a Person already owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Capital Stock, the acquisition of additional Capital Stock by such Person is not considered a Change of Control of the Company; or 

(b) as a result of, or in connection with any tender offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any combination of the foregoing transactions, a majority of the persons who were members of the Board is, within a twelve (12) month period, replaced by individuals whose appointment or election to the Board is not endorsed by a majority of the Board prior to the appointment or election; or 

3 

* * *

(iii) a change in the ownership of the assets of the Company, whereby a Person acquires (or has acquired during a twelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person) assets of the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to more than fifty percent (50%) of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company as determined by the Board immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions; provided, however, that there is no Change of Control if assets are transferred to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the Company immediately after the transfer, nor is it a Change of Control if the Company transfers assets to: 

(a) a shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to the shareholder’s capital stock in the Company; 

(b) an entity, fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company; 

(c) a Person that owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding Capital Stock; or 

(d) an entity, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a Person described in subparagraph (iii)(c) of this Section 2.9.” 

13\. Incentive Stock Options. The Option is issued under the Plan and is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and will be interpreted accordingly. To the extent that all or any portion of this Option is determined by the Committee not to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option for any reason, such portion of this Option shall be deemed a Nonqualified Stock Option for all purposes. 

14\. At-Will Employment. Nothing in this Award Agreement shall be implied or construed to create a contract for employment. Unless expressly provided for in a separate written agreement executed by Grantee and a duly authorized representative of the Company on behalf of the Company, if Grantee is an employee of the Company, Grantee’s employment is terminable “at-will.”
