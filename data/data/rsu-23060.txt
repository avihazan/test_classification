(b) Beneficiary Designation: You may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive or exercise any vested Award that is unpaid or unexercised at your death by completing a Beneficiary Designation Form.

However, as described in Section 6(b), you may complete a Beneficiary Designation Form to name the person who may receive any Restricted Stock that is settled after you die. Also, with the Board’s consent, you may be allowed to transfer your Restricted Stock to certain Permissible Transferees (as defined in the Plan).
