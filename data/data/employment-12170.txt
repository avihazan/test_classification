In light of the highly competitive nature of the industry in which the Company’s business is conducted, the Employee agrees that all Proprietary Information, heretofore or in the future obtained by the Employee as a result of the Employee’s association with the Company shall be considered confidential.

  


In recognition of this fact, the Employee agrees that the Employee will not use or disclose any of such Proprietary Information for the Employee’s own purposes or for the benefit of any person or other entity or organization (except the Company) under any circumstances unless such Proprietary Information has been publicly disclosed generally or, unless upon written advice of legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Employee is legally required to disclose such Proprietary Information. Documents (as hereinafter defined) prepared by the Employee or that come into the Employee’s possession during the Employee’s association with the Company are and remain the property of the Company, and when this Agreement terminates, such Documents shall be returned to the Company at the Company’s principal place of business, as provided in the Notice provision (Section 11) of this Agreement.

g. Business Activities. “Business Activities” shall be deemed to include the Business, and any additional activities which the Company or any of its affiliates may engage in during the 12 months prior to the termination of Employee=s employment.

  


h. Covenants as Essential Elements of this Agreement. It is understood by and between the parties hereto that the foregoing covenants contained in Sections 7a and b are essential elements of this Agreement, and that but for the agreement by the Employee to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement. Such covenants by the Employee shall be construed to be agreements independent of any other provisions of this Agreement. The existence of any other claim or cause of action, whether predicated on any other provision in this Agreement, or otherwise, as a result of the relationship between the parties shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against the Employee.

i. Survival after Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the covenants in Sections 7a and b shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Employee’s employment with the Company.

j. Remedies.

  


(1) The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 7a or b herein would be inadequate and the breach shall be per se deemed as causing irreparable harm to the Company. In recognition of this fact, in the event of a breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of Section 7a or b, the Employee agrees that, in addition to any remedy at law available to the Company including, but not limited to monetary damages, all rights of the Employee to payment or otherwise under this Agreement and all amounts then or thereafter due to the Employee from the Company under this Agreement may be terminated and the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain, and the Employee agrees not to oppose the Company’s request for equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available to the Company.

  


(2) The Employee acknowledges that the granting of a temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or permanent injunction merely prohibiting the use of Proprietary Information would not be an adequate remedy upon breach or threatened breach of Section 7a or b and consequently agrees, upon proof of any such breach, to the granting of injunctive relief prohibiting any form of competition with the Company. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach.
