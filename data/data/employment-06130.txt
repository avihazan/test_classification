(a) For Cause. The Company may terminate this Agreement as of the Date of Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to Employee a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Employee and an opportunity for Employee, together with Employee's counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board that Employee was guilty of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in reasonable detail, provided, however, that if at such time Employee is a member of the Board of Directors, he shall abstain from voting with respect to any matter relating to termination of his employment. Upon termination for Cause, the Company shall pay to Employee all accrued and unpaid compensation for the period ending on the Date of Termination (including payment for any accrued and unused vacation time and the Annual Bonus accrued through the Date of Termination), and shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to Employee hereunder.

  


(b) Other than Cause or Disability. Employee's employment is at will and the Company may terminate this Agreement and Employee's employment for any reason deemed sufficient by the Company, including by reason of Employee's Disability, upon delivery of a Notice of Termination (or as of such date as is specified therein). However, in the event that Employee's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or by reason of his Disability, then in addition to paying to Employee all accrued and unpaid wages due to Employee for periods ended on or prior to the effective date of the termination (including payment for any accrued and unused vacation time and the Annual Bonus accrued through the Date of Termination), the Company shall pay to Employee (i) the Base Compensation that Employee would have earned during the remainder of Term of this Agreement, and (ii) if such termination occurs after the first date as of which Employee has been employed hereunder for at least sixteen (16) consecutive calendar months, then the Company also shall pay to Employee the additional sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

5.4 Conditional Nature of Severance Payments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary:

  


(a) Noncompete. Employee acknowledges that the nature of the Company's business is such that if Employee were to become employed by, or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company during the period of one (1) year following the termination of Employee's employment with the Company, then it would be very difficult for Employee not to rely on or use the Company's trade secrets and confidential information in connection with that employment.

  


(i) Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company's trade secrets and confidential information, Employee acknowledges and agrees that his right to receive the severance consideration described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, above (to the extent Employee is otherwise entitled to such payments thereunder) shall be conditioned upon Employee not directly or indirectly engaging in (whether as an employee, consultant, agent, proprietor, principal, partner, stockholder, corporate officer, director or otherwise), or having any ownership interest in or participating in the financing, operation, management or control of, any person, firm, corporation or business that directly competes with Company or is a customer of the Company and has operations located within a radius of five (5) miles from any lease owned or operated by the Company. If Employee engages, invests, or otherwise participates in any competitive activity described in this Section 5.4(a), then all severance payments consideration to which Employee otherwise may be entitled under Section 5.2 and 5.3 above, as applicable, thereupon shall cease.

  


(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not be deemed to be in violation of the foregoing restriction solely by reason of Employee's owning not more than one percent (1.0%) of the equity securities of any corporation or other business enterprise, the equity securities of which are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.

  


(b) Non-Solicitation. Until the date one (1) year after the termination of Employee's employment with the Company for any reason, Employee agrees and acknowledges that Employee's right to receive the severance consideration described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 (to the extent Employee is otherwise entitled to such payments thereunder) shall be conditioned upon Employee not either directly or indirectly soliciting, attempting to hire, recruiting, encouraging, taking away, hiring any employee of the Company or inducing or otherwise causing an employee to leave his or her employment with the Company (regardless whether to commence employment with Employee or with any other entity or person). If Employee engages in any such activity, then all severance consideration to which Employee otherwise would be entitled under Sections 5.2 or 5.3, above, as applicable, thereupon shall cease.

  


(c) General Release. Employee shall not be entitled to receive any of the severance consideration described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 above, unless Employee executes and delivers to the Company, within fifteen (15) days of the Date of Termination, a release in the form attached hereto as Appendix 2.

  


(d) Resignation from Board. Employee shall not be entitled to receive any of the severance consideration described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 above, unless Employee resigns from the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 5.8, below. If the Company requests such resignation until after payment of severance consideration has commenced hereunder, then the Company shall be excused from any further obligation to pay such severance consideration if Employee thereafter fails to resign from the Board of Directors in accordance with such Section 5.8.

  


5.5 Death. This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the death of Employee. If Employee's employment is terminated by reason of Employee's death, then the Company shall pay to Employee's beneficiaries or legal representatives (i) within 15 days, all accrued and unpaid Base Compensation and vacation pay for all periods ended on or before the date of Employee's death, and (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to make any further payments hereunder.

  


* * *

  


5.6 Mitigation. Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 5 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as a result of employment by another employer, self employment earnings, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owing by Employee to the Company, or otherwise. No amounts payable to Employee under any plan or program of the Company shall reduce or offset any amounts payable to Employee under this Agreement.

  


5.7 Deferral in Commencement Per IRC Â§409A. The parties intend that any amounts payable hereunder that could constitute "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 409A") shall comply with Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner that does not result in the imposition of additional taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A. The Company and Employee agree to negotiate in good faith to make amendments to the Agreement, as the parties mutually agree are necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect, and Employee shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed on or for the account of Employee in connection with the Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, (including any taxes, penalties and interest under Section 409A), and none of the Company Group shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold Employee (or any beneficiary) harmless from any or all of such taxes, penalties or interest.

  


(a) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Employee is deemed to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code and Employee is not "disabled" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, no payments in this Agreement that are "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A shall be made to Employee prior to the date that is six months after the date of Employee's "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A) or, if earlier, Employee's date of death. Following any applicable six month delay, all such delayed payments shall be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permissible under Section 409A that is also a business day.

  


(b) For purposes of Section 409A, each of the payments that may be made under this Agreement shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. Amounts payable under this Agreement shall be deemed not to be a "deferral of compensation" subject to Section 409A to the extent provided in the exceptions in Treasury Regulation Â§Â§ 1.409A-1(b)(4) ("short-term deferrals") and (b)(9) ("separation pay plans," including the exceptions under subparagraph (iii) and subparagraph (v)(D)) and other applicable provisions of Treasury Regulation Â§Â§ 1.409A-1 through A-6.

  


(c) With respect to the time of payments of any amounts under the Agreement that are "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A, references in the Agreement to "termination of employment" (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A.

  


(d) For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that any indemnification payment to Employee or expense reimbursement made hereunder shall be exempt from Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any indemnification payment or expense reimbursement made hereunder shall be determined to be "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A, then (i) the amount of the indemnification payment or expense reimbursement during one taxable year shall not affect the amount of the indemnification payments or expense reimbursement during any other taxable year, (ii) the indemnification payments or expense reimbursement shall be made on or before the last day of Employee's taxable year following the year in which the expense was incurred, and (iii) the right to indemnification payments or expense reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. In addition, any reimbursements for COBRA coverage premiums described in this Agreement shall be paid to Employee as promptly as practicable, and in all events on or before the last day of the third taxable year of Employee following the taxable year of the Company in which Employee's employment terminated.

  


* * *

  


5.8 Resignation from Board Following Termination. Employee covenants and agrees that (a) at any time following the termination of Employee's employment with the Company for any reason, the Company may request that Employee resign from the Board of Directors, and (b) within two (2) business days following Employee's receipt of the Company's written request that Employee resign from the Board of Directors of the Company, Employee shall tender to the Company an immediately effective written resignation from the Company's Board of Directors.

  


6\. Miscellaneous
