6\. No Rights of Shareholders. 

Except as provided in Section 4 of the Agreement, neither the Grantee nor any personal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Corporation with respect to all or any portion of the Granted Shares as to which the restrictions under the Agreement have not lapsed prior to the date the restrictions lapse with respect to such Granted Shares under Section 3 of the Agreement.

8\. Employment Not Affected. 

Neither the grant of the Granted Shares nor the lapse of the restrictions thereon shall be construed as granting to the Grantee any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Except as may otherwise be limited by a written agreement between the Corporation or any subsidiary and the Grantee, the right of the Corporation or any parent or subsidiary to terminate at will the Grantee’s employment with it at any time (whether by dismissal, discharge, or otherwise) is specifically reserved and such right is acknowledged by the Grantee. 

9\. Withholding of Tax. 

As a condition of this Grant, and as a condition of delivery of the Granted Shares, when the Granted Shares become taxable to the Grantee, the Corporation shall have the right to require that the Grantee (or other person to whom the Granted Shares are to be delivered) remit to the Grantee’s employer or, in appropriate cases, agree to remit to such employer when due, an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state and local withholding tax requirements relating to this Grant. When Granted Shares become taxable to the Grantee, the Committee may permit the Grantee to elect to satisfy the Corporation’s tax withholding obligation with respect to the Granted Shares by having shares withheld up to an amount that does not exceed the Grantee’s minimum applicable withholding tax rate for federal (including FICA), state and local tax liabilities.

10\. Amendment of Grant. 

The Restricted Stock Grant may be amended by the Committee at any time (i) if it determines, in its sole discretion, that amendment is necessary or advisable in the light of any addition to or change in the Code or regulations issued thereunder, or any federal or state securities law or other law or regulation, which change occurs after the Restricted Stock Grant and by its terms retroactively applies to such Grant and (ii) with the consent of the Grantee. Any such amendment shall be in writing and signed by the Corporation and the Grantee. 

11\. Notice. 

Any notice to the Corporation provided for in this instrument shall be addressed to it in care of its Secretary, and any notice to the Grantee shall be addressed to the Grantee at the current address shown on the payroll of the Corporation or any subsidiary.

12\. Incorporation of Plan by Reference. 

This Restricted Stock Grant is made pursuant to the terms of the Plan. The terms of the Plan as in effect on the date hereof and as the Plan may be amended from time to time are incorporated herein by reference, and the Agreement shall in all respects be interpreted in accordance therewith. The Committee shall interpret and construe the Restricted Stock Grant, and its decision shall be conclusive and binding upon any questions arising hereunder. 

13\. Governing Law. 

The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this instrument shall exclusively be governed by and determined in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

(a) In consideration for the Restricted Stock Grant made to Grantee under the terms of this Agreement, Grantee agrees that during the term of Grantee’s employment with the Corporation or one or more of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (“Employer”) and for a twelve (12) month period beginning on the date that Grantee’s employment with Employer ceases for any reason (the “Termination Date”), Grantee shall not directly or indirectly, (i) accept employment with, (ii) own, manage, operate, join, control, solicit, finance, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, acquisition, control or financing of, (iii) be connected as a partner, principal, agent, representative, consultant or otherwise with, or (iv) use or permit Grantee’s name to be used in connection with, any business or enterprise engaged directly or indirectly in any business or enterprise engaged in a geographic area within 50 miles of any location from which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is operating on the Termination Date (the “Geographic Area”), in any business that is competitive to a business from which the Corporation and any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole from all geographic area, derived at least ten percent of its respective annual gross revenues for the twelve (12) months preceding the Termination Date.

(b) In consideration for the Restricted Stock Grant made to Grantee under the terms of this Agreement, Grantee agrees that during a twelve (12) month period beginning on the date that Grantee’s employment with Employer ceases for any reason, Grantee shall not

(ii). directly or indirectly solicit, recruit or hire any employee (full-time or part-time) of Employer to work for a third party other than Employer. 

(c) Grantee acknowledges, agrees and represents that the type and periods of restrictions imposed in this Agreement are fair and reasonable, and that such restrictions are intended solely to protect the legitimate interests of Employer, rather than to prevent Grantee from earning a livelihood.

Grantee further represent that: (i) Grantee is familiar with the covenants not to compete and not to solicit set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Grantee is fully aware of his or her obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of these covenants, (iii) Grantee find the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of these covenants to be reasonable, and (iv) Grantee is receiving valuable and sufficient consideration for Grantee’s covenants not to compete and not to solicit.

(b) In consideration for the Restricted Stock Grant made to Grantee under the terms of this Agreement, Grantee agrees that during a twelve (12) month period beginning on the date that Grantee’s employment with Employer ceases for any reason, Grantee shall not 

(i). directly or indirectly solicit, entice, broker or induce an agreement with any person or entity that had a contractual agreement with Employer during the term of Grantee’s employment to enter into an agreement or arrangement with Grantee or any third party that would preclude the person or entity, either contractually or practically, from working with Employer; or 

(ii). directly or indirectly solicit, recruit or hire any employee (full-time or part-time) of Employer to work for a third party other than Employer. 

(c) Grantee acknowledges, agrees and represents that the type and periods of restrictions imposed in this Agreement are fair and reasonable, and that such restrictions are intended solely to protect the legitimate interests of Employer, rather than to prevent Grantee from earning a livelihood. Grantee recognizes that Employer competes or may compete in the Restricted Territory and that Grantee’s access to confidential information makes it necessary for Employer to restrict Grantee’s post-employment activities in the Restricted Territory. Grantee further represent that: (i) Grantee is familiar with the covenants not to compete and not to solicit set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Grantee is fully aware of his or her obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of these covenants, (iii) Grantee find the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of these covenants to be reasonable, and (iv) Grantee is receiving valuable and sufficient consideration for Grantee’s covenants not to compete and not to solicit.
