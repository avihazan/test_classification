12\. Payments to Key Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within the meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after such termination of employment; provided, however, that to the extent such six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of Control as defined in Section 9.1, the payment shall be paid into a rabbi trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not imposed with such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as permissible under Section 409A. 

13\. Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe Harbor). In the event a payment is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not be subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2) times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive’s annualized compensation based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination of employment occurs or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Executive terminates service (the “Safe Harbor Amount”). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor Amount, only the amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In addition, if such Executive is considered a key employee, such payment in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be subject to the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided in Section 12 of this Agreement. The Executive and the Employer agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 13 are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service.
