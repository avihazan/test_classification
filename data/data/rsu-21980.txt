Exhibit 10.1



  


This agreement is entered into this _____ day of _____________ 2013 (the “Date of Grant”), and evidences the grant by The Management Network Group, Inc. (the “Company”) of Restricted Stock to __________________________________ (the “Grantee”).

1\. Shares Awarded and Restrictions on Shares. Pursuant to the terms of The Management Network Group, Inc. 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the Grantee is hereby awarded ___________ shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Restricted Shares”), subject to forfeiture and restriction on rights of sale and transfer as set forth herein.

2\. Sale or Transfer Restrictions; Vesting Conditions. The Restricted Shares awarded to the Grantee shall be held without the right of sale or transfer, and subject to forfeiture as provided in paragraph 4, until such restrictions lapse in accordance with the following performance and time based vesting schedule:

(a) Initial Vesting Date: On the Earnings Release Date for the Company's 2014 first fiscal quarter (the "Initial Vesting Date"), the percentage of the Restricted Shares vesting shall be equal to the percentage obtained by dividing (i) the Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA (as defined below) through the end of Company's 2014 first fiscal quarter, by (ii) $14 million.

(b) Subsequent Quarterly Vesting Dates. On each Earnings Release Date beginning with the Earnings Release Date for the Company's 2014 second fiscal quarter and ending on the Earnings Release Date for Company's 2017 first fiscal quarter (each a "Subsequent Vesting Date"), the percentage of the Restricted Shares vesting on such Earnings Release Date shall be equal to:

i. The percentage obtained by dividing (A) the Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA through the end of the fiscal quarter for which such Earnings Release Date relates, by (B) $14 million; minus,

ii. The cumulative percentage of Restricted Shares that have already vested on the Initial Vesting Date and all prior Subsequent Vesting Dates, if any.

In no event can more than 100% of the Restricted Shares become vested.

(c) Change of Control Vesting. Notwithstanding the vesting conditions set forth above in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) above, if a Change of Control occurs before the end of the Performance Period, then the vesting requirements set forth above in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) above shall no longer apply with respect to any Subsequent Vesting Date after the consummation of the Change of Control and all Restricted Shares which have not otherwise vested at the time of the Change of Control shall vest as follows:

* * *

i. Immediately prior to the consummation of the Change of Control, a number of Restricted Shares equal to the lesser of (1) the aggregate number of Restricted Shares that vested in accordance with paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) above before the Change of Control, or (2) the total number of unvested Restricted Shares remaining under this agreement at the time of the Change of Control, shall vest and cease to be subject to any of the restrictions of this agreement; and

ii. After the Change of Control, subject to the Grantee's continued employment and to all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, any unvested Restricted Shares remaining after the accelerated vesting pursuant to subparagraph 2(c)(i) above shall vest in five (5) increments over the immediately following five (5) anniversary dates of the date of the Change of Control. The number of Restricted Shares eligible to become vested on such five anniversaries shall be one-fifth of that number of Restricted Shares that remain subject to the transferability and forfeiture restrictions of this paragraph 2 as of the date of the Change of Control.

3\. Accelerated Removal of Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the sale and transfer restrictions on the Restricted Shares shall immediately lapse, to the extent such restrictions have not already lapsed pursuant to paragraph 2, upon the earlier of the following:

(a) The Grantee’s involuntary termination of employment without Cause following a Change of Control of the Company; or

(b) The Grantee’s voluntary termination of employment for Good Reason following a Change of Control of the Company.

4\. Employment Requirement and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock. In the event the Grantee’s employment with the Company terminates prior to the date on which the restrictions shall lapse, as specified in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Restricted Shares will be forfeited by the Grantee and become the property of the Company. For purposes of this agreement, an authorized leave of absence (authorized by the Company to the Grantee in writing) shall not be deemed a termination of employment hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except where a Change of Control has occurred before the last day of the Performance Period, all unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited on the last day of the Performance Period.

5\. Issuance of Restricted Shares. Restricted Shares will be issued in book entry form with the Grantee being named the beneficial owner. When the prohibited sale and transfer restrictions lapse under paragraph 2 or 3 with respect to the Restricted Shares, provided the Restricted Shares have not been forfeited under paragraph 4, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Grantee a stock certificate for the Shares represented by the Restricted Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company requires reimbursement of any tax required by law to be withheld with respect to the delivery of Shares pursuant to this agreement, the Company shall not deliver such Shares until the required payment is made.

6\. Voting and Other Rights of Restricted Shares. Upon the issuance of the Restricted Shares, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to receive dividends and to vote the Restricted Shares until such shares may have been forfeited to the Company as provided in paragraph 4; provided, however, any such dividends that are paid in cash shall be held in escrow by the Company and, such any dividends (whether in cash or other property) shall be subject to the same rights, restrictions on transfer and conditions regarding vesting and forfeiture as the Restricted Shares. In the event of forfeiture by the Grantee of any or all of the Restricted Shares, the Grantee shall also forfeit all cash dividends held in escrow and any other dividends received relating to the underlying forfeited Restricted Shares and all such forfeited property shall be returned to the Company.
