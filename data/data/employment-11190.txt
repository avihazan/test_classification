# 13. Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights. Executive agrees to continue to abide by the Confidentiality Agreement, which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B.

# 

# 14. Nondisparagement. Executive agrees not to disparage, defame or make any negative or critical public statements, whether verbally or in writing, regarding the personal or business reputation, technology, products, practices or conduct of Company or any of Company’s officers or directors. In addition, except as required by law, Executive shall not make any public statements regarding Company without the prior written approval of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Company agrees not to disparage, defame or make any negative or critical public statements, whether verbally or in writing, regarding the personal or business reputation of Executive.

# 15. Injunctive Relief.

# 

# 16. General Provisions.

# 

## 16.1. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Company. Executive shall not be entitled to assign any of Executive’s rights or obligations under this Agreement.

## 

## 16.2. Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege; and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

## 

## 16.3. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the parties shall receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable, invalid or illegal provision shall be deemed deleted, and the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.

## 

## 16.4. Interpretation; Construction. The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that Executive has had an opportunity to review the Agreement and has had it reviewed and negotiated by legal counsel acting on his/her behalf, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.

The Executive further understands and agrees that the Executive shall execute the Company’s standard agreement to arbitrate, which is separate from this Agreement and may be contained in the Company’s Employee Handbook. This Agreement will be the exclusive method to resolve all disputes or controversies that the Executive or the Company may have, whether or not arising out of the Executive’s employment or termination of that employment with the Company, except as provided in Section 15 hereof. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY RIGHT THAT THE EXECUTIVE OR THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE ANY CLAIM IN COURT IN A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL.
