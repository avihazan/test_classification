3\. Voting Rights and Dividends. Prior to the distribution of the Restricted Stock, certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock will be held by the Company (the “Custodian”) in your name. The Custodian will take such action as is necessary and appropriate to enable you to vote the Restricted Stock. All cash dividends received by the Custodian, if any, with respect to the Restricted Stock will be remitted to you. Stock dividends issued with respect to the Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of Restricted Stock that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions that apply to the shares of Restricted Stock.
