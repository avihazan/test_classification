iv. Subject to the provisions of Section 7, if the Grantee's employment is terminated for any reason other than (x) Retirement, (y) death or Disability, or (z) for Cause, the Covered Options shall remain exercisable solely until the first to occur of (A) the 90th day following the date of such termination or (B) the Normal Expiration Date, and shall automatically terminate and be canceled upon the expiration of such period. 

v. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, if the Grantee's employment with the Company or any Subsidiary is terminated for Cause (or if, following the date of termination of the Grantee's employment for any reason, the Committee determines that circumstances exist such that the Grantee's employment could have been terminated for Cause), all Options (whether or not

then vested or exercisable) shall automatically terminate and be canceled immediately upon such termination. 

5. Restrictions on Exercise; Non-Transferability of Options.

a. Restrictions on Exercise. Once vested in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Options may be exercised only with respect to full shares of Common Stock. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Options may not be exercised in whole or in part, and the Exercise Shares shall not be delivered, (i) unless all requisite approvals and consents of any governmental authority of any kind having jurisdiction over the exercise of the Options shall have been secured, and (ii) unless Section 5(c) shall have been satisfied. 

b. Non-Transferability of Options. Except as provided in the Plan, the Options may be exercised only by the Grantee or, following his death, by the Grantee's estate. Except as provided in the Plan, the Options are not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not, directly or indirectly, be offered, transferred, sold, pledged, assigned, alienated, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of or encumbered (including, without limitation, by gift, operation of law, or otherwise) other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution to the estate of the Grantee upon the Grantee's death, provided that the deceased Grantee's beneficiary or the representative of the Grantee's estate shall acknowledge and agree in writing, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan as if such beneficiary or the estate were the Grantee. 

c. Withholding. Whenever Shares are to be issued pursuant to the Options, the Company may require the recipient of the Shares to remit to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy the statutory minimum U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax withholding requirements as a condition to the issuance of such Shares. In the event any cash is paid to the Grantee or the Grantee's estate or beneficiary pursuant to Section 7 hereof or any provision of the Plan, the Company shall have the right to withhold an amount from such payment sufficient to satisfy the statutory minimum U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax withholding requirements. The Committee may, in its discretion, require or permit the Grantee to elect, subject to such conditions as the Committee shall impose, to meet such obligations by having the Company withhold the number of Shares having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy all or part of the Grantee's estimated total statutory minimum U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax obligation with respect to the issuance of Shares upon exercise of Options. 

6. Manner of Exercise. To the extent that any outstanding Options shall have become and remain vested and exercisable as provided in Sections 3 and 4 and subject to such reasonable administrative regulations as the Committee may have adopted, such Options may be exercised, in whole or in part, by notice to the designated officer of the Company (or designated third party administrator, if any) in writing given at least 5 business days (or shorter period permitted by any third party administrator) prior to the date as of which the Grantee will so exercise the Options (the "Exercise Date"), specifying the number of whole Shares with respect to which the Options are being exercised (the "Exercise Shares") and the aggregate Exercise Price for such Exercise Shares. On or before the Exercise Date, the Grantee shall fully pay for the Exercise Shares by delivering to the Company an amount in United States dollars equal to the product of the number of Exercise

Shares multiplied by the Exercise Price (such product, the "Aggregate Exercise Price"). The Grantee may pay the Aggregate Exercise Price: (i) in cash or cash equivalents satisfactory to the Company, (ii) subject to such limitations, holding periods, and other restrictions as the Committee may establish, by tendering shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date equal to the Aggregate Exercise Price, (iii) by any combination of the foregoing, and (iv) by any other method of payment as is permitted by applicable law and approved by the Committee. As soon as practicable after receipt of a written exercise notice and receipt of the Aggregate Exercise Price, the Company shall deliver the Exercise Shares to the Grantee in book-position or certificate form. The Company may require the Grantee to furnish or execute such other documents as the Company shall reasonably deem necessary (i) to evidence such exercise and (ii) to comply with or satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act, applicable state or non-U.S. securities laws, or any other law. 

7. Recapitalization; Change in Control. In the event of a recapitalization subject to Section 4.4 of the Plan or a Change in Control of the Company, the Grantee’s rights with respect to any Options granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan. 

8. No Rights as Stockholder. The Grantee shall have no voting or other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares covered by the Options until the exercise of the Options and the issuance of the Exercise Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of the Exercise Shares. 

9. Miscellaneous.

a. Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given if delivered personally or sent by certified or express mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by any recognized international equivalent of such delivery, to the Company or the Grantee, as the case may be, at the following addresses or to such other address as the Company or the Grantee, as the case may be, shall specify by notice to the others:

The waiver by any party hereto or beneficiary hereof of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach and no failure by a party or beneficiary to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of such party's or beneficiary's rights or privileges hereunder or shall be deemed a waiver of such party's or beneficiary's rights to exercise the same at any subsequent time or times hereunder.

e. Applicable Law. As a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the Company has an interest in having Delaware law applied to contracts with its employees, as well as disputes with them. Applying Delaware law in this fashion affords the parties predictability as to the law to be applied, as well as uniformity across the Company’s workforce.
