* * *

##### 

(d) use its best efforts to register or qualify the Purchaser’s Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement under the securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Purchaser may reasonably request, provided, however, that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; 

(e) list the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement with any securities exchange on which the Common Stock of the Company is then listed; 

(f) immediately notify the Purchaser at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of which the Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; and 

(g) make available for inspection by the Purchaser and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Purchaser, all publicly available, non-confidential financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees to supply all publicly available, non-confidential information reasonably requested by the attorney, accountant or agent of the Purchaser. 

4\. Registration Expenses. Expenses relating to the Company’s compliance with Sections 2 and 3 hereof, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the Company, fees and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying with state securities or “blue sky” laws, fees of the NASD, transfer taxes, fees of transfer agents and registrars, fees of, and disbursements incurred by, one counsel for the Holders are called “Registration Expenses”.

5\. Indemnification. 

(a) In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, and its officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Holder, or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or

##### 

are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Holder, and each such person for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any such person in writing specifically for use in any such document. 

(b) In the event of a registration of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact which was furnished in writing by the Purchaser to the Company expressly for use in (and such information is contained in) the Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such person for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that the Purchaser will be liable in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Purchaser specifically for use in any such document. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any person or entity in excess of the amount of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Purchaser in respect of Registrable Securities in connection with any such registration under the Securities Act. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to claim indemnification hereunder (an “Indemnified Party”) of notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against a party hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (an “Indemnifying Party”), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party other than under this Section 5(c) and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) if and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume and undertake the 

Registration Rights Agreement 

5 

* * *

##### 

defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; if the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, then the Indemnified Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of such counsel, provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select one separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. 

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in the event of joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) the Purchaser, or any officer, director or controlling person of the Purchaser, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 5 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of the Purchaser or such officer, director or controlling person of the Purchaser in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 5; then, and in each such case, the Company and the Purchaser will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that the Purchaser is responsible only for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its securities offered by the Registration Statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such Registration Statement, provided, however, that, in any such case, (A) the Purchaser will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration Statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

6\. Representations and Warranties. 

(a) The Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and, except with respect to certain matters which the Company has disclosed to the Purchaser on Schedule 12(u) to the Security Agreement, the Company has timely filed all proxy statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act. The Company has filed (i) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and (ii) its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005 (collectively, the “SEC Reports”). Each SEC Report was, at the time of its filing, in substantial compliance with the requirements of its respective form and none of the SEC Reports, nor the financial statements (and the notes thereto) included in the SEC Reports, as of their respective filing dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which 

Registration Rights Agreement 

6 

* * *

##### 

they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the Commission or other applicable rules and regulations with respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except (i) as may be otherwise indicated in such financial statements or the notes thereto or (ii) in the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may not include footnotes or may be condensed) and fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, the results of operations and the cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of, and for, the periods presented in each such SEC Report. 

(b) The Common Stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market and satisfies all requirements for the continuation of such listing, and the Company shall do all things necessary for the continuation of such listing. The Company has not received any notice that its Common Stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market (except for prior notices which have been fully remedied) or that the Common Stock does not meet all requirements for the continuation of such listing 

(c) Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf, has directly or indirectly made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security under circumstances that would cause the offering of the Securities pursuant to the Security Agreement to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act which would prevent the Company from selling the Common Stock pursuant to Rule 506 under the Securities Act, or any applicable exchange-related stockholder approval provisions, nor will the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries take any action or steps that would cause the offering of the Common Stock to be integrated with other offerings (other than such concurrent offering to the Purchaser). 

(d) The Warrants and the shares of Common Stock that the Purchaser may acquire pursuant to the Warrants are all restricted securities under the Securities Act as of the date of this Agreement. The Company will not issue any stop transfer order or other order impeding the sale and delivery of any of the Registrable Securities at such time as such Registrable Securities are registered for public sale or an exemption from registration is available, except as required by federal or state securities laws. 

(e) The Company understands the nature of the Registrable Securities issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant and recognizes that the issuance of such Registrable Securities may have a potential dilutive effect. The Company specifically acknowledges that its obligation to issue the Registrable Securities is binding upon the Company and enforceable regardless of the dilution such issuance may have on the ownership interests of other shareholders of the Company. 

(f) Except for agreements made in the ordinary course of business, there is no agreement that has not been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to a registration statement or to a form required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, the breach of which could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Company and its

subsidiaries, or would prohibit or otherwise interfere with the ability of the Company to enter into and perform any of its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. 

(g) The Company will at all times have authorized and reserved a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the full exercise of the Warrants. 

7\. Miscellaneous. 

(a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder, of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. 

(b) No Piggyback on Registrations. Except as and to the extent set forth on Schedule 7(b) hereto, neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall not after the date hereof enter into any agreement providing any such right for inclusion of shares in the Registration Statement to any of its security holders. Except as and to the extent specified in Schedule 7(b) hereto, the Company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities to any Person that have not been fully satisfied. 

(c) Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement. 

(d) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of a Discontinuation Event (as defined below), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the applicable Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised in writing (the “Advice”) by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this paragraph. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Discontinuation Event” shall mean (i) when the Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a “review” of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration Statement (the Company shall provide true and complete copies thereof and all written responses thereto to each of the Holders); (ii) any request by the Commission or any other Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any

(e) Piggy-Back Registrations. If at any time [during any Effectiveness Period][after the date hererof] there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered [during such Effectiveness Period][hereunder] and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each Holder written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered, to the extent the Company may do so without violating registration rights of others which exist as of the date of this Agreement, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights and subject to obtaining any required consent of any selling stockholder(s) to such inclusion under such registration statement. 

(f) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the Holders of the then outstanding Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of certain Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. 

(g) Notices. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to the Company or the Purchaser at the respective addresses set forth below or as may hereafter be specified in a notice designated as a change of address under this Section 7(g).

Re: Digital Recorders, Inc. Registration Statement on Form [S-3]

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

As counsel to Digital Recorders, Inc. , a North Carolina corporation (the “Company”), we have been requested to render our opinion to you in connection with the resale by the individuals or entitles listed on Schedule A attached hereto (the “Selling Stockholders”), of an aggregate of  shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock. 

A Registration Statement on Form [S-3] under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), with respect to the resale of the Shares was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on [date]. Enclosed is the Prospectus dated [date]. We understand that the Shares are to be offered and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus. 

Based upon the foregoing, upon request by the Selling Stockholders at any time while the registration statement remains effective, it is our opinion that the Shares have been registered for resale under the Act and new certificates evidencing the Shares upon their transfer or re-registration by the Selling Stockholders may be issued without restrictive legend. We will advise you if the registration statement is not available or effective at any point in the future. 

Very truly yours, 

[Company counsel]
