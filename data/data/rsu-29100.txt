MAGNUM HUNTER RESOURCES CORPORATION

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made by and between MAGNUM HUNTER RESOURCES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [________] (“Recipient”) as of [___________], pursuant to the Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

RECITALS

The Committee, acting on behalf of the Company, wishes to grant Recipient [___________] shares of the Company’s $0.01 par value common stock (“Common Stock”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below and in the Plan.

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement will have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.

AGREEMENT

It is hereby agreed as follows:

1\. Grant of Restricted Stock. Effective as of [___________] (the “Grant Date”), the Company will cause [___________] shares of Common Stock (the “Restricted Stock”) to be issued in Recipient’s name subject to any prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement with respect to the sale or other disposition of the Restricted Stock and the obligation to forfeit and surrender the Restricted Stock to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Plan (the “Forfeiture Restrictions”). The Restricted Stock had a Fair Market Value of $[____] on the Grant Date.

2\. Evidence of Ownership.

2.1 Evidence of the issuance of the Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement may be accomplished in any manner that the Company or its authorized representatives deem appropriate including, without limitation, electronic registration, book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates in the name of Recipient. Any stock certificate issued for the Restricted Stock will bear an appropriate legend with respect to the Forfeiture Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock. The Company may retain, at its option, the physical custody of any stock certificate representing any Restricted Stock during the restriction period or require that the certificates evidencing Restricted Stock be placed in escrow or trust, along with a stock power endorsed in blank, until all Forfeiture Restrictions are removed or lapse. If the issuance of the Restricted Stock is documented or recorded electronically, the Company and its authorized representatives will ensure that Recipient is prohibited from selling, assigning, pledging, exchanging, hypothecating or otherwise transferring the Restricted Stock while it is still subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions.

2.3 At the Company’s request, Recipient must execute and deliver, as necessary, a blank stock power with respect to the Restricted Stock, and the Company may, as necessary, exercise that stock power in the event of forfeiture of the Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement, or as may otherwise be required in order for the Company to withhold the Restricted Stock necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement.

3\. Forfeiture Restrictions.

7\. Tax Matters. The lapsing of the Forfeiture Restrictions will be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements (the “Required Withholding”), if any. By execution of this Agreement, Recipient authorizes the Company, to the extent permissible, to withhold sufficient Restricted Stock with respect to which the Forfeiture Restrictions have lapsed as may be necessary to satisfy Recipient’s Required Withholding, if any. The amount of the Required Withholding and the number of shares of Restricted Stock required to satisfy Recipient’s Required Withholding, if any, as well as the amount reflected on tax reports filed by the Company, will be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the day the Forfeiture Restrictions lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may require that Recipient satisfy Recipient’s Required Withholding, if any, by any other means the Committee, in its sole discretion, considers reasonable. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement are conditioned on the satisfaction of the Required Withholding, if any.

8\. No Right to Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement obligates the Company to employ or have another relationship with Recipient for any period or interfere in any way with the right of the Company to reduce Recipient’s compensation or to terminate the employment of or relationship with Recipient at any time.
