B. Company now wishes to continue to employ Mr. Gjerdrum, and Mr. Gjerdrum wishes to continue to be so employed, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Existing Agreement is hereby superceded and replaced in its entirety. 

NOW, THEREFORE, Company and Mr. Gjerdrum hereby agree as follows:

1\. Employment; Term. Company hereby employs Mr. Gjerdrum, and Mr. Gjerdrum hereby accepts employment with Company, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

2\. Duties. (a) During the Term, Mr. Gjerdrum shall serve as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of Company and shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of Company. Mr. Gjerdrum will have such duties and responsibilities as are customary for Mr. Gjerdrum’s positions and any other duties or responsibilities he may be reasonably assigned by Company’s Chief Executive Officer. 

(b) During the period Mr. Gjerdrum is employed by Company, Mr. Gjerdrum shall be required to devote his full business time and best efforts exclusively to the business and affairs of Company and will not directly or indirectly engage in any other business or competitive activity which has not been disclosed to and approved in writing by Company. 

(c) Except in the ordinary course of performing his duties hereunder, in accordance with Company’s annual business plan and any other guidelines or policies approved by Company’s Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors, Mr. Gjerdrum shall not have the authority to create or execute any contract or obligation, either express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of Company or any of its affiliates, which is intended to be binding upon Company or for which Company would be liable without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. 

3\. Compensation. (a) Company shall pay Mr. Gjerdrum a salary of One Hundred Sixty-Five Thousand Dollars ($165,000.00) per annum (the “Base Salary”). In addition,

##### 

Mr. Gjerdrum will receive a one-time signing payment in the amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) (“Signing Payment”) upon execution of this Agreement and a year-end performance bonus provided he is continuously employed by Company through and until June 30th of each year (the “Vesting Date”) during the Term (“Percentage Compensation”).

If any provision of this Agreement, or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the scope or duration of or the area covered by that provision, the court making that determination shall reduce the scope, duration of or area covered by that provision or otherwise amend the provision to the minimum extent necessary to make that provision enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

18\. Survivability. The provisions of this Agreement that by their terms call for performance subsequent to termination of Mr. Gjerdrum’s employment hereunder, or of this Agreement, will survive such termination. 

19\. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws.

The award of the arbitrators may be vacated or corrected pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction refuses to review the arbitration award for errors of law or legal reasoning, at the request of either party, a three-person private review panel shall hear such matters. Each of the parties shall select one member of the private review panel, and these two panel members shall select the third member of the panel. Any judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any such arbitration, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any award or judgment, full costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with such proceeding or arbitration.
