NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows: 

I. Employment Duties and Term.   
  
A. Duties. Company agrees to employ Executive as President, Unified Communications. Executive shall perform for or on behalf of Company such duties as are customary for such position and such other duties as Company shall assign from time to time, including duties for other entities which now are, or in the future may be, affiliated with Company (the “Affiliates”).

Executive shall serve Company and the Affiliates faithfully, diligently and to the best of his/her ability. Executive shall devote all working time, ability, and attention to the business of Company during the term of this Agreement and shall not, directly or indirectly, render any services to or for the benefit of any other business, corporation, organization, or entity, whether for compensation or otherwise, that appears to create a conflict between the interests of the Company and Executive, without the prior knowledge and written consent of Company. 

B. Term. The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall commence on September 28, 2009 (“Commencement Date”) and shall continue until the Agreement is terminated pursuant to an event described in Section III of this Agreement. 

II. Compensation.

B. Voluntary Termination Without Good Reason. If Executive voluntarily terminates his/her employment for a reason other than Good Reason (as defined herein) and provides the Company (and does not revoke) an executed release pursuant to Section III.H., then Executive shall receive the following payments (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld): 

1\. the Accrued Obligations; and

* * *

2\. provided the Executive is providing consulting services pursuant to Section IV, an amount equal to one times the Executive’s Base Salary, payable in equal installments on the Company’s regular pay dates, for the one-year period beginning on the date of termination, which payments shall cease if Executive’s consulting services cease prior to the end of such period. 

C. Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Voluntary Termination for Good Reason. If the Company terminates this Agreement without Cause (as defined below) or if Executive terminates this Agreement with Good Reason (as defined below), and in either case Executive provides (and does not revoke) an executed release pursuant to Section III.H., then Executive shall receive the following payments (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld): 

1\. the Accrued Obligations; 

2\. an amount equal to one times the Executive’s Base Salary, payable in equal installments on the Company’s regular pay dates, for the one-year period beginning on the date of termination; and

D. For purposes of this Agreement, Executive shall have “Good Reason” to terminate this Agreement if one of the following events occurs without the Executive’s express written consent: 

1\. both (i) a reduction in any material respect in the Executive’s position(s), duties or responsibilities with the Company, and (ii) an adverse material change in the Executive’s reporting responsibilities, titles or offices with the Company, other than, for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), a reduction or adverse change attributable to the fact that the Company is no longer a privately-held company; 

2\. a reduction of 20 percent (20%) or more in the Executive’s rate of annual Base Salary other than a reduction made after the Company determines such reduction is a reasonably necessary step or component to address potential breaches or violations of any debt covenants; or 

3\. any requirement of the Company that the Executive be based more than 50 miles from the facility where the Executive is based as of the Commencement Date. 

3 

* * *

In order to terminate this Agreement for Good Reason, Executive must first satisfy the following notice and opportunity to cure requirements. Before terminating this Agreement and his/her employment hereunder for Good Reason, Executive must give written notice to Company as to the details of the basis for such Good Reason within thirty (30) days following the date on which Executive alleges the event giving rise to such Good Reason occurred, and Company must fail to provide a reasonable cure within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice. 

E. Termination for Cause. Company, upon written notice to Executive, may terminate the employment of Executive at any time for Cause. For purposes of this Paragraph, “Cause” shall be deemed to exist if, and only if, the President of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer of West Corporation, in good faith, determine that Executive has engaged, during the performance of his/her duties hereunder, in significant objective acts or omissions constituting dishonesty, willful misconduct, or gross negligence relating to the business of Company. 

F. If Company terminates this Agreement and Executive’s employment hereunder for Cause (as defined herein), then Executive shall be entitled only to the Accrued Obligations. Executive hereby agrees that no bonus shall be earned in the calendar year in which the Executive is terminated for Cause. 

G. Transfers within Company or any of its Affiliates. In the event Executive and Company agree that Executive will transfer to another position within Company or any of its Affiliates, the terms of this Agreement, other than the applicable Exhibit A in effect at the time of the transfer, shall remain in effect and govern Executive’s relationship with Company or any of its Affiliates in his/her new position. Upon Executive’s transfer to another position within Company or any of its Affiliates, Company shall be obligated under this Agreement and the applicable Exhibit A at the time of transfer only to pay Executive’s Base Salary earned through the date of transfer and any Earned Bonus through the end of the month immediately preceding the date of transfer, determined in accordance with Section II.B., and to reimburse Executive for expenses properly incurred through the date of transfer. Executive and the Affiliate to which Executive’s employment is transferred may agree to a new Exhibit A covering Executive’s new position to replace the Exhibit A in effect at the time of transfer. In the event no such Exhibit A is agreed upon, Executive will be entitled to the same Base Salary as Executive was receiving at the time of the transfer, but shall not be entitled to earn any further bonus or have any other rights under the Exhibit A previously in effect. 

H. Additional Terms. Upon termination for any reason Executive (i) agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to Company at Company’s expense in winding up Executive’s work for Company and transferring that work to other individuals as designated by Company, and (ii) agrees reasonably to cooperate with Company in litigation as requested by Company. 

To be eligible for any payments under this section, Executive must (i) execute and deliver to Company, within 45 days after Executive’s date of termination, a final and complete release in a form that is acceptable and approved by Company (and not revoke such release), and (ii) in Company’s good faith belief, be in full compliance with his/her Restrictive Covenants of Section V below.

IV. Consulting   
  
A. In the event of termination of employment pursuant to Section III.B or III.C above, Company and Executive agree that Company shall retain the services of Executive as a consultant for a period of one year[s] from the date of termination and that Executive will serve as a consultant to Company. 

B. During the period of consulting, Executive shall be acting as an independent contractor. As part of the consulting services, Executive agrees to provide certain services to Company, including, but not limited to, the following: 

1\. oral and written information with reference to continuing programs and new programs which were developed or under development under the supervision of Executive; 

2\. meeting with officers and managers of Company to discuss and review programs and to make recommendations; 

3\. analysis, opinion and information regarding the effectiveness and public acceptance of their programs. 

C. During the consulting period, Executive shall continue to receive, as compensation for his consulting, the payments set forth in Sections III.B.2 and III.C.3 above payable in installments concurrent with Company’s executive payroll schedule (but not less frequently than monthly). Except as provided in Section III.C.3 above, no bonus of any kind will be paid during the period of consulting. 

D. Executive hereby agrees that during the period of consulting, Executive will devote his/her full attention, energy and skill to the performance of his/her duties and to furthering the interest of Company and affiliates, which shall include, and Executive acknowledges, a fiduciary duty and obligation to Company. Executive acknowledges that such consulting shall terminate upon commencement of Other Employment pursuant to Section IV. 

E. Executive and Company hereby agree that Executive may terminate the consulting services at any time and thereby terminate all payment obligations of the Company (other than those pursuant to Section III.B.1, III.C.1 and III.C.2). Executive and Company hereby agree that in the event Executive chooses, during the term of the consulting period to singly, jointly, or as a member, employer or agent of any partnership, or as an officer, agent, employee, director, stockholder or investor of any other corporation or entity, or in any other capacity, engage in any business endeavors of any kind or nature whatsoever, other than those of Company or its Affiliates and other than those existing at the time of entering into this agreement without the express written consent of Company (“Other Employment”) the consulting period shall terminate immediately and all further obligations of the Company shall terminate (other than those pursuant to Section III.B.1, III.C.1 and III.C.2); provided, however, that Executive may own stock in a publicly traded corporation. Executive agrees that Company may at its sole discretion give or withhold its consent and understands that Company’s consent will not be unreasonably withheld if the following conditions are met: 

1\. Executive’s intended employment will not interfere in Company’s opinion with Executive’s duties and obligations as a consultant, including the fiduciary duty assumed hereunder; and 

5 

* * *

2\. Executive’s intended employment or activity would not, in the opinion of Company, place Executive in a situation where confidential information of Company or its Affiliates known to Executive may benefit Executive’s new Company; and 

3\. Executive’s new employment will not, in Company’s opinion, result, directly or indirectly, in competition with Company or its Affiliates, then or in the future. 

F. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of Section IV shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination of any consulting period. 

G. Company shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable business expenses incurred by Executive in furtherance of his/her consulting duties pursuant to this Agreement provided the expenses are pre-approved by Company. 

H. Benefits During Consulting Period. During the period of consulting, Executive shall continue to be covered under all medical, dental, vision, flexible spending account and Executive assistance plans or programs with respect to the Executive and the Executive’s dependents with the same level of coverage, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as then provided to actively employed executives of Company unless Executive accepts new employment during the consulting term in accordance with Section IV above, in which event all benefits will cease, at Company’s option, when the new employment is accepted by Executive. The benefits provided shall include insurance benefits based upon eligibility pursuant to the applicable plans. If the insurance plans do not provide for continued participation, the continuation of benefits shall be pursuant to COBRA. In the event Executive’s benefits continue pursuant to COBRA and Executive accepts new employment during the consulting term, Executive may continue benefits thereafter to the extent allowed under COBRA. In no event shall the amounts of any benefits available under any such policy in any year affect the amount of benefits available in any other year or shall the right to any of such benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

V. Restrictive Covenants.   
  
A. Confidential Information. In the course of Executive’s employment, Executive will be provided with certain information, technical data and know-how regarding the business of Company and its Affiliates and their products, all of which is confidential (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information”). Independent of any obligation under any other section of the Agreement, Executive agrees to receive, hold and treat all Confidential Information received from Company and its Affiliates as confidential and secret and agrees to protect the secrecy of said Confidential Information. Executive agrees that the Confidential Information will be disclosed only to those persons who are required to have such knowledge in connection with 

6 

* * *

their work for Company and that such Confidential Information will not be disclosed to others without the prior written consent of the Company. The provisions hereof shall not be applicable to: (a) information which at the time of disclosure to Executive is a matter of public knowledge; or (b) information which, after disclosure to Executive, becomes public knowledge other than through a breach of this Agreement. Unless the Confidential Information shall be of the type herein before set forth, Executive shall not use such Confidential Information for his/her own benefit or for a third party’s or parties’ benefit at any time. Upon termination of employment, Executive will return all books, records and other materials provided to or acquired by or created by Executive during the course of employment which relate in any way to Company or its business. The obligations imposed upon Executive by this paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

B. Covenant Not to Compete. The parties understand that as a part of his/her job duties, Executive will be exposed to certain Confidential Information, client and potential client relationships, and supplier, licensee, or other business relationships of the Company and its Affiliates (some of which may be developed by Executive in the course of Executive’s employment). Employee acknowledges such information is the sole and exclusive property of the Company constituting valuable, special and unique property of the Company in which the Company has and will have a protectable interest. The parties therefore agree that it is necessary to enter into this Agreement to protect the Company’s interests. Independent of any obligation under any other contract or agreement between Executive and the Company, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the separation of his/her employment with the Company, the Executive shall not: 

1\. directly or indirectly, for himself/herself, or as agent of, or on behalf of, or in connection with, any person, firm, association or corporation, directly or indirectly contact, solicit business from, or in any way do business with any customer, prospective customer, or account of the Company or any of its Affiliates with whom Executive had personal contact during the course of his/her employment with Company; or 

2\. directly or indirectly, for himself/herself, or as agent of, or on behalf of, or in connection with, any person, firm, association or corporation, induce or attempt to induce any supplier, licensee or other business relation of the Company or any of its Affiliates with whom Executive had personal contact during the course of his/her employment with Company, to cease doing business with the Company or any of its Affiliates or in any way interfere with the Company’s relationship or cause Company’s costs to increase with any such supplier, licensee, or other business relation of the Company. Executive further acknowledges that in view of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged, the restrictions contained in this section are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Company. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that any violation of this section will result in irreparable injuries to the Company. Executive, therefore, acknowledges that in the event of his/her violation of the provisions of this section, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and damages and an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled. In addition to other available remedies, Executive’s breach of this section shall entitle Company to return of any amounts paid pursuant to Section III.B. or Section III.C. of this Agreement.

* * *

C. Developments. 

1\. Executive will make full and prompt disclosure to Company of all inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software and works of authorship, whether patentable or not, which are created, made, conceived, reduced to practice by Executive or under his/her direction or jointly with others during his/her employment by Company, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of Company which relate to the business of Company as conducted from time to time (all of which are collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Developments”). 

2\. Executive agrees to assign, and does hereby assign, to Company (or any person or entity designated by Company) all of his/her right, title and interest in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications. 

3\. Executive agrees to cooperate fully with Company, both during and after his/her employment with Company, with respect to the procurement, maintenance and enforcement of copyrights and patents (both in the United States and foreign countries) relating to Developments. Executive shall sign all papers, including, without limitation, copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignment or priority rights, and powers of attorney, which Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interest in any Developments. 

D. Diversion of Employees. During the term of Executive’s employment under this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year after the termination of his/her employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, (i) induce or attempt to influence any person employed by Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate his or her relationship with the Company; (ii) employ or recommend for employment (other than in response to potential employers seeking job references about employees they specifically identify by name) any person employed by Company or any of its Affiliates; or (iii) identify for purposes of employment any person employed by Company or any of its Affiliates. The purpose and intent of the provisions of this section is to prevent Executive, in any capacity or relationship, from participating in or encouraging, in any manner, the hiring of any person employed by Company or any of its Affiliates by any other entity or person for a period of one (1) year after termination of his/her employment with the Company. The provisions of this section shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement or of Executive’s employment. 

Executive acknowledges that in the event of his/her violation of the provisions of this section, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and damages, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled. In addition to other available remedies, Executive’s breach of this section shall entitle Company to return of any amounts paid pursuant to Sections III.B. or III.C. of this Agreement (other than the Earned Bonus and Accrued Obligations). 

8 

* * *

VI. General Provisions.   
  
A. Non-Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted hereunder, or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition, but the obligations of either party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect. 

B. Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Company, its successors, and assigns, including without limitation, any person, partnership, or corporation that may acquire voting control of Company or all or substantially all of its assets and business, or that may be a party to any consolidation, merger, or other transaction. 

C. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, between the parties with respect to the employment of the Executive by the Company, whether oral or written. This Agreement may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement in writing signed by both parties. 

D. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State where Company’s principal office is located. 

E. Taxes. Any payments or benefits under this Agreement shall be subject to all applicable taxes and other withholding obligations and the Company is authorized to withhold any such amounts as may be required by applicable law. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder to the extent applicable. For purposes of determining whether any payment made pursuant to this Agreement results in a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b), the Company shall maximize the exemptions described in such section, as applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, it is intended that all amounts payable during the consulting period specified in Section IV shall be remuneration for actual services performed during such consulting period. To the extent the Company decides, in its sole discretion, that it shall discontinue or reduce the amount of services required to be performed by Executive during the consulting period such that Executive has a “separation from service,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such separation shall be considered an involuntary separation of service by the Company for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and any payments for periods after such separation from service shall be considered as payments on account of such involuntary separation from service. The Company does not warrant or promise compliance with Section 409A of the Code and neither Executive nor any other person shall have any claim against the Company for any action taken by the Company to comply with Section 409A. By entering into this Agreement, Executive releases the Company, its Board, its employees and agents from and against any liability related to any failure to follow the requirements of Section 409A or any guidance or regulations thereunder, unless such failure was the result of an action or failure to act that was undertaken by the Company in bad faith. Any reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided pursuant to this Agreement 

9 

* * *

that are taxable to Executive shall be subject to the following restrictions: (i) each reimbursement must be paid no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year during which the expense was incurred or tax was remitted, as the case may be; and (ii) the amount of expenses or taxes eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses or taxes eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Executive is a “specified employee”, as defined in Section 409A of the Code, as of the date of Executive’s separation from service, then to the extent any amount payable under this Agreement (i) constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (ii) is payable upon Executive’s separation from service, and (iii) under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of Executive’s separation from service, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (a) the six-month anniversary of the separation from service or (b) the date of Executive’s death. To the extent that any amounts are payable under this Agreement by reference to Executive’s termination of employment, such termination of employment shall occur at the time of Executive’s “separation from service”, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 

F. Construction. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall in all cases by construed as a whole according to its fair meaning, strictly neither for nor against either party hereto, and without implying a presumption that the terms thereof shall be more strictly construed against one party by reason of the rule of construction that a document is to be construed more strictly against the person whom himself or through his agent prepared the same. 

G. Severability. If any portion of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that such invalidity or unenforceability shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other portion of this Agreement. 

H. Notice. For purposes of this Agreement, all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or 5 days after deposit in the United States mail, certified and return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

To: Todd Strubbe 

From: West Corporation Compensation Committee 

Date: February 11, 2010 

Re: Exhibit A 

This Exhibit A for 2010 is entered into pursuant to your Employment Agreement. 

1. Your base salary will be $500,000.00.   
  
2. Effective January 1, 2010, you will be eligible to receive a bonus based on achieving the Unified Communications segment Net Operating Income before Corporate Allocations and Before Amortization at the rate outlined below.   
  
Net Operating Income Before Corporate 

Allocations and Before Amortization

Rate  
  
$0 - $422,000,000

0.095 %   
  
Over $422,000,000

1.0 %   
  
A maximum of 75% of the pro-rata portion of the bonus may be advanced quarterly. If any portion of the bonus is advanced, it will be paid within thirty (30) days from the end of the quarter. 100% of the total bonus earned will be paid no later than February 28, 2011. In the event there is a negative calculation at the end of any quarter and a pro-rata portion of the bonus has been advanced in a previous quarter, “loss carry forward” will result and applied to the next quarterly or year-to-date be applied to the next quarterly or year-to-date calculation. In the event that at the end of the year, or upon your termination if earlier, the aggregate amount of the bonus which has been advanced exceeds the amount of bonus that otherwise would have been payable for 2010 (in the absence of advances) based on the performance during 2010, (or, in the case of your termination, based on the performance during 2010 and the projection for performance for the balance of 2010 as of your termination date), then the amount of such excess may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, either (i) result in a “loss carry forward” which shall be applied to the next quarterly or year-to-date calculation of bonus payable in subsequent periods, or (ii) be required to be paid back to the company upon such request. 

3. In addition, if West Corporation achieves its 2010 publicly stated Adjusted EBITDA guidance, you will be eligible to receive an additional one-time bonus of $100,000. This bonus is not to be combined or netted together with any other bonus set forth in this agreement.   
  
4. All objectives are based upon West Corporation and the Unified Communications segment operations, and will not include income derived from other mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, stock buy backs or other non-operating income unless specifically and individually approved by West Corporation’s Compensation Committee.   
  
5. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, you may receive an additional bonus based on the Company’s and your individual performance.
