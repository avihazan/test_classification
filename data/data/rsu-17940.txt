Any questions as to the existence of a Permanent Disability shall be determined by a qualified, independent physician selected by the Company and approved by the Participant (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The determination of any such physician shall be final and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.  
  
(c)

Termination by a Group Company not for Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason: Except as provided in Sections 2(e) and 2(f) below, 45% of the unvested portion of the Award shall vest (i) in the event the Participant’s employment is terminated by a Group Company not for Cause, upon the delivery by such Group Company of a notice of termination not for Cause, or (ii) in the event the Participant’s employment is terminated by the Participant for Good Reason, at the end of the applicable correction period following the Participant’s delivery of Good Reason Notice, so long as the Group Company has not corrected the event or condition giving rise to Good Reason by the end of the correction period; and the remaining 55% of the unvested portion of the Award will vest on the last vesting date for such award as set forth in the Grant Letter but only if the Participant (i) delivers to the Company a legal release letter in a form satisfactory to the Company and (ii) does not breach (a) any confidentiality, noncompetition, non-solicitation or assignment of inventions policies, terms, conditions or
