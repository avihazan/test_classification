2\. Termination of Continuous Service. Subject to the terms of any employment agreement between you and the Company and/or its Affiliates, this Award shall be canceled and become automatically null and void immediately after termination of your Continuous Service for any reason, but only to the extent you have not become vested, pursuant to the foregoing terms, on or at the time your Continuous Service ends. 

3\. Dividends; Voting Rights. As the owner of record of any Restricted Shares you qualify to receive pursuant to this Award Agreement, you will be entitled to receive cash dividends and to vote such Restricted Shares; subject to expiration of such rights thereunder (but not for Shares that have vested pursuant to this Award) upon termination of your Continuous Service before the particular record date for determining shareholders of record entitled to the payment of the cash or Share-based dividends or to vote. 

With respect to any dividends that are paid in Shares between the date of this Award and your receipt of Shares pursuant to a vesting event, such Shares shall be subject to the same vesting restrictions contained in Section 1 as the Restricted Shares with respect to which the dividend is paid. When Shares are delivered to you or your duly-authorized transferee pursuant to the vesting of the Restricted Shares, you or your duly-authorized transferee shall also be entitled to receive, with respect to each Share delivered, a number of Shares equal to the Share-based dividends which were declared and paid to the holders of Shares between the Grant Date and the date such Share is issued to you, after your interest vests. To the extent that either (i) your Continuous Service ends before vesting of the Restricted Shares subject to this Award or (ii) your Continuous Service does not result in full vesting of this Award, you will forfeit all Share-based dividends (but not cash dividends) attributable to all such non-vested Restricted Shares. 

4\. Issuance and Vesting of Restricted Shares. The Company will hold all Restricted Shares in escrow, in book entry form, until vesting occurs. You will be reflected as the owner of record on the Company’s books and records of any Restricted Shares credited to you pursuant to this Award Agreement. If you forfeit any Restricted Shares, they will be transferred back to the Company. As soon as practicable after vesting of your Restricted Shares, and upon satisfaction of any tax withholding requirements, but no later than the 15th day of the third month following the calendar year in which such vesting occurs, the Company shall release to you, free from vesting restrictions, one Share for each vested Restricted Share. Your Restricted Shares will also be reflected on the Company’s books and records as vested Shares. 

5\. Section 83(b) Election Notice. If you make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), as amended, with respect to the Shares underlying your Restricted Shares (a “Section 83(b) election”), you agree to provide a copy of such election to the Company within 10 days after filing that election with the Internal Revenue Service. Exhibit A contains a suggested form of Section 83(b) election.
