ZONES, INC.  

  
Zones, Inc. has granted to the individual (the “Optionee”) named in the Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the “Notice”) to which this Stock Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) is attached an option (the “Option”) to purchase certain shares of Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice and this Option Agreement. The Option has been granted pursuant to and shall in all respects be subject to the terms and conditions of the Zones, Inc. 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as amended to the Date of Option Grant, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. By signing the Notice, the Optionee: (a) represents that the Optionee has received copies of, and has read and is familiar with the terms and conditions of, the Notice, the Plan and this Option Agreement, (b) accepts the Option subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Notice, the Plan and this Option Agreement, and (c) agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Board upon any questions arising under the Notice, the Plan or this Option Agreement.   
  
1\. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.  
  
1.1 Definitions. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Notice or the Plan.  
  
1.2  Construction. Captions and titles contained herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Option Agreement. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. Use of the term “or” is not intended to be exclusive, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.   
  
2\.  TAX CONSEQUENCES.  
  
2.1 Tax Status of Option. This Option is intended to have the tax status designated in the Notice  
  
(a)  Incentive Stock Option. If the Notice so designates, this Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code, but the Company does not represent or warrant that this Option qualifies as such. The Optionee should consult with the Optionee’s own tax advisor regarding the tax effects of this Option and the requirements necessary to obtain favorable income tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, including, but not limited to, holding period requirements. (NOTE TO OPTIONEE: If the Option is exercised more than three (3) months after the date on which you cease to be an Employee (other than by reason of your death or permanent and total disability as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), the Option will be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option and not as an Incentive Stock Option to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code.)   
  
(b) Nonstatutory Stock Option. If the Notice so designates, this Option is intended to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option and shall not be treated as an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code.

2.2  ISO Fair Market Value Limitation. If the Notice designates this Option as an Incentive Stock Option, then to the extent that the Option (together with all Incentive Stock Options granted to the Optionee under all stock option plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) becomes exercisable for the first time during any calendar year for shares having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 2.2, options designated as Incentive Stock Options are taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock is determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a different limitation from that set forth in this Section 2.2, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If the Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 2.2, the Optionee may designate which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising. In the absence of such designation, the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first. Separate certificates representing each such portion shall be issued upon the exercise of the Option. (NOTE TO OPTIONEE: If the aggregate Exercise Price of the Option (that is, the Exercise Price multiplied by the Number of Option Shares) plus the aggregate exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Options you hold (whether granted pursuant to the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Participating Company Group) is greater than $100,000, you should contact the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to ascertain whether the entire Option qualifies as an Incentive Stock Option.)   
  
3. ADMINISTRATION.  
All questions of interpretation concerning this Option Agreement shall be determined by the Board. All determinations by the Board shall be final and binding upon all persons having an interest in the Option. Any Officer shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Company with respect to any matter, right, obligation, or election which is the responsibility of or which is allocated to the Company herein, provided the Officer has apparent authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, or election.   
  
4. EXERCISE OF THE OPTION.   
  
4.1 Right to Exercise. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Option shall be exercisable on and after the Date of Option Grant and prior to the termination of the Option (as provided in Section 6) in an amount not to exceed the number of Vested Shares less the number of shares previously acquired upon exercise of the Option. In no event shall the Option be exercisable for more shares than the Number of Option Shares.   
  
4.2 Method of Exercise. Exercise of the Option shall be by written notice to the Company which must state the election to exercise the Option, the number of whole shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised and such other representations and agreements as to the Optionee’s investment intent with respect to such shares as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Option Agreement. The written notice must be signed by the Optionee and must be delivered in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by confirmed facsimile transmission, or by such other means as the Company may permit, to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, or other authorized representative of the Participating Company Group, prior to the termination of the Option as set forth in Section 6, accompanied by full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased. The Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such written notice and the aggregate Exercise Price.

4.3 Payment of Exercise Price.   
  
(a) Forms of Consideration Authorized. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised shall be made (i) in cash, by check, or cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of whole shares of Stock owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market Value not less than the aggregate Exercise Price, (iii) by means of a Cashless Exercise, as defined in Section 4.3(b), or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.   
  
(b) Limitations on Forms of Consideration.  
  
(i) Tender of Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock. The Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months (and not used for another option exercise by attestation during such period). The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, to refuse to allow the exercise by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock.   
  
(ii) Cashless Exercise. A “Cashless Exercise” means the delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker in a form acceptable to the Company providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the Option pursuant to a program or procedure approved by the Company (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, to decline to approve or terminate any such program or procedure. Cashless exercise shall not be permitted if the exercise by means of a Cashless Exercise would be a violation of any law, including Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which prohibits public companies from making personal loans to any director or executive officer.   
  
4.4 Tax Withholding. At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Optionee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (i) the exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option, (ii) the transfer, in whole or in part, of any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option, (iii) the operation of any law or regulation providing for the imputation of interest, or (iv) the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Option is not exercisable unless the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group are satisfied. Accordingly, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group have been satisfied by the Optionee.

* * *

  
  
  
4.5 Certificate Registration. Except in the event the Exercise Price is paid by means of a Cashless Exercise, the certificate for the shares as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Optionee, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Optionee.   
  
4.6 Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of Shares. The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.   
  
4.7 Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise of the Option.  
  
5\. NONTRANSFERABILITY OF THE OPTION.  
The Option may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee or the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative and may not be assigned or transferred in any manner except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Following the death of the Optionee, the Option, to the extent provided in Section 7, may be exercised by the Optionee’s legal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Optionee’s will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.

6. TERMINATION OF THE OPTION.   
The Option shall terminate and may no longer be exercised after the first to occur of (a) the Option Expiration Date, (b) the last date for exercising the Option following termination of the Optionee’s Service as described in Section 7, or (c) a Change in Control to the extent provided in Section 8.   
  
7\. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE.   
  
7.1 Option Exercisability.   
  
(a) Disability. If the Optionee’s Service terminates because of the Disability of the Optionee, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.   
  
(b) Death. If the Optionee’s Service terminates because of the death of the Optionee, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Optionee’s death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. The Optionee’s Service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Optionee dies within three (3) months after the Optionee’s termination of Service (other than a termination for Cause).   
  
(c) Termination After Change in Control. If the Optionee’s Service ceases as a result of Termination After Change in Control (as defined below), (i) the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee (or the Optionee’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of eighteen (18) months after the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date, and (ii) the Option shall become immediately exercisable in full and the Vested Ratio shall be deemed to be 1/1 as of the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated.   
  
(d) Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Option Agreement, if the Optionee’s Service is terminated for Cause, the Option shall terminate and cease to be exercisable on the effective date of such termination of Service. Unless otherwise defined in a contract of employment or service between the Optionee and a Participating Company, for purposes of this Option Agreement “Cause” shall mean any of the following: (i) the Optionee’s theft, dishonesty, or falsification of any Participating Company documents or records; (ii) the Optionee’s improper use or disclosure of a Participating Company’s confidential or proprietary information; (iii) any action by the Optionee which has a detrimental effect on a Participating Company’s reputation or business; (iv) the Optionee’s failure or inability to perform any reasonable assigned duties after written notice from a Participating Company of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure, such failure or inability; (v) any material breach by the Optionee of any employment agreement between the Optionee and a Participating Company, which breach is not cured pursuant to the terms of such agreement; or (vi) the Optionee’s conviction (including any plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of any criminal act which impairs the Optionee’s ability to perform his or her duties with a Participating Company.

(e) Other Termination of Service. If the Optionee’s Service terminates for any reason, except Disability, death, Termination after Change in Control, or Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Optionee on the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months (or such other longer period of time as determined by the Board, in its discretion) after the date on which the Optionee’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.  
  
7.2 Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 7.1 is prevented by the provisions of Section 4.6, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Optionee is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.  
  
7.3 Extension if Optionee Subject to Section 16(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 7.1 of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Optionee to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which a sale of such shares by the Optionee would no longer be subject to such suit, (ii) the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Optionee’s termination of Service, or (iii) the Option Expiration Date.   
  
7.4 Certain Definitions.   
  
(a) “Termination After Change in Control” shall mean either of the following events occurring within eighteen (18) months after a Change in Control:   
  
(i) termination by the Participating Company Group of the Optionee’s Service with the Participating Company Group for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below); or   
  
(ii) the Optionee’s resignation for Good Reason (as defined below) from all capacities in which the Optionee is then rendering Service to the Participating Company Group within a reasonable period of time following the event constituting Good Reason.  
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Termination After Change in Control shall not include any termination of the Optionee’s Service with the Participating Company Group which (1) is for Cause (as defined below); (2) is a result of the Optionee’s death or Disability; (3) is a result of the Optionee’s voluntary termination of Service other than for Good Reason; or (4) occurs prior to the effectiveness of a Change in Control.

(b) “Cause” shall have the same meaning given such term in Section 7.1(d) hereof.   
  
(c) “Good Reason” shall mean any one or more of the following:   
  
(i) without the Optionee’s express written consent, the assignment to the Optionee of any duties, or any limitation of the Optionee’s responsibilities, substantially inconsistent with the Optionee’s positions, duties, responsibilities and status with the Participating Company Group immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control;   
  
(ii) without the Optionee’s express written consent, the relocation of the principal place of the Optionee’s Service to a location that is more than fifty (50) miles from the Optionee’s principal place of Service immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control, or the imposition of travel requirements substantially more demanding of the Optionee than such travel requirements existing immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control;   
  
(iii) any failure by the Participating Company Group to pay, or any material reduction by the Participating Company Group of, (1) the Optionee’s base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control (unless reductions comparable in amount and duration are concurrently made for all other employees of the Participating Company Group with responsibilities, organizational level and title comparable to the Optionee’s), or (2) the Optionee’s bonus compensation, if any, in effect immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control (subject to applicable performance requirements with respect to the actual amount of bonus compensation earned by the Optionee); or   
  
(iv) any failure by the Participating Company Group to (1) continue to provide the Optionee with the opportunity to participate, on terms no less favorable than those in effect for the benefit of any employee or service provider group which customarily includes a person holding the employment or service provider position or a comparable position with the Participating Company Group then held by the Optionee, in any benefit or compensation plans and programs, including, but not limited to, the Participating Company Group’s life, disability, health, dental, medical, savings, profit sharing, stock purchase and retirement plans, if any, in which the Optionee was participating immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control, or their equivalent, or (2) provide the Optionee with all other fringe benefits (or their equivalent) from time to time in effect for the benefit of any employee or service provider group which customarily includes a person holding the employment or service provider position or a comparable position with the Participating Company Group then held by the Optionee.

8\.  CHANGE IN CONTROL.   
  
8.1 Definitions.   
  
(a) An “Ownership Change Event” shall be deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs with respect to the Company: (i) the direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series of related transactions by the shareholders of the Company of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is a party; (iii) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.   
  
(b) A “Change in Control” shall mean an Ownership Change Event or a series of related Ownership Change Events (collectively, a “Transaction”) wherein the shareholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company’s voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or, in the case of a Transaction described in Section 8.1(a)(iii), the corporation or other business entity to which the assets of the Company were transferred (the “Transferee”), as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities which own the Company or the Transferee, as the case may be, either directly or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities. The Board shall have the right to determine whether multiple sales or exchanges of the voting securities of the Company or multiple Ownership Change Events are related, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.   
  
8.2  Effect of Change in Control on Option. In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiring Corporation”), may, without the consent of the Optionee, either assume the Company’s rights and obligations under the Option or substitute for the Option a substantially equivalent option (as determined by the Board) for the Acquiring Corporation’s stock. The Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control to the extent that the Option is neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of the Option prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of this Option Agreement except as otherwise provided herein. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the Option immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 8.1(a)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the Option shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion. The Board may, in its discretion, determine that upon a Change in Control the Option shall be canceled in exchange for payment with respect to each Vested Share subject to such Option immediately prior to its cancellation in (a) cash, (b) stock of the Company or the Acquiring Corporation or (c) other property which, in any such case, shall be in an amount having a Fair Market Value equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control over the Exercise Price per share under the Option (subject to any required tax withholding). Such payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Change in Control.

9\.  ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.   
In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number, Exercise Price and class of shares of stock subject to the Option. If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to the Option are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another corporation (the “New Shares”), the Board may unilaterally amend the Option to provide that the Option is exercisable for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the Number of Option Shares and the Exercise Price shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by the Board, in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 9 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the Exercise Price be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option. The adjustments determined by the Board pursuant to this Section 9 shall be final, binding and conclusive.   
  
10\.  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER, EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT.   
The Optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by the Option until the date of the issuance of a certificate for the shares for which the Option has been exercised (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 9. If the Optionee is an Employee, the Optionee understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Optionee, the Optionee’s employment is “at will” and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Optionee’s Service as an Employee or Consultant, as the case may be, at any time.

11\.  NOTICE OF SALES UPON DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION.   
The Optionee shall dispose of the shares acquired pursuant to the Option only in accordance with the provisions of this Option Agreement. In addition, if the Notice designates this Option as an Incentive Stock Option, the Optionee shall (a) promptly notify the Chief Financial Officer of the Company if the Optionee disposes of any of the shares acquired pursuant to the Option within one (1) year after the date the Optionee exercises all or part of the Option or within two (2) years after the Date of Option Grant and (b) provide the Company with a description of the circumstances of such disposition. Until such time as the Optionee disposes of such shares in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Option Agreement, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Company, the Optionee shall hold all shares acquired pursuant to the Option in the Optionee’s name (and not in the name of any nominee) for the one-year period immediately after the exercise of the Option and the two-year period immediately after Date of Option Grant. At any time during the one-year or two-year periods set forth above, the Company may place a legend on any certificate representing shares acquired pursuant to the Option requesting the transfer agent for the Company’s stock to notify the Company of any such transfers. The obligation of the Optionee to notify the Company of any such transfer shall continue notwithstanding that a legend has been placed on the certificate pursuant to the preceding sentence.   
  
12\. LEGENDS.   
The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of stock subject to the provisions of this Option Agreement. The Optionee shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to the Option in the possession of the Optionee in order to carry out the provisions of this Section. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, legends placed on such certificates may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:   
  
12.1  “THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED BY THE CORPORATION TO THE REGISTERED HOLDER UPON EXERCISE OF AN INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AS DEFINED IN SECTION 422 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (“ISO”). IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT AFFORDED TO ISOs, THE SHARES SHOULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED PRIOR TO [INSERT DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION DATE HERE]. SHOULD THE REGISTERED HOLDER ELECT TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE SHARES PRIOR TO THIS DATE AND FOREGO ISO TAX TREATMENT, THE TRANSFER AGENT FOR THE SHARES SHALL NOTIFY THE CORPORATION IMMEDIATELY. THE REGISTERED HOLDER SHALL HOLD ALL SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION IN THE REGISTERED HOLDER’S NAME (AND NOT IN THE NAME OF ANY NOMINEE) PRIOR TO THIS DATE OR UNTIL TRANSFERRED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.”
