(b) To the extent the Option becomes exercisable, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part (at any time or from time to time, except as otherwise provided herein) until expiration of the Term or earlier termination thereof. 

(c) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Board may, in its discretion and as contemplated by Section 3.3 of the Plan, adopt rules and regulations from time to time after the date hereof with respect to the exercise of the Option and that the exercise by the Grantee of the Option will be subject to the further condition that such exercise is made in accordance with all such rules and regulations as the Board may determine are applicable thereto.

7\. Early Termination of Option. Unless otherwise determined by the Board in its sole discretion, the Option will terminate, prior to the expiration of the Term, at the time specified below: 

(a) Subject to Section 7(b), if the Grantee’s service as a Nonemployee Director terminates other than (i) by the Company for cause or (ii) by reason of death or Disability, then the Option will terminate at the Close of Business on the first Business Day following the expiration of the one-year period which began on the date of termination of the Grantee’s service. For purposes of this Section 7, “cause” will have the meaning specified in Section 10.2(b) of the Plan. 

(b) If the Grantee dies while serving as a Nonemployee Director, or prior to the expiration of a period of time following termination of the Grantee’s service during which the Option remains exercisable as provided in Section 7(a) or Section 7(c), as applicable, the Option will terminate at the Close of Business on the first Business Day following the expiration of the one-year period which began on the date of the Grantee’s death. 

(c) Subject to Section 7(b), if the Grantee’s service as a Nonemployee Director terminates by reason of Disability, then the Option will terminate at the Close of Business on the first Business Day following the expiration of the one-year period which began on the date of termination of the Grantee’s service. 

(d) If the Grantee’s service as a Nonemployee Director is terminated by the Company for “cause” (as defined in Section 10.2(b) of the Plan), then the Option will terminate immediately upon such termination of the Grantee’s service. 

In any event in which the Option remains exercisable for a period of time following the date of termination of the Grantee’s service as a Nonemployee Director as provided above, the Option may be exercised during such period of time only to the extent the Option was 

4 

* * *

##### 

exercisable as provided in Section 3 above on such date of termination of the Grantee’s service as a Nonemployee Director. Notwithstanding any period of time referenced in this Section 7 or any other provision of this Section 7 that may be construed to the contrary, the Option will in any event terminate upon the expiration of the Term. 

8\. Nontransferability. During the Grantee’s lifetime, the Option is not transferable (voluntarily or involuntarily) other than pursuant to a Domestic Relations Order and, except as otherwise required pursuant to a Domestic Relations Order, is exercisable only by the Grantee or the Grantee’s court appointed legal representative. The Grantee may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Option will pass upon the Grantee’s death and may change such designation from time to time by filing a written designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries with the Board on the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B or such other form as may be prescribed by the Board, provided that no such designation will be effective unless so filed prior to the death of the Grantee. If no such designation is made or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the Grantee’s death, the Option will pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Following the Grantee’s death, the Option, if otherwise exercisable, may be exercised by the person to whom such right passes according to the foregoing and such person will be deemed the Grantee for purposes of any applicable provisions of this Agreement. 

9\. No Stockholder Rights. The Grantee will not, by reason of the Option granted under this Agreement, be deemed for any purpose to be, or to have any of the rights of, a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Option Shares, nor will the existence of this Agreement affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to accomplish any corporate act, including, without limitation, the acts referred to in Section 10.15 of the Plan. 

10\. Adjustments. If the outstanding shares of LBTYA are subdivided into a greater number of shares (by stock dividend, stock split, reclassification or otherwise) or are combined into a smaller number of shares (by reverse stock split, reclassification or otherwise), or if the Board determines that any stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase any shares of LBTYA, or other similar corporate event (including mergers or consolidations other than those which constitute Approved Transactions, which shall be governed by Section 10.1(b) of the Plan) affects shares of LBTYA such that an adjustment is required to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Agreement, then the Option will be subject to adjustment (including, without limitation, as to the number of Option Shares and the Exercise Price per share ) in the sole discretion of the Board and in such manner as the Board may deem equitable and appropriate in connection with the occurrence of any of the events described in this Section 10 following the Effective Date. 

11\. Restrictions Imposed by Law. Without limiting the generality of Section 10.7 of the Plan, the Grantee will not exercise the Option, and the Company will not be obligated to make any cash payment or issue or cause to be issued any shares of LBTYA, if counsel to the Company determines that such exercise, payment or issuance would violate any applicable law or any rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any rule or regulation of, or agreement of the Company with, any securities exchange or association upon which shares of LBTYA are listed or quoted. The Company will in no event be obligated to take any affirmative action in
