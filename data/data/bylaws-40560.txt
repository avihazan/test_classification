SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

ONE: The name of this corporation is SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

TWO: The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California other than the banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be incorporated by the California Corporations Code.

THREE: This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The number of shares of Common Stock authorized to be issued is one hundred million (100,000,000) and the number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized to be issued is one million (1,000,000).

The Preferred Stock may be divided into such number of series as the Board of Directors may determine. The Board of Directors is authorized to determine and alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to and imposed upon the Preferred Stock or any series thereof with respect to any wholly unissued class or series of Preferred Stock, and to fix the number of shares of any series of Preferred Stock and the designation of any such series of Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors, within the limits and restrictions stated in any resolution of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series, may increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series.

FOUR: The liability of the directors of this corporation for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under California law.

FIVE: This corporation is authorized to indemnify the directors and officers of this corporation to the fullest extent permissible under California law.

SEVEN: The bylaws shall set forth the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors. Each director shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, no terms in effect prior to the effective date of these Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be shortened.

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, (i) the directors whose terms expire at the 2013 annual meeting of shareholders (or such directors’ successors) shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders; (ii) the directors whose terms expire at the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders (or such directors’ successors) shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders; and (iii) the directors whose terms expire at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders.

1  
  
Subject to any applicable law and the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office though less than a quorum, and directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of office of such director’s predecessor was elected expires. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
