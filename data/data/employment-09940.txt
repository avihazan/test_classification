Employee to Company, enforceable by Company in all respects as if Employee had executed a promissory note or other instrument acknowledging the debt, bearing interest at a rate of 10% per year from the date repayment is due, and payable in full on demand without set-off or deduction.   
  
4. Sick Leave and Disability. Employee will be entitled to sick leave for the number of days determined by Company (“Sick Leave”). Employee will be considered to be disabled during any period in excess of Sick Leave during which Employee is unable to work because of illness or incapacity (“Disability Period”).Employee will be entitled to receive Employee’s full salary during Sick Leave and will be deemed to be on leave, without pay, during the Disability Period. If Employee is unable to work for a period in excess of 90 days, Employee, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of company, will be considered to have resigned. In no event will Employee be entitled to payment or other compensation for unused Sick Leave or Disability Period, unless required by law or otherwise provided in a policy or employment manual adopted by Company.   
  
5. Resignation and Discharge. Employee may resign or be discharged pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. If Employee (i) resigns, Employee must give 30 days’ notice to Company; (ii) is discharged for cause (as later defined), Company may discharge Employee immediately, without notice; or (iii) is discharged not for cause from his responsibilities, Company must give 30 days’ notice to Employee. If Employee is discharged not for cause, Employee will be paid (a) if such discharge occurs in connection with or within one year after a change in control of the Company, severance pay equal to one year’s base pay of Employee in effect at the time of discharge payable in a single lump sum, or (b) if such discharge occurs at any other time, severance pay equal to six months’ base pay of Employee in effect at the time of discharge payable in monthly installments.

For purposes of this paragraph, “for cause” means that during the Employment Period, Employee, unless otherwise provided by Company policy or Company employment manual, (a) is reasonably believed by Company (i) to have failed to comply with any law, regulation or policy, including without limitation securities or employment or non-discrimination or similar laws, regulations or policies, and that failure causes a significant financial, regulatory, operational or public perception

E. Remedies. Employee and Company recognize that irreparable injury may result to Company in the event of breach or threatened breach of this paragraph of this Agreement by Employee. If Employee commits a breach or threatens to commit a breach of any of the provisions of this paragraph, Company shall have the right and remedy, in addition to any others that may be available, at law or in equity, to have the provisions of this paragraph specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, together with an accounting therefor, Employee having specifically acknowledged that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Company and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Company.   
  
7. Invalidity. If any provision of this Employment Agreement is later construed to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions shall not be affected but shall continue in full effect. If any term of this Employment Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid by any court having jurisdiction, that court shall have the power to reduce or revise the term and the paragraph(s) shall then be fully enforceable.   
  
8. Assignment. Employee acknowledges that Employee’s services are unique and personal. Accordingly, Employee may not assign Employee’s rights or delegate Employee’s duties or obligations under this Agreement. The Employer’s rights and obligations shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon Employer’s successor and assigns.

Company reserves the right to revise the personnel policies from time to time, as Company deems necessary. If any personnel policy provision conflicts with a provision of this Employment Agreement, the terms of this Employment Agreement shall govern.
