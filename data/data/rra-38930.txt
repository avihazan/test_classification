(b) In the event of a registration of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact which was made in conformity with information furnished in writing by the Purchaser to the Company specifically for use in (and such information is contained in) the registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such person for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any person or entity in excess of the amount of the aggregate proceeds received by the Purchaser of Registrable Securities in connection with any such registration under the Securities Act. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party other than under this Section 5(c) and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under this Section 5(c) if and to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such omission.

5 

* * *

person of the Purchaser, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5(c) but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 5(c) provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of the Purchaser or controlling person of the Purchaser in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 5(c); then, and in each such case, the Company and the Purchaser will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that the Purchaser is responsible only for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its securities offered by the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such registration statement, provided, however, that, in any such case, (A) the Purchaser will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such securities offered by it pursuant to such registration statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised in writing (the “Advice”) by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The Company may provide appropriate stop-transfer orders to enforce the provisions of this paragraph.

(e) Piggy-Back Registrations. If at any time during the Effectiveness Period there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each Holder written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days after receipt of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such holder requests to be registered, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights and subject to the consent of any selling stockholder(s) under such registration statement.
