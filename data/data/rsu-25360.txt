TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF 

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT

  
  
  
AWARD AGREEMENT

  


These terms and conditions are made part of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the “Award Agreement”) dated as of [____________________] (“Grant Date”) awarding shares of restricted stock pursuant to the terms of the Computer Programs and Systems, Inc. 2005 Restricted Stock Plan (as amended and restated, “Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the terms of the Award Agreement will govern. 

  


Capitalized terms that are not defined in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan. 

  


Computer Programs and Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries will be referred to collectively throughout this Award Agreement as the “Company.”

  
  
  
VESTING SCHEDULE

  


This award will vest according to the schedule set forth on your Award Agreement, provided that you are continuously employed by the Company through the relevant vesting date or you meet the requirement for continued vesting described below. 

  
  
  
ACCELERATED VESTING

  


Restricted Stock shall automatically become vested in full if any of the following events occur:

  


▪ The Company is subject to a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan); or

▪ You die while you are employed by the Company; or

▪ Your employment or affiliation with the Company terminates by reason of a Disability (as defined in the Plan).

  


Upon vesting of the Restricted Stock, the shares shall no longer be subject to transfer restrictions other than such restrictions as may be imposed by law over which the Company has no control.

  
  
  
TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

  


The Restricted Stock may not be transferred, sold, exchanged, pledged or otherwise disposed of prior to vesting other than in the limited situations discussed in the Plan.

FORFEITURE

  


If, prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock, your employment or affiliation with the Company is terminated for any reason (other than as set forth under “Accelerated Vesting” above, or “Termination Without Cause” below), or if you retire from active employment with the Company, then you shall, for no consideration, forfeit to the Company all of the Restricted Stock that has not yet vested in accordance with this Award Agreement.

  
  
  
TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE

If your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Plan), then you shall, for no consideration, forfeit to the Company all of the Restricted Stock that has not yet vested in accordance with this Award Agreement; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may determine, in its sole discretion, at the time of your termination, to accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock.

  
  
  
VOTING AND DIVIDEND RIGHTS

  


  


A certificate(s) evidencing the Restricted Stock (the “Certificate”) shall be issued by the Company in your name pursuant to which you will have voting rights and shall be entitled to receive dividends (if any) unless and until the Restricted Stock is forfeited pursuant to the provisions of this Award Agreement.

  
  
  
STOCK CERTIFICATES AND LEGENDS

The Certificate shall bear a legend evidencing the nature of the Restricted Stock. Upon the lapse of the transfer restrictions without forfeiture, the Company shall cause a new certificate or certificates to be issued without such legend in your name for the Restricted Stock upon which the transfer restrictions lapsed. 

  
  
  
ESCROW AND STOCK POWER

  


To facilitate the enforcement of the transfer restrictions set forth in the preceding paragraphs and in the Plan, the Company may cause the Certificate to be delivered to a designated escrow agent (which may, but need not be, the Company) until a forfeiture occurs or the transfer restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.

  


The Company may also require you to deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Stock then subject to transfer restrictions. 

  
  
  
TERM

This Award Agreement terminates when all Restricted Stock is either vested or forfeited as provided in the Plan or this Award Agreement.

  
  
  
WITHHOLDING TAXES AND 

STOCK WITHHOLDING

  


You will be required to deliver to the Company at the time of vesting such amount of money or shares of unrestricted Stock as the Company may require to meet its withholding obligation under applicable tax laws and regulations, and if you fail to do so, the Company is authorized to withhold from any cash or stock remuneration then or thereafter payable to you any tax required to be withheld.
