10\. Right of Offset. In the event the Company shall terminate this Agreement other than for cause, as defined by this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to offset any remaining salary due to Employee pursuant to Paragraph 9B hereof against any compensation received by Employee during the period the Company is required to continue payments to Employee hereunder. In the event the Company shall determine that the compensation received by Employee for such subsequent employment is below a rate reasonable for such employment, the Company shall instead be entitled to offset compensation still owing to Employee against such reasonable rate. This provision shall survive such termination. 

11\. Confidential Information. 

A. Company Information. Employee hereby covenants and agrees at all times during the Term and thereafter to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose to any person, firm or corporation without written authorization of the Company’s Board of Directors, any of the Company’s Confidential

Employee hereby agrees that he will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, any Prior Invention owned by Employee or in which Employee has an interest into a Company product, process or service without the Company’s prior written consent.

If the Company is unable because of Employee’s mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason to secure Employee’s signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering any Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Company as above, then Employee hereby irrevocably designates and

appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee’s agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in Employee’s behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Employee. 

13\. Solicitation of Employees. Employee hereby agrees that for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee’s relationship with the Company for any reason (whether with or without cause, at the option either of the Company or Employee, with or without notice), Employee will not, either directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees to leave their employment or contractors to terminate their relationship with the Company, or hire or take away such employees or contractors, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage, hire or take away employees or contractors of the Company, either for himself or for any other person or entity. 

14\. Interference. Employee hereby agrees that during the course of Employee’s employment and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee’s relationship with the Company for any reason (whether with or without cause, at the option either of the Company or Employee, with or without notice), Employee will not, either directly or indirectly, interfere with the Company’s relationships with any of its customers or clients whom Employee served or whose names became known to Employee during the course of Employee’s employment (“Covered Clients or Customers”).

15\. Covenant Not to Compete.

A. Employee hereby covenants and agrees that during the Term and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee’s relationship with the Company for any reason (whether with or without cause, at the option either of the Company or Employee, with or without notice), Employee will not without the Company’s prior written consent, either directly or indirectly, (i) serve in any capacity that could require Employee to use any of the Confidential Information, goodwill or training that Employee received or had access to during Employee’s employment with the Company, including, as an advisor, agent, supervisor, consultant, contractor, director, employee, officer, partner, proprietor or otherwise of, (ii) have any ownership interest in (except for passive ownership of one percent (1%) or less of any entity whose securities have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or (iii) participate in the organization, financing, operation, management or control of, any business in competition with the Company’s business as conducted by the Company during the course of Employee’s employment with the Company (including any customer of the Company). The foregoing covenant shall cover Employee’s activities in every part of the Territory (as defined herein). “Territory” shall mean (i) all counties in the State of Texas, (ii) all other states of the United States of America and (iii) all other countries of the world; provided that, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), the Company either (1) derives at least five percent (5%) of its gross revenues from such geographic area prior to the date of the termination of Employee’s relationship with the Company or (2) has active plans for the introduction of such product or services in such geographic area within six (6) months of the date of the termination of Employee’s relationship with the Company. Employee stipulates that the foregoing is a reasonable geographic area because of the scope of the Company’s operations and Employee’s activities, and that this paragraph creates a narrowly tailored advance approval requirement in order to avoid unfair competition and irreparable harm to Company and is not intended or to be construed as a general restraint from engaging in a lawful profession or a general covenant against competition. Further, Employee hereby agrees that Employee may not avoid the purpose and intent of this paragraph by engaging in conduct within the geographically limited area from a remote location through means such as telecommunications, written correspondence, computer generated or assisted communications, or other similar methods.

B. Employee hereby understands and acknowledges that Employee’s fulfillment of the obligations contained in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Employee’s obligation neither to use, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose the Company’s Confidential Information and Employee’s obligation not to compete contained in Paragraph 15.A. above is necessary to protect the Company’s Confidential Information and to preserve the Company’s value and goodwill. Employee hereby further acknowledges the time, geographic and scope limitations of Employee’s obligations under Paragraph 15.A. above are reasonable, especially in light of the Company’s desire to protect its Confidential Information, and that Employee will not be precluded from gainful employment if Employee is obligated not to compete with the Company during the period and within the Territory as described above. 

C. The covenants contained in Paragraph 15.A. above shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each city, county and state of any geographic area in the Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant contained in Paragraph 15.A. above. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of such separate covenants (or any part thereof), then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event the provisions of Paragraph 15.A. above are deemed to exceed the time, geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, then permitted by such law. 

16\.

Further, the existence of any claim or cause of action by Employee against Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to enforcement by Company of such provisions or restrictions, and in the event an enforcement remedy is sought for Employee’s violation of any of those provisions or restrictions, the time periods provided for in such paragraphs, if any, shall be extended by one day for each day Employee failed to comply with the provision or restriction at issue. 

18\. Standards. Employee shall comply with the Company’s policies for its employees as adopted from time to time and shall act at all times with due regard to public convention and morals, and shall refrain from engaging in conduct, committing any act or becoming involved in any situation or occurrence that will bring Employee into public disrepute, scandal, contempt or ridicule or which prejudices or is detrimental to the Company, its owners or employees.

Any such liability or obligation shall come solely from the assets of the Company, and no owner, partner, shareholder, officer, employee or director of the Company shall be individually or personally liable for any claim, liability or obligations arising under this Agreement or arising out of Employee’s employment.
