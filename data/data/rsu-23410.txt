Exhibit 99.4

GSI TECHNOLOGY, INC.



(For Non-U.S. Participant)

GSI Technology, Inc. has granted to the Participant named in the Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the “Grant Notice”) to which this Stock Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) is attached an option (the “Option”) to purchase certain shares of Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice and this Option Agreement. The Option has been granted pursuant to and shall in all respects be subject to the terms and conditions of the GSI Technology, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as amended to the Date of Grant, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. By signing the Grant Notice, the Participant: (a) acknowledges receipt of and represents that the Participant has read and is familiar with the Grant Notice, this Option Agreement, the Plan and a prospectus for the Plan prepared in connection with the registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission of shares issuable pursuant to the Option (the “Plan Prospectus”), (b) accepts the Option subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Grant Notice, this Option Agreement and the Plan and (c) agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Grant Notice, this Option Agreement or the Plan.

1\. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.

1.1 Definitions. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Grant Notice or the Plan.

1.2 Construction. Captions and titles contained herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Option Agreement. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. Use of the term “or” is not intended to be exclusive, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

2\. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OPTION.

2.1 Compliance with Local Law. The Participant agrees that the Participant will not acquire shares pursuant to the Option or transfer, assign, sell or otherwise deal with such shares except in compliance with Local Law.

2.2 Employment Conditions. In accepting the Option, the Participant acknowledges that:

(a) Any notice period mandated under Local Law shall not be treated as Service for the purpose of determining the vesting of the Option; and the Participant’s right to exercise the Option after termination of Service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of the Participant’s active Service and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under Local Law. Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the Plan, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether the Participant’s Service has terminated and the effective date of such termination.

  


* * *

  


(b) The Plan is established voluntarily by the Company. It is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Option Agreement.

(c) The grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Options, or benefits in lieu of Options, even if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past.

(d) All decisions with respect to future Option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company.

(e) The Participant’s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further Service with any Participating Company and shall not interfere with the ability of any Participating Company to terminate the Participant’s Service at any time, with or without cause.

(f) The Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan.

(g) The Option is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for Service of any kind rendered to any Participating Company, and which is outside the scope of the Participant’s employment contract, if any.

(h) The Option is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments.

(i) In the event that the Participant is not an employee of the Company, the Option grant will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company; and furthermore the Option grant will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with any other Participating Company.

(j) The future value of the underlying shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. If the underlying shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value. If the Participant exercises the Option and obtains shares, the value of those shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price.

### (k) No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from termination of the Option or diminution in value of the Option or shares purchased through exercise of the Option resulting from termination of the Participant’s Service (for any reason whether or not in breach of Local Law) and the Participant irrevocably releases the Company and each other Participating Company from any such claim that may arise. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen then, by signing this Option Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived the Participant’s entitlement to pursue such a claim.

## 2.3 Data Privacy Consent.

### (a) The Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant’s personal data as described in this document by and among the members of the Participating Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan.

### (b) The Participant understands that the Participating Company Group holds certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (“Data”). The Participant understands that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in the Participant’s country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant’s country. The Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Participant’s local human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant’s participation in the Plan. The Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Participant’s local human resources representative. The Participant understands, however, that refusing or withdrawing the Participant’s consent may affect the Participant’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of the Participant’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant understands that he or she may contact the Participant’s local human resources representative.

# 3\. ADMINISTRATION.

All questions of interpretation concerning this Option Agreement shall be determined by the Committee. All determinations by the Committee shall be final and binding upon all persons having an interest in the Option as provided by the Plan. Any Officer shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Company with respect to any matter, right, obligation, or election which is the responsibility of or which is allocated to the Company herein, provided the Officer has apparent authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, or election.

4\. EXERCISE OF THE OPTION.

4.1 Right to Exercise. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Option shall be exercisable on and after the Initial Vesting Date and prior to the termination of the Option (as provided in Section 6) in an amount not to exceed the number of Vested Shares less the number of shares previously acquired upon exercise of the Option. In no event shall the Option be exercisable for more shares than the Number of Option Shares, as adjusted pursuant to Section 9.

4.2 Method of Exercise. Exercise of the Option shall be by means of electronic or written notice (the “Exercise Notice”) in a form authorized by the Company. An electronic Exercise Notice must be digitally signed or authenticated by the Participant in such manner as required by the notice and transmitted to the Company or an authorized representative of the Company (including a third-party administrator designated by the Company). In the event that the Participant is not authorized or is unable to provide an electronic Exercise Notice, the Option shall be exercised by a written Exercise Notice addressed to the Company, which shall be signed by the Participant and delivered in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by confirmed facsimile transmission, or by such other means as the Company may permit, to the Company, or an authorized representative of the Company (including a third-party administrator designated by the Company). Each Exercise Notice, whether electronic or written, must state the Participant’s election to exercise the Option, the number of whole shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised and such other representations and agreements as to the Participant’s investment intent with respect to such shares as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Option Agreement. Further, each Exercise Notice must be received by the Company prior to the termination of the Option as set forth in Section 6 and must be accompanied by full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased. The Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such electronic or written Exercise Notice and the aggregate Exercise Price.

4.3 Payment of Exercise Price.

(a) Forms of Consideration Authorized. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised shall be made (i) in cash or by check or cash equivalent, (ii) if permitted by the Company, by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of whole shares of Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value not less than the aggregate Exercise Price, (iii) by means of a Cashless Exercise, as defined in Section 4.3(b), or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Limitations on Forms of Consideration.

(i) Tender of Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock. If required by the Company, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months or such other period, if any, required by the Company (and not used for 

4

  


* * *

  


another option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.

(ii) Cashless Exercise. A “Cashless Exercise” means the delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker in a form acceptable to the Company providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the Option pursuant to a program or procedure approved by the Company (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any such program or procedure, including with respect to the Participant notwithstanding that such program or procedures may be available to others.

4.4 Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action taken by the Company or any other Participating Company with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (the “Tax Obligations”), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and that the Company (a) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to such exercise, or the receipt of any dividends and (b) does not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any other aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax Obligations. At the time of exercise of the Option, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and any other Participating Company. In this regard, at the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company or any other Participating Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding of all applicable Tax Obligations from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for withholding of all applicable Tax Obligations, if any, by each Participating Company which arise in connection with the Option. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under applicable law, including Local Law, the Company or any other Participating Company may (i) sell or arrange for the sale of shares acquired by the Participant to satisfy the Tax Obligations, and/or (ii) withhold in shares, provided that only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount required by applicable law, including Local Law, is withheld. Finally, the Participant shall pay to the Company or any other Participating Company any amount of the Tax Obligations that any such company may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company shall have no obligation to process the exercise of the Option or to deliver shares until the Tax Obligations as described in this Section have been satisfied by the Participant.

4.5 Beneficial Ownership of Shares; Certificate Registration. The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice any or all shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option. Except as provided by the preceding sentence, a certificate for the shares as to which the 

5

  


* * *

  


Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant.

## 4.6 Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of Shares. The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of United States federal or state or Local Law with respect to such securities. The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, including Local Law, or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. THE PARTICIPANT IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTICIPANT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

## 4.7 Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise of the Option.

# 5\. NONTRANSFERABILITY OF THE OPTION.

During the lifetime of the Participant, the Option shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative. The Option shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Following the death of the Participant, the Option, to the extent provided in Section 7, may be exercised by the Participant’s legal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Participant’s will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.

# 6\. TERMINATION OF THE OPTION.

The Option shall terminate and may no longer be exercised after the first to occur of (a) the close of business on the Option Expiration Date, (b) the close of business on the last date for exercising the Option following termination of the Participant’s Service as described in Section 7, or (c) a Change in Control to the extent provided in Section 8.

* * *

  


7\. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE.

7.1 Option Exercisability. The Option shall terminate immediately upon the Participant’s termination of Service to the extent that it is then unvested and shall be exercisable after the Participant’s termination of Service to the extent it is then vested only during the applicable time period as determined below and thereafter shall terminate.

(a) Disability. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Disability of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for Vested Shares on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

(b) Death. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for Vested Shares on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Participant’s death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. The Participant’s Service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Participant dies within three (3) months after the Participant’s termination of Service.

(c) Termination for Cause. If the Participant’s Service is terminated for Cause or if, following the Participant’s termination of Service and during any period in which the Option otherwise would remain exercisable, the Participant engages in any act that would constitute Cause, the Option shall terminate in its entirety and cease to be exercisable immediately upon such termination of Service or act.

(d) Other Termination of Service. If the Participant’s Service terminates for any reason, except Disability, death or Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for Vested Shares by the Participant on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

7.2 Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law or Insider Trading Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than termination of Service for Cause, if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 7.1 is prevented by the provisions of Section 4.6 or a sale of shares pursuant to a Cashless Exercise of the Option would violate the provisions of the Insider Trading Policy, the Option shall remain exercisable until thirty (30) days after the date such exercise or sale, as the case may be, would no longer be prevented by such provisions, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

8\. EFFECT OF CHANGE IN CONTROL.

In the event of a Change in Control, except to the extent that the Committee determines to cash out the Option in accordance with Section 15.1(c) of the Plan, the surviving, 

7

  


* * *

  


continuing, successor, or purchasing entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror”), may, without the consent of the Participant, assume or continue in full force and effect the Company’s rights and obligations under all or any portion of the Option or substitute for all or any portion of the Option a substantially equivalent option for the Acquiror’s stock. For purposes of this Section, the Option or any portion thereof shall be deemed assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Option confers the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, for each share of Stock subject to such portion of the Option immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, other securities or property or a combination thereof) to which a holder of a share of Stock on the effective date of the Change in Control was entitled; provided, however, that if such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiror, the Committee may, with the consent of the Acquiror, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option, for each share of Stock subject to the Option, to consist solely of common stock of the Acquiror equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control. The Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control to the extent that the Option is neither assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control.

# 9\. ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number, Exercise Price and kind of shares subject to the Option, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights under the Option. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and the Exercise Price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In no event may the Exercise Price be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Option. The Committee in its sole discretion, may also make such adjustments in the terms of the Option to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate. All adjustments pursuant to this Section shall be determined by the Committee, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.

# 10\. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT.

The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the Option until the date of the issuance of the shares for which the Option has been exercised (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, 

8

  


* * *

  


distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the shares are issued, except as provided in Section 9. If the Participant is an Employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant’s employment is “at will” and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Participant’s Service as a Director, an Employee or Consultant, as the case may be, at any time.

# 11\. LEGENDS.

The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law, including Local Law, restrictions on all certificates representing shares of stock subject to the provisions of this Option Agreement. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to the Option in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, legends placed on such certificates may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

# 12\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

## 12.1 Termination or Amendment. The Committee may terminate or amend the Plan or the Option at any time; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 8 in connection with a Change in Control, no such termination or amendment may adversely affect the Option or any unexercised portion hereof without the consent of the Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with any applicable law or government regulation. No amendment or addition to this Option Agreement shall be effective unless in writing.

## 12.2 Further Instruments. The parties hereto agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may reasonably be necessary to carry out the intent of this Option Agreement.

## 12.3 Binding Effect. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth herein, this Option Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

## 12.4 Delivery of Documents and Notices. Any document relating to participation in the Plan or any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (except to the extent that this Option Agreement provides for effectiveness only upon actual receipt of such notice) upon personal delivery, electronic delivery at the e-mail address, if any, provided for the Participant by a Participating Company, or upon deposit in the U.S. Post Office or foreign postal service, by registered or certified mail, or with a nationally recognized overnight courier service, with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address of such party set forth in the Grant Notice or at such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other party.
