Upon any termination under this Section 4(c), Employee shall be entitled only to compensation earned through the final day of Employee's active employment and, thereafter, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder.

(d) Death or Permanent Disability. Subject to the Company's obligations and Employee's rights under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, if applicable, and any other applicable federal or state laws, this Agreement and Employee's employment hereunder shall terminate automatically upon Employee's death or permanent disability. Upon any termination under this Section 4(d), Employee or his estate, as appropriate, shall be entitled to receive any compensation Employee shall have earned prior to the date of termination but which remains unpaid. Permanent disability for purposes of this Agreement shall mean a physical or mental condition of Employee which renders Employee incapable of performing his normal and regular employment duties and which condition shall be medically determined to be of permanent duration as defined by the Company's group disability policy (or, if no such policy is in effect, as defined by the Company). Employee agrees to submit to such medical examinations as may be requested by the Company or the Company's disability insurer with regard to the issue of disability of Employee.

The foregoing obligation of confidentiality and nondisclosure shall not apply when:

(i) Public Domain. The Information was in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Employee, or at any time after disclosure has become a part of the public domain by publication or otherwise through sources other than Employee, directly or indirectly, and without fault on the part of Employee in failing to keep such Information confidential;

(ii) Requirement of Law or Order. Disclosure is required by law or court order, provided Employee gives the Company prior written notice of any such disclosure so that the Company may seek to contest such disclosure or seek a protective order;

(iii) Agreement. Disclosure is made with the prior written agreement of the senior management of the Company; or,

(iv) Third Party Disclosure. The Information is lawfully disclosed to Employee after the termination of Employee's employment by a third party who is under no obligation of confidentiality to the Company with respect to such Information.

7\. Records. All notes, data, tapes, reference materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, models, records, any other documentation in any way relating to any of the information referred to in Sections 5 and 6 hereof (including without limitation, any Information) or to the Company's Business shall belong exclusively to the Company, and Employee agrees to turn over to the Company all such materials and all copies of such materials in Employee's possession or then under Employee's control at the request of the Company or, in the absence of such request, upon the termination of Employee's employment with the Company.

8\. Reasonableness and Enforceability. EMPLOYEE HAS READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT EMPLOYEE'S OWN LEGAL COUNSEL TO ADVISE EMPLOYEE REGARDING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE NOW AGREES THAT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANYโS STOCKHOLDERS. EMPLOYEE FURTHER AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYEE TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE LIVING. The provisions of this Agreement shall be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against the Company whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise.

9\. Arbitration.  Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with any provision of this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitration committee applying the laws of North Carolina whose decision shall be binding on the parties without further action or recourse. The parties agree that the arbitration committee shall be comprised of three (3) individuals, each of whom shall be a resident of the State of North Carolina. Each party shall name one (1) person to serve on the arbitration committee, and the two (2) persons so selected shall choose a third person to serve on the committee. The decision of any two (2) members of the committee shall be the decision of the committee. In the event that the members of the arbitration committee for any reason are not chosen within thirty (30) days from the date a party hereto gives notice of claim for arbitration, any party hereto thereafter shall have the right to apply to an appropriate court for the appointment by the court, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 1-569.11, to the committee of three (3) qualified and disinterested arbitrators. To assist the committee in its function as arbitrator, the committee may engage an attorney, certified public accountant, and any other person to be of assistance in the arbitration of any matter before the committee. The expenses of the committee, including those of persons engaged to be of assistance to the committee, shall be shared by the parties in proportions to be determined by the arbitration committee. The arbitration award shall not include punitive damages, factual findings, or conclusions of law, but such arbitration award may include attorney fees in an amount determined by the arbitration committee. Any award rendered by the arbitration committee shall be final and binding and judgment may be entered upon it in any North Carolina court of competent jurisdiction. Except as herein provided, the provisions of Article 45C of Chapter 1 of the North Carolina General Statutes shall apply in arbitration proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for preliminary or interim equitable relief, or to compel arbitration in accordance with this section, without breach of this arbitration provision.

10\. Specific Enforcement; Damages; Attorneys' Fees. Employee acknowledges that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by Employee of the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate to protect the Company against the consequences of such breach, and Employee therefore agrees that (a) the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach without posting any bond, and (b) Employee shall account for and pay over to the Company all monetary damages suffered by the Company as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Employee further agrees that in the event he breaches this Agreement, Employee shall pay all reasonable attorneys' fees allowed by law incurred by the Company in enforcing the terms of this Agreement and in seeking damages for its breach, or both, together with all court costs.

11\. Waiver. The failure of any party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or of the right of such party thereafter to enforce any such provisions. Waiver by any party hereto of any breach or default by the other parties of any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any other breach or default, whether similar to or different from the breach or default waived.

12\. Successor Employers. Employee hereby authorizes the Company to provide a copy of this Agreement to any and all future employers, and to notify any and all future employers that the Company intends to exercise its legal rights arising out of or in conjunction with this Agreement and/or any breach or any inducement of breach of it.

13\. Reformation/Severability of Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbiter to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement but shall be confined in its operation to the provision of this Agreement directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be reformed so that each party shall have the obligation to perform reasonably alternatively to give the other party the benefit of its bargain. In the event the invalid or unenforceable provision cannot be reformed, the other provisions or applications of this Agreement shall be given full effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed struck.

14\. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and Employee, their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, principals, members, managers, directors, officers, successors and assigns, heirs, legatees, executors, administrators, and personal representatives, as applicable; provided, however, that the agreements of Employee are personal to Employee, and Employee shall not assign Employee's obligations, responsibilities, and benefits hereunder. The Company shall have the right to assign its obligations, responsibilities, or benefits hereunder.

15\. Governing Law; Venue; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction. This Agreement is executed in the State of North Carolina, and Employee agrees that without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, the internal laws of the State of North Carolina shall govern and control the validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement. Any lawsuit brought under the terms of this Agreement shall have exclusive venue in the state and federal courts of Wake County, North Carolina; provided, however, that with respect to any proceeding for injunctive relief the Company may, at its option, bring the proceeding before a court where Employee resides at the time of such proceeding. Employee hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

16\. Notice. Any notice required hereunder shall be deemed sufficient and service thereof completed upon receipt, refusal, or nondelivery of same if same shall be in writing and hand-delivered or addressed to the addressee at the last known post office address thereof, in the case of Employee, or the registered office of the Company, in the case of the Company, and mailed certified or registered mail, with return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

17\. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understandings by and between the Company and Employee with respect to the covenants herein described, and no representations, promises, agreements, or understandings, written or oral, not herein contained shall be of any force or effect. No change or modification hereof shall be valid or binding unless the same is in writing and signed by the parties hereto. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same is in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced; moreover, no valid waiver of any other provision of this Agreement at any time shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement at such time nor will it be deemed a valid waiver of such provision at any other time.

18\. Section Headings. The section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not be construed as terms of this Agreement.

19\. Survival of Covenants. The provisions set forth in Sections 4 through 19 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive termination of Employee's employment with the Company.
