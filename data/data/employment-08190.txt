(g) Limitation. The terms of this Section 8 are intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If the duration, scope, or

5

* * *

  


nature of any limitation or restriction imposed by any provision of this Section 8 is finally determined by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be in excess of what is valid and enforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, scope or activity that is valid and enforceable. Executive hereby acknowledges that this Section 8 shall be given the construction which renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent, not exceeding its express terms, possible under applicable law

(c) Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the employment of Executive by the Employer.

Each party has been provided ample time and opportunity to review and negotiate the terms of this Agreement and consult with legal counsel regarding the Agreement.

(e) No Waiver. The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered a waiver of such party’s rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.

* * *

  


(f) Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

Regardless of whether such an agreement is executed, this Agreement shall be binding upon any successor of the Employer and such successor shall be deemed the “Employer” for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Executive shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if Employer’s assets or membership units are sold to an entity that is not a subsidiary or an affiliate of the Employer. Such a sale shall include a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or membership units or other corporate reorganization; however it shall not include a change in ownership as a result of a public offering.
