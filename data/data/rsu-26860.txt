If designated in Section 1 as an Incentive Stock Option, this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option as defined in Section 422 of the Code. However, if this Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section 422(d) it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.

  


(b)

Exercise of Option. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Exercise Schedule set out in Section 1 and with the provisions of of the Plan as follows:

  


(c)

Right to Exercise.

(iii)

In no event may this Option be exercised after the date of expiration of the term of this Option as set forth in Section 1.

  


(d)

Method of Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable by written notice (in the form attached as Exhibit A) which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, and such other representations and agreements as to the holder's investment intent with respect to such shares of Common Stock as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. Such written notice shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be delivered in person or by certified mail to the Secretary of the Company. The written notice shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such written notice accompanied by the Exercise Price.

  


No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such issuance and such exercise shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to such Shares.

  


3\. OPTIONEE'S REPRESENTATIONS. In the event the Shares purchasable pursuant to the exercise of this Option have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), at the time this Option is exercised, Optionee shall, if required by the Company, concurrently with the exercise of all or any portion of this Option, deliver to the Company his Investment Representation Statement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

(d)

delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to the Company of the sale or loan pro­ceeds required to pay the exercise price.

  


5\. RESTRICTIONS ON EXERCISE. This Option may not be exercised until such time as the Plan has been approved by the shareholders of the Company, or if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities or other law or regulation, including any rule under Part 207 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations ("Regulation G") as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board. As a condition to the exercise of this Option, the Company may require Optionee to make any representation and warranty to the Company as may be required by any applicable law or regulation.

  


6\.  TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP. In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates, Optionee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at the date of such termination (the "Termination Date"), exercise this Option during the 90-day Termination Period set out in Section 1. To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise this Option at the date of such termination, or if Optionee does not exercise this Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.

  


.

7\. DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's consulting relationship or Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of his or her disability, Optionee may, but only within 180 days from the date of such termination (and in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in this Option Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination; provided, however, that if such disability is not a "disability" as such term is defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option such Incentive Stock Option shall automatically convert to a Nonstatutory Stock Option on the day three months and one day following such termination. To the extent th at Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

  


8\. DEATH OF OPTIONEE. In the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of the death of Optionee, the Option may be exercised at any time within 180 days following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of this Option as set forth in Section 10 below), by Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the Optionee could exercise the Option at the date of death.

  


9\. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by him. The terms of this Option shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.

  


.

10. TERM OF OPTION. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in Section 1, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option. The limitations set forth in the Plan regarding Options designated as Incentive Stock Options and Options granted to more than ten percent (10%) shareholders shall apply to this Option.

  


11 TAXATION UPON EXERCISE OF OPTION. Optionee understands that, upon exercising a nonstatutory Option, he or she will recognize income for tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares over the exercise price. However, the timing of this income recognition may be deferred for up to six months if Optionee is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). If the Optionee is an employee, the Company will be required to withhold from Optionee's compensation, or collect from Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount equal to a percentage of this compensation income. Additionally, the Optionee may at some point be required to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the disqualifying disposition of an Incentive Sto ck Option. The Optionee shall satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation arising upon the exercise of this Option out of Optionee's compensation or by payment to the Company.

  


.

12 "MARKET STAND-OFF" AGREEMENT. Optionee hereby agrees, if requested by the Company and an underwriter of Common Stock (or other equity securities) of the Company, not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Common Stock (or other equity securities) of the Company held by the Optionee during the 180 day period following the date of a final prospectus of the Company, filed under the 1993 Act. The Company may impose "stop transfer" instructions with respect to any shares held by Optionee subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of such 180 day period.

  


.

13 TAX CONSEQUENCES. Set forth below is a brief summary as of the date of this Option of some of the federal and state tax consequences of exercise of this Option and disposition of the Shares. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

  


(a)

Exercise of ISO. If this Option qualifies as an ISO, there will be no regular federal income tax liability or state income tax liability upon the exercise of the Option, although the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to the alternative minimum tax for federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to the alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise.

  


(b)

Exercise of ISO following Disability. If the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of disability that is not total and permanent disability as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, to the extent permitted on the date of termination, the Optionee must exercise an ISO within 90 days of such termination for the ISO to be qualified as an ISO. 

  


(c)

Exercise of Nonstatutory Stock Option. There may be a regular federal income tax liability and state income tax liability upon the exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price. If Optionee is an employee, the Company will be required to withhold from Optionee's compensation or collect from Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount equal to a percentage of this compensation income at the time of exercise.

  


(d)

Disposition of Shares. In the case of an ISO, if Shares are held for at least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal and state income tax purposes. In the case of an ISO, if Shares transferred pursuant to the Option are held for at least one year after exercise and are disposed of at least two years after the Date of Grant, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will also be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. If Shares purchased under an ISO are disposed of within such one-year period or within two years after the Date of Grant, any gain realized on such disposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates) to the extent of the difference between the Exercise Price and the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise, or (2) the sale price of the Shares.

  


(e)

Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. If the Option granted to Optionee herein is an ISO, and if Optionee sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to the ISO on or before the later of (1) the date two years after the Date of Grant, or (2) the date one year after the date of exercise, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. Optionee agrees that Optionee may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income recognized by the Optionee.

In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Company the following:

  


(a)

Optionee is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the securities. Optionee is acquiring these securities for investment for Optionee's own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").

  


(b)

Optionee acknowledges and understands that the securities constitute "restricted securities" under the 1933 Act and have not been registered under the 1933 Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Optionee's investment intent as expressed herein. In this connection, Optionee understands that, in the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if Optionee's representation was predicated solely upon a present intention to hold these Securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the market price of the Securities, or for a period of one year or any other fixed period in the future. Optionee further understands th at the Securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the 1933 Act or an exemption from such regis­tration is available. Optionee further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the securities. Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing the securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such regis­tra­tion is not required under federal and applicable state securities laws, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company.

  


  


48437.1

  


  


(c)

Optionee is familiar with the provisions of Rule 701 and Rule 144, each promulgated under the 1933 Act, which, in substance, permit limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly from the issuer thereof, in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain condi­tions. Rule 701 provides that if the issuer qualifies under Rule 701 at the time of the grant of the Option to the Optionee, the exercise will be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. In the event the Company becomes subject to the report­ing requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ninety (90) days thereafter (or such longer period as any market stand-off agreement may require) the securities exempt under Rule 701 may be resold, subject to the satisfaction of cert ain of the conditions specified by Rule 144, including: (1) the resale being made through a broker in an unsolicited "broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a market maker (as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and, in the case of an affiliate, (2) the availability of certain public information about the Company, (3) the amount of securities being sold during any three month period not exceeding the limitations specified in Rule 144(e), and (4) the timely filing of a Form 144, if applicable.

  


In the event that the Company does not qualify under Rule 701 at the time of grant of the Option, then the securities may be resold in certain limited circumstances subject to the provisions of Rule 144, which requires the resale to occur not less than two years after the party has pur­chased, and made full payment for, within the meaning of Rule 144, the securities to be sold; and, in the case of an affiliate, or of a non-affiliate who has held the securities less than three years, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in sections (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the paragraph immediately above.

  


(d)

Optionee further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 701 or 144 are not satis­fied, registration under the 1933 Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rules 144 and 701 are not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rules 144 or 701 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that any such other regis­tra­ ;tion exemption will be available in such event.
