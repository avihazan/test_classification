* * *

  


(a) 

The Company agrees that if Stroud is made a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether or not the basis of such Proceeding is Stroud’s alleged action in an official capacity while serving as a director, officer, member, employee or agent, Stroud shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or, if greater, by the laws of the State of Colorado, against all cost, expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by Stroud in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to Stroud even if he has ceased to be a director, member, employee or agent of the Company or other entity and shall inure to the benefit of Stroud’s heirs, executors and administrators. The Company shall advance to Stroud to the extent permitted by law all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by his in connection with a Proceeding within 20 days after receipt by the Company of a written request, with appropriate documentation, for such advance. Such request shall include an undertaking by Stroud to repay the amount of such advance if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified against such costs and expenses.  
  
  


(b) 

Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any proceeding concerning payment of amounts claimed by Stroud that indemnification of Stroud is proper because he has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor a determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that Stroud has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Stroud has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  
  
  


(c) 

The Company agrees to continue and maintain a liability insurance policy covering Stroud to the extent the Company provides such coverage for its other executives and officers.  
  
  


(d) 

Promptly after receipt by Stroud of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which Stroud is entitled to indemnity hereunder, Stroud shall notify the Company in writing of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding, and the Company shall (i) assume the defense of such action or proceeding, (ii) employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to Stroud, and (iii) pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Stroud shall be entitled to employ counsel separate from counsel for the Company and from any other party in such action if Stroud reasonably determines that a conflict of interest exists which makes representation by counsel chosen by the Company not advisable. In such event, the reasonable fees and disbursements of such separate counsel for Stroud shall be paid by the Company to the extent permitted by law.  
  
  


(e) 

After the termination of this Agreement and upon the request of Stroud, the Company agrees to reimburse Stroud for all reasonable travel, legal and other out-of-pocket expenses related to assisting the Company to prepare for or defend against any action, suit, proceeding or claim brought or threatened to be brought against the Company or to prepare for or institute any action, suit, proceeding or claim to be brought or threatened to be brought against a third party arising out of or based upon the transactions contemplated herein and in providing evidence, producing documents or otherwise participating in any such action, suit, proceeding or claim. In the event Stroud is required to appear after termination of this Agreement at a judicial or regulatory hearing in connection with Stroud's employment hereunder, or Stroud's role in connection therewith, the Company agrees to pay Stroud a sum, to be mutually agreed upon by Stroud and the Company, a daily fee and reasonable expenses for each day of his appearance and each day of preparation therefor.
