(each of (1), (2) and (3) a “Lender” and collectively, the “Lenders”);  
  
Whereas:

Borrower requires immediate funds, which, in the current economic climate, it has not been able to obtain in a timely manner from banking institutions, as interim financing until receipt of the proceeds which it anticipates receiving from the rights offering which was approved by Borrower’s Board of Directors on March 26, 2009 and which Borrower expects to proceed as soon as an appropriate SEC Registration Statement becomes effective (forms are pending before SEC) (the “Rights Offering”); and  
  
Whereas:

Borrower has requested that Lenders, all of whom already own shares in Borrower and of whom Lender (1) holds office as CEO and Director of Borrower and Lender (2) holds office as Director of Borrower and CEO of Borrower’s US subsidiary, assist Borrower by agreeing to loan such funds to Borrower in the amount and under the terms set forth in this Agreement below; and  
  
Whereas:

Each Lender is willing to make a loan to Borrower, all subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;  
  
Therefore, the parties have made condition and agreed as follows:

1.

The Loan  
  
1.1

Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Lenders agrees to loan to Borrower the principal amount of $47,000.- (forty-seven thousand US Dollars) (the “Loan”), as follows:  
  
a.

Jacky Ronnel: $15,000;  
  
b.

Ariel Almog: $7,000;  
  
c.

William and PaiWen Buckley: $25,000;  
  
1.2

The Loan will be made available to Borrower within 3 business days of the date hereof (hereinafter: the “Loan Date”), by means of SWIFT wire transfer to Borrower’s account No. 0605079633 at HSBC Republic Bank, a division of HSBC Bank USA, in the branch located at 452, Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10018, or to Borrower’s account No. 703200/66 at Bank Leumi, branch No. 809 in Tel-Aviv, Israel.  
  
2.

Borrower shall pay interest on the entire outstanding balance of the Loan, commencing as of the Loan Date, at the rate of 6% per annum (the “Interest”).

3.

Repayment  
  
3.1

Borrower shall repay the entire Loan, with all accrued Interest, in a single, cash payment to each Lender, pari passu, no later than the 4 month anniversary of the Loan Date (the “Repayment Date”).  
  
3.2

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding Lenders’ declaration that, as at the date hereof, they would prefer for the Loan to be repaid in cash, the Lenders nevertheless agree that Borrower may elect to effect repayment of any part, or all, of the Loan and/or accrued Interest, pari passu to the Lenders, no later than the Repayment Date, by means of the issue to the Lenders of shares of Borrower’s common stock. The purchase price of each share so issued shall be deemed to be the same price per share as in the Rights Offering (the “Price Per Share”), such that the outstanding balance of the Loan plus accrued Interest shall be reduced, at the time of issue of such shares, by the quantity of shares so issued multiplied by the Price Per Share. If, for example, the Price Per Share is $0.04 and if the Repayment Date falls exactly on the 4 month anniversary of the Loan Date, and the outstanding balance of the Loan plus the accrued Interest is $47,940, then the issue, on that date, of 1,198,500 shares of Borrower’s common stock, to the order of the Lenders, pro rata as set forth herein, would constitute full repayment of the Loan and all accrued Interest.  
  
For any sums that may be payable by a Lender in the Rights Offering, in respect of shares which such Lender may subscribe for in such Rights Offering, up to the total amount then owed by Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement, such Lender, or Borrower, may elect, by written notice to the other, that such sums be offset against the outstanding balance of the Loan and accrued Interest then owed to such Lender.

3.3

If Borrower elects to repay any part of the Loan and/or accrued Interest by means of the issue of shares as set forth in Section 0 above, then the shares must be duly issued in Lenders’ names, or to their order, pari passu, and registered in Lenders’ names, or to their order, in Borrower’s share register, and duly executed share certificates must be delivered to Lenders, or to their order, all no later than the Repayment Date.  
  
3.4

For avoidance of any doubt, Borrower undertakes to fully repay the Loan and all accrued Interest, no later than the Repayment Date, either by means of a cash payment as set forth in Section 0 above, or by means of a share issue, as set forth in Sections 0 and 0 above, or by means of a combination of such cash payment and such share issue, provided that all such repayments are made for both Lenders, pari passu.  
  
3.5

Borrower may at any time prepay to the Lenders, pari passu, any part of the outstanding balance of the Loan and accrued Interest, by any of the methods set forth in Section 0 above.  
  
3.6

Without derogating from any statutory remedies and/or other remedies available under the terms of this Agreement, if Borrower is in default under this Agreement and does not fully repay the Loan and accrued Interest in the manner set forth above, no later than the Repayment Date, then each Lender shall be entitled to elect, by means of written notice to Borrower, whether repayment of such Lender’s portion of the outstanding balance of the Loan and accrued Interest must be made by means of cash payment, or by means of share issue under the principles outlined above, or by a combination of these methods, and Borrower undertakes to comply with such election by each Lender.  
  
4.

Late Payment  
  
Without derogating from any statutory remedies and/or other remedies available under the terms of this Agreement, any sums not paid by Borrower at the appointed time under this Agreement shall be subject to interest at the highest rate of interest then charged by Bank Leumi of Israel in respect of Dollar sums overdrawn beyond an agreed credit facility, such interest to accrue from the date payment was originally due until the date of actual payment; this interest rate shall initially be determined on the date payment was originally due, and thereafter monthly until the date of actual payment. Nothing in this Section 0 may be construed in any way as derogating from Borrower’s undertaking and obligation to repay the Loan and pay the Interest as set forth above. Arrears interest accruing pursuant to the terms of this Section 0 shall, for all intents and purposes, be deemed part of the Interest, as defined herein.
