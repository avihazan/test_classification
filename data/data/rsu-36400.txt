ADVANCED FIBRE COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  


RECITALS 

A. The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, non-employee members of the Board or of the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary and consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 

B. Optionee is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or a Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation’s grant of an option to Optionee. 

C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix. 

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows: 

1\. GRANT OF OPTION. The Corporation hereby grants to Optionee, as of the Grant Date, an option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Grant Notice. The Option Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the option term specified in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price. 

2\. OPTION TERM. This option shall have a term of ten (10) years measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 5 or 6. 

3\. LIMITED TRANSFERABILITY. If this option is designated an Incentive Option in the Grant Notice, then this option shall be neither transferable nor assignable by Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution following Optionee’s death and may be exercised, during Optionee’s lifetime, only by Optionee. However, if this option is designated a Non-Statutory Option in the Grant Notice, then this option may, in connection with the Optionee’s estate plan, be assigned in whole or in part during Optionee’s lifetime to one or more members of the Optionee’s immediate family or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of one or more such family members. The assigned portion shall be exercisable only by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to such assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for this option immediately prior to such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate. 

* * *

##### 

4\. DATES OF EXERCISE. This option shall become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as specified in the Grant Notice. As the option becomes exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate and the option shall remain exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the option term under Paragraph 5 or 6. 

5\. CESSATION OF SERVICE. The option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this option shall cease to be outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions become applicable: 

(i) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Permanent Disability or Misconduct) while this option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of three (3) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option, but in no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 

(ii) Should Optionee die while this option is outstanding, then the personal representative of Optionee’s estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to Optionee’s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution shall have the right to exercise this option. Such right shall lapse, and this option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the EARLIER of (A) the expiration of the twelve (12)- month period measured from the date of Optionee’s death or (B) the Expiration Date. 

(iii) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Permanent Disability while this option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of twelve (12) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option. In no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 

(iv) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested Option Shares for which the option is exercisable at the time of Optionee’s cessation of Service. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares for which the option has not been exercised. However, this option shall, immediately upon Optionee’s cessation of Service for any reason, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any Option Shares in which Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested or for which this option is not otherwise at that time exercisable. 

2 

* * *

##### 

(v) Should Optionee’s Service be terminated for Misconduct, then this option shall terminate immediately and cease to  
remain outstanding. 

6\. SPECIAL ACCELERATION OF OPTION. 

(a) This option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction but not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested shares of Common Stock. No such acceleration of this option, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) this option is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or to be replaced with a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) this option is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested Option Shares at the time of the Corporate Transaction (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such shares) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the option exercise/vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. The determination of option comparability under clause (i) shall be made by the Plan Administrator, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

(b) Immediately following the Corporate Transaction, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 

(c) If this option is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to Optionee in consummation of such Corporate Transaction had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, PROVIDED the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. 

(d) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

7\. ADJUSTMENT IN OPTION SHARES. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be 

3 

* * *

##### 

made to (i) the total number and/or class of securities subject to this option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. 

8\. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS. The holder of this option shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares. 

9\. MANNER OF EXERCISING OPTION. 

(a) In order to exercise this option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) must take the following actions: 

(i) Execute and deliver to the Corporation a Notice of Exercise for the Option Shares for which the option is  
exercised. 

(ii) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares in one or more of the following forms: 

(A) cash or check made payable to the Corporation; 

(B) a promissory note payable to the Corporation, but only to the extent authorized by the Plan Administrator in  
accordance with Paragraph 13; 

(C) shares of Common Stock held by Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Corporation’s earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date; or 

(D) to the extent the option is exercised for vested Option Shares, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (I) to a Corporation-designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local income and employment taxes 

4 

* * *

##### 

required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (II) to the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction. 

Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must accompany the Notice of Exercise delivered to the Corporation in connection with the option exercise. 

(iii) Furnish to the Corporation appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the option (if  
other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this option. 

(iv) Make appropriate arrangements with the Corporation (or Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all Federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the option exercise. 

(b) As soon as practical after the Exercise Date, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the appropriate legends affixed thereto. 

(c) In no event may this option be exercised for any fractional shares. 

10\. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. 

(a) The exercise of this option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Optionee with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance. 

(b) The inability of the Corporation to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Corporation to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall relieve the Corporation of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Corporation, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals.

* * *

##### 

11\. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3 and 6, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns and Optionee, Optionee’s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Optionee’s estate. 

12\. NOTICES. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Optionee shall be in writing and addressed to Optionee at the address indicated below Optionee’s signature line on the Grant Notice. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

13\. FINANCING. The Plan Administrator may, in its absolute discretion and without any obligation to do so, permit Optionee to pay the Exercise Price for the purchased Option Shares by delivering a full-recourse promissory note payable to the Corporation. The terms of any such promissory note (including the interest rate, the requirements for collateral and the terms of repayment) shall be established by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion. 

14\. CONSTRUCTION. This Agreement and the option evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. All decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in this option. 

15\. GOVERNING LAW. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without resort to that State’s conflict-of-laws rules. 

16\. EXCESS SHARES. If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of shares of Common Stock which may without stockholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 

17\. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO AN INCENTIVE OPTION. In the event this option is designated an Incentive Option in the Grant Notice, the following terms and conditions shall also apply to the grant: 

\- This option shall cease to qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option if (and to the extent) this option is exercised for one or more Option Shares: (A) more than three (3) months after the 

6 

* * *

##### 

date Optionee ceases to be an Employee for any reason other than death or Permanent Disability or (B) more than twelve (12) months after the date Optionee ceases to be an Employee by reason of Permanent Disability. 

\- No installment under this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option if (and to the extent) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which such installment first becomes exercisable hereunder would, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or any other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should such One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in any calendar year, this option shall nevertheless become exercisable for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option. 

\- Should the exercisability of this option be accelerated upon a Corporate Transaction, then this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option only to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which this option first becomes exercisable in the calendar year in which the Corporate Transaction occurs does not, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or one or more other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in the calendar year of such Corporate Transaction, the option may nevertheless be exercised for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option. 

\- Should Optionee hold, in addition to this option, one or more other options to purchase Common Stock which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year as this option, then the foregoing limitations on the exercisability of such options as Incentive Options shall be applied on the basis of the order in which such options are granted. 

18\. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. The following provisions shall apply upon the Optionee’s commencement of an authorized leave of absence: 

7 

* * *

##### 

(a) The exercise schedule in effect under the Grant Notice shall be frozen as of the first day of the authorized leave, and this option shall not become exercisable for any additional installments of the Option Shares during the period Optionee remains on such leave. 

(b) Should Optionee resume active Employee status within sixty (60) days after the start date of the authorized leave, Optionee shall, for purposes of the exercise schedule set forth in the Grant Notice, receive Service credit for the entire period of such leave. If Optionee does not resume active Employee status within such sixty (60)-day period, then no Service credit shall be given for the period of such leave. 

(c) If the option is designated as an Incentive Option in the Grant Notice, then the following additional provision shall apply: 

\- If the leave of absence continues for more than ninety (90) days, then this option shall automatically convert to a Non-Statutory Option under the Federal tax laws on the ninety-first (91st) day of such leave, unless the Optionee’s reemployment rights are guaranteed by statute or by written agreement. Following any such conversion of the option, all subsequent exercises of such option, whether effected before or after Optionee’s return to active Employee status, shall result in an immediate taxable event, and the Corporation shall be required to collect from Optionee the Federal, state and local income and employment withholding taxes applicable to such exercise. 

(d) In no event shall this option become exercisable for any additional Option Shares or otherwise remain outstanding if Optionee does not resume Employee status prior to the Expiration Date of the option term.

ADDENDUM  
TO  
STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT 

The following provisions are hereby incorporated into, and are hereby made a part of, that certain Stock Option Agreement dated 2- (the “Option Agreement”) by and between Advanced Fibre Communications, Inc. (the “Corporation”) and 1- (“Optionee”) evidencing the stock option (the “Option”) granted on such date to Optionee under the terms of the Corporation’s 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, and such provisions shall be effective immediately. All capitalized terms in this Addendum, to the extent not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Option Agreement. 

LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT 

1\. Optionee is hereby granted a limited stock appreciation right exercisable upon the following terms and conditions: 

\- Optionee shall have the unconditional right (exercisable at any time during the thirty (30)-day period immediately following a Hostile Take- Over) to surrender the Option to the Corporation, to the extent the Option is at the time exercisable for vested shares of Common Stock. In return for the surrendered Option, Optionee shall receive a cash distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the Take-Over Price of the shares of Common Stock which are at the time vested under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion) over (B) the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such shares. 

\- To exercise this limited stock appreciation right, Optionee must, during the applicable thirty (30)-day exercise period, provide the Corporation with written notice of the option surrender in which there is specified the number of Option Shares as to which the Option is being surrendered. Such notice must be accompanied by the return of Optionee’s copy of the Option Agreement, together with any written amendments to such Agreement. The cash distribution shall be paid to Optionee within five (5) days following such delivery date, and neither the approval of the Plan Administrator nor the consent of the Board shall be required in connection with such option surrender and cash distribution. Upon receipt of such cash distribution, the Option shall be cancelled with respect to the Option Shares for which the Option has been surrendered, and Optionee shall cease to have any further right to acquire those Option Shares under the Option Agreement. The Option shall, however, remain outstanding and exercisable for the balance of the Option Shares (if any) in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement, and the Corporation shall issue a new stock option agreement (substantially in the same form of the surrendered Option Agreement) for those remaining Option Shares.

This limited stock appreciation right shall in all events terminate upon the expiration or sooner termination of the option term and may not be assigned or transferred by Optionee. 

2\. For purposes of this Addendum, the following definitions shall be in effect: 

\- A HOSTILE TAKE-OVER shall be deemed to occur in the event any person or related group of persons (other than the Corporation or a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Corporation) directly or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of securities possessing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Corporation’s outstanding securities pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Corporation’s stockholders which the Board does not recommend such stockholders to accept. 

\- The TAKE-OVER PRICE per share shall be deemed to be equal to the GREATER of (A) the Fair Market Value per Option Share on the option surrender date or (B) the highest reported price per share of Common Stock paid by the tender offeror in effecting the Hostile Take-Over. However, if the surrendered Option is designated as an Incentive Option in the Grant Notice, then the Take-Over Price shall not exceed the clause (A) price per share.
