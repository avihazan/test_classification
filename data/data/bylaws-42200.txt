## Section 3.9. Action by Consent of Directors. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or the committee of the board, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, which may be in counterparts, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or the committee thereof.

Such stockholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the written consent of such person to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected); and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation’s books, of such stockholder, and (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder.

The corporation agrees and hereby does undertake to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that that person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by that person in connection with such action, all as set forth in Section 7-109-101 et seq.

## Section 8.2. Insurance. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation or of any other person or employee benefit plan against any liability asserted against or incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII and the provisions of the CBCA. Any such insurance may be procured from any insurance company designated by the Board of Directors of the corporation, whether such insurance company is formed under the laws of this state or any other jurisdiction of the United States or elsewhere, including any insurance company in which the corporation has equity or any other interest, through stock ownership or otherwise.

## Section 8.3. Advancement of Expenses. Without limiting the generality of this Article VIII, the corporation shall advance the expenses incurred by any person entitled to indemnification hereunder in connection with any action, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding. Provided that the person seeking advances has furnished the undertaking, if any, required by CBCA Section 7-109-104(1), advances shall be unsecured and interest free, and shall be made without regard to such person’s financial ability to make repayment of the expenses, and without regard to such person’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification, other than as required by CBCA 7-109-104(1)(c). Advances shall include any and all expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the corporation to support the advances claimed. The person entitled to indemnification shall qualify for advances solely upon the compliance with the requirements of CBCA 7-109-104, and the Company shall promptly make the determinations required thereunder with respect to any request for advances.
