W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Executive desire to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the Executive shall purchase, and the Corporation shall sell, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein and the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties agree as follows:

1. Shares.

## (a) The Corporation shall authorize the issuance and sale to the Executive of up to 50,000 shares of its Common Stock or such lesser number as he shall elect to purchase pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

## 

## (b) Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Employment Agreement, dated concurrently herewith, between the Corporation and Executive (the “Employment Agreement”), the Executive shall have the right to purchase 50,000 or a lesser number of shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), at a price per share equal to the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the Closing Date; provided, however, that if the Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date, as defined in Section 1(d), the price per share shall be equal to the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported for the principal public securities market in which the Common Stock is then trading on such Closing Date (the “Right to Purchase”).

## 

## (c) The Executive’s Right to Purchase shall be exercisable at any time during the 15-day period following the date of this Agreement; provided, however, the Right to Purchase, to the extent not already exercised, shall terminate if the Executive ceases to be employed by the Corporation during such 15-day period.

## 

## (d) If the Executive wishes to exercise his Right to Purchase, he must provide written notice to the Corporation prior to the expiration of the 15-day period specified in Section 1(c) above. The notice shall set forth the number of Shares he wishes to acquire and the proposed closing date (the “Closing Date”) for the acquisition (in no case shall such Closing Date be less than two (2) business days or more than five (5) business days following such notice).

* * *

  


## (e) On the Closing Date, the Corporation shall deliver to the Executive a certificate representing the number of Shares that the Executive elected to purchase pursuant to the written notice delivered pursuant to Section 1(d), and the Executive shall deliver to the Corporation payment for such Shares by a cashier’s or certified check or wire transfer of funds in the amount of consideration determined in accordance with Section 1(b). The shares shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

## 

## (f) Neither the Shares, nor any interest therein or amount payable in respect thereof, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntary, until the earliest to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the Effective Date, (ii) the day upon which the Grantee’s employment with the Corporation terminates under any of the circumstances described in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c) of the Employment Agreement and the Grantee is entitled to the severance benefits provided thereunder (after having met the requirements thereunder, including, without limitation, having provided the required release as contemplated by the Employment Agreement), or (iii) immediately preceding a Change in Control Event (as such term is defined in the Corporation’s 2001 Stock Option Plan (the “2001 Plan”) or a Going Private Transaction (as defined below). The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to transfers to the Corporation.

## 

## (g) In connection with each purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant hereto, the Executive represents and warrants to the Corporation that:

## 

### (i) the Shares to be acquired by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be acquired for the Executive’s own account and not with a view to, or in connection with, a distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any applicable state securities laws, and the Shares will not be disposed of in contravention of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws;

### 

### (ii) the Executive is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act and is sophisticated in financial matters;

### 

### (iii) the Executive is able to bear the economic risk of his investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of time because the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available;

### 

### (iv) the Executive has had the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Corporation and its management concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Common Stock and to obtain information regarding the Corporation’s condition (financial and otherwise) and operations; and

### 

### (v) this Agreement and each of the other agreements contemplated hereby to which such Executive is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Executive, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and limitations on the availability of equitable remedies, and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and such other agreements by such Executive does not and

### shall not conflict with, violate or cause a breach of any agreement, contract or instrument to which the Executive is a party or any judgment or decree to which the Executive is subject;

### 

## (h) As an inducement to the Executive to enter into this Agreement and purchase the Shares, the Corporation hereby represents and warrants to the Executive that:

## 

### (i) The Corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, operating results, assets, operations or business prospects of the Corporation.

### 

### (ii) The Corporation has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement and each of the other agreements contemplated hereby to which the Corporation is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Corporation, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and limitations on the availability of equitable remedies. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Corporation.

### 

2. Regulation D Under the Securities Act. The Executive and the Corporation hereby acknowledge and agree that the securities purchased by the Executive hereunder are being issued in reliance in part on the exemption from registration provided in Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he shall sell the securities purchased hereunder only pursuant to registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an exemption from registration available thereunder.

3. Legend.

(a) The certificates, if any, representing the Shares shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

“THESE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE LAW. THEY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR PLEDGED WITHOUT (1) REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE LAW, OR (2) AT HOLDER’S EXPENSE, AN OPINION (SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION) OF COUNSEL (SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION) THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.”

(b) In addition, the certificates, if any, representing the Shares shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

“THE OWNERSHIP OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES OF STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY AND ANY INTEREST THEREIN ARE

* * *

  


SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER UNDER AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND MSC.SOFTWARE CORPORATION. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF MSC.SOFTWARE.”

The legend set forth in this Section 3(b) shall be removed from the certificates evidencing the Shares upon the occurrence of one of the events set forth in Section 1(f).

4. Registration Rights. The Corporation agrees that, at its own expense, it will use reasonable efforts to register all shares of Common Stock covered by this Agreement on a Form S-8 Registration Statement (including a reoffer prospectus prepared in accordance with the SEC’s General Instructions to Form S-8) under the Securities Act promptly after the Corporation is first able to file and have declared effective such a Registration Statement. The Corporation shall promptly remove the legend described in Section 3(a) from the certificates when the shares have been registered and the Registration Statement is effective. The Grantee agrees that, in connection with any resale of the shares, the Grantee will sell such shares pursuant to such reoffer prospectus, will deliver such reoffer prospectus in accordance with applicable securities laws, and will otherwise comply with applicable laws as to such sale.

5. Corporation’s Obligation to Repurchase Upon a Change in Control Event or Going Private Transaction. If, as a result of a Change in Control Event (within the meaning of clause (b) of the definition of such term in the Corporation’s 2001 Stock Option Plan) or a Going Private Transaction, the Common Stock of the Corporation is no longer readily tradable on an established securities market, the Executive shall have the right to require the Corporation, immediately before such Change in Control Event or Going Private Transaction, to purchase any or all of the shares of Common Stock acquired by, or issued to, the Executive under this Agreement and then held by him (to the extent the Executive is not permitted or required to sell such shares in the transaction giving rise to the Change in Control Event or Going Private Transaction, as the case may be) on substantially the same per-share terms as the Corporation’s stockholders selling Common Stock in such transaction generally for an amount not less than the price paid (on a per share basis) to the other holders of the Common Stock whose stock was acquired in connection with the Change in Control Event or Going Private Transaction, as the case may be, multiplied by the number of shares sold by the Executive to the Corporation. The Executive’s right under this Section 5 is subject to the Corporation’s ability to effect such a repurchase of shares in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Going Private Transaction” shall mean a transaction which does not constitute a Change of Control Event, but in which all or substantially all of the shares of Common Stock of the Corporation are purchased or otherwise acquired, including a redemption by the Corporation, and in connection with such transaction, or series of transactions, the Common Stock ceases to be traded on an established securities exchange.

6. Corporation’s Obligation to Repurchase Upon Termination of Employment. If the Executive’s employment with the Corporation terminates for any reason at a time when there is no public trading of the Corporation’s Common Stock, the Executive shall have the right to require the Corporation to purchase any or all of the shares of Common Stock acquired by, or issued to, the Executive under this Agreement within sixty (60) days of such termination or, if later, within sixty (60) days after the Corporation is able to repurchase such shares in compliance

with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Executive and the Corporation shall mutually agree on the fair market value for such shares, and in the event that no mutual agreement can be reached, the determination of the fair market value for such shares shall be determined in accordance with an appraisal procedure set out in a letter agreement of even date herewith. The Executive’s right under this Section 6 is subject to the Corporation’s ability to effect such a repurchase of shares in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
