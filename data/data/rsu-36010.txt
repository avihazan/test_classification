EXHIBIT 10.5



THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made as of the Option Grant Date set forth on the initial Notice of Grant attached hereto by and between (i) WEBMETHODS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”), and (ii) Participant, an employee of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or Parent, named on each Notice of Grant attached hereto. 

The Corporation has adopted an Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (with all amendments thereto, the “Plan”), a copy of which has been provided or made available to Participant. 

In consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual promises set forth in this Agreement and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Option. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and each respective Notice of Grant, the Corporation hereby grants to Participant the right to purchase, during the period specified in Section 2, the number of shares of Incentive Stock (those shares of Incentive Stock are referred to as the “Shares”) set forth on the respective Notice of Grant at an exercise price of per Share set forth on that Notice of Grant, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, that Notice of Grant and the Plan (that right is referred to as the “Option”).

2\. Duration of Option. The Option shall be effective during the period commencing as of the Option Grant Date and ending on the earliest to occur of: (a) failure of Participant to return a signed copy of the Notice of Grant (and, if the initial Notice of Grant, a signed copy of this Agreement) to the Corporation by the Return Date indicated in such Notice of Grant; (b) the date all of the Shares are purchased pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or are surrendered to the Corporation; (c) ninety (90) days after the date Participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation or any Subsidiary or Parent (except for termination due to the death of Participant); (d) the expiration of the one (1)-year period prescribed under Section 3.B; and (e) at 5:00 P.M. local time at the headquarters of the Corporation on the day immediately preceding the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Option Grant Date. Upon the expiration of the Option, the Option shall have no further force or effect, and Participant shall have no further rights in or under the Option or to the Shares that shall not have been purchased by that time pursuant to the Option. 

3\. Exercise of Option. 

A. Subject to the provisions of Section 2 regarding the duration of the Option, and except as provided below, the Option shall vest in periodic increments commencing on the Vesting Start Date as provided in the respective Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, vesting of the Option shall terminate immediately upon the Participant ceasing to be employed with the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent. The Option may be exercised only to the extent the Option is vested. 

The Option may be exercised only if Participant is in compliance with all covenants in, and provisions of, this Agreement and if compliance with all applicable securities laws can be effected and only by (i) Participant’s completion, execution and delivery (by written or electronic means) to the Corporation of a Notice and Request of Exercise in the form specified by the Corporation, (ii) the payment to the Corporation, as provided in Section 3.C, of an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price by the number of Shares being purchased pursuant to such exercise, as shall be specified by Participant in such notice of exercise and (iii) if tax withholding applies to such exercise, the payment to the Corporation, as provided in Section 3.C, of an amount calculated by the Corporation to be sufficient to satisfy applicable Federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding requirements. Except in the event of the death of a Participant, in which event Participant’s estate, executors or administrators, or personal or legal representatives may exercise the Option in accordance with the terms of Section 3.B, the Option or any of the rights thereunder may be exercised by Participant only, and may not, on an absolute or contingent basis, be transferred or assigned, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law (including, without limitation, the laws of bankruptcy, intestacy, descent and distribution and succession). 

B. In the event of the death of Participant at such time that Participant shall possess an Option pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Participant’s estate, executors or administrators, or personal or legal representatives shall be entitled, for a period of one (1) year following the date of Participant’s death, to exercise the Option, but only to the extent that Participant was entitled to exercise the Option on the date of such death. Any person so desiring to exercise Participant’s Option shall be required, as a condition to the exercise of the Option, to furnish to the Corporation such documentation as the Corporation shall deem satisfactory to evidence the 

* * *

##### 

exclusive authority of such person to exercise the Option on behalf of Participant. In the event of the exercise of the Option by Participant’s estate, executors or administrators, or personal or legal representatives, all references herein to Participant shall, to the extent applicable, be deemed to refer to and include such estate, executors or administrators, or personal or legal representatives, as the case may be. 

C. Payment of the amount determined pursuant to Section 3.A shall be made (i) by cash, (ii) by good check, (iii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by Participant valued at their fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith (which shares of Common Stock shall have been owned by Participant at least six (6) months prior to such delivery), (iv) by the assignment of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the Shares being acquired upon exercise of the Option (including without limitation, through an exercise complying with Regulation T or rules promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Corporation shall determine or (v) in such other manner as shall then be acceptable to, and permitted by, the Board of Directors. In addition, the Participant may satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements by electing to have the Corporation withhold from the Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option a number of whole shares having a fair market value (determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is fixed) not in excess of the aggregate minimum withholding amount required by statute. 

D. Upon the exercise of the Option by Participant, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to Participant a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of Shares as Participant has so elected to receive. Such certificate or certificates shall be registered in the name of Participant and, if applicable, shall bear an appropriate investment warranty legend, any legends required by any applicable securities law, rule or regulation, any legend referring to the restrictions provided hereunder and under the Plan and any legend required by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Corporation. Upon the exercise of the Option and the issuance and delivery of such certificate or certificates, Participant shall have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares and to receive all dividends or other distributions paid or made with respect thereto; provided, however, that such Shares shall be subject to the restrictions hereunder and in the Plan (if any). 

E. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may, upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by Participant of Participant’s right to exercise the Option, in whole or in part, and authorize a payment in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the difference obtained by subtracting the sum of (i) the Exercise Price of the Shares which are the subject of such surrendered Option and (ii) an amount calculated by the Corporation to be sufficient to satisfy applicable Federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding requirements from the fair market value of the Shares which are the subject of such surrendered Option on the date of such surrender (such amount not to be less than zero), such payment to be in cash. 

F. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any unvested portion of the Option shall thereupon vest and the entire Option shall thereupon become immediately exercisable if, within one (1) year after a Change of Control of the Corporation, there is (i) a termination of Participant’s employment by the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent other than for Cause (as defined below) or (ii) a voluntary termination by Participant of Participant’s employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent within ninety (90) days after Good Reason (as defined below) shall first exist. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall mean (i) embezzlement, theft, fraud, or any other act of dishonesty involving the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent or any of their customers, suppliers or business partners, (ii) Participant’s conviction of a felony, or any other crime involving moral turpitude, or (iii) a violation of a written agreement between Participant and the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent, including but not limited to Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of this Agreement, that certain Proprietary Information and Assignment of Inventions Agreement or that certain letter agreement providing for nondisclosure of “Protected Information” and assignment of inventions. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean (i) a material reduction in Participant’s base salary, (ii) a material reduction in Participant’s duties without Participant’s consent, or (iii) a relocation of Participant’s regular place of work to any location outside a thirty (30) mile radius of the location from which Participant served the Corporation or a Subsidiary or Parent thirty (30) days prior to the date of such Change of Control of the Corporation without Participant’s consent. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Change of Control” of the Corporation shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any person or group acquires, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two-step 

\- 2 - 

* * *

##### 

transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving the Corporation), ownership of not less than a majority of the then outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, (ii) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a merger or consolidation involving the Corporation and resulting in a change of ownership of a majority of the then outstanding shares of voting securities of the Corporation, or (iii) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or the sale or disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets. 

4\. Changes in Capital Structure of the Corporation. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Corporation and the provisions of the applicable law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Corporation, the number of Shares subject to this Agreement as well as the Exercise Price of any Shares not yet purchased by Participant shall be proportionately adjusted for (a) a division or combination of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation, (b) a dividend payable in shares of capital stock of the Corporation or (c) a reclassification of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation. 

5\. Rights Prior to Exercise. Participant shall have no equity interest in the Corporation or any voting, dividend, liquidation or dissolution rights with respect to any capital stock of the Corporation solely by reason of having an Option or having executed this Agreement or any Notice of Grant hereto. Furthermore, prior to the exercise of all or a portion of the Option, as set forth in Section 3.A, and the issuance and delivery of a certificate or certificates evidencing the Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of all or a portion of such Option, Participant shall have no interest in, or any voting, dividend, liquidation or dissolution rights with respect to, the Shares. 

6\. Treatment of Information. 

A. Participant covenants and agrees that Participant shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Corporation, or except if Participant is acting as an employee of the Corporation solely for the benefit of the Corporation in connection with the Corporation’s business and in accordance with the Corporation’s business practices and employee policies, at any time during or within ten (10) years following termination of Participant’s employment by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, disclose, divulge, reveal, report, publish, transfer or use, for any purpose whatsoever, any Confidential Information in any form or format which has been obtained by or disclosed to Participant as a result of Participant’s employment with the Corporation. “Confidential Information” shall include, without limitation: the terms and conditions of this Agreement; trade secrets; systems; technology; computer programs, related object and source code or documentation; databases and data residing therein or derived therefrom; procedures; manuals or confidential reports or analysis; the agreements with or terms of any relationship or agreement with any distributor, reseller, customer, systems integrator, business partner or strategic partner; financial, marketing or sales information and strategy; pricing or accounting data or methods; licenses, business arrangements or related documentation; the identity of and lists and/or electronic mail addresses relating to customers, prospective customers, systems integrators, business partners or strategic partners; personal information and electronic mail addresses or telephone numbers for employees of or contractors to the Corporation or any subsidiary; information, concepts, discoveries or ideas relating to the Corporation’s past, present and future technology, software, services and techniques; information concerning competitive analysis or strategy; inventions, improvements, techniques, designs or other technical data; or other information, data or materials concerning any of the Corporation’s business methods, personnel, practices or strategies.

B. Disclosure of any Confidential Information shall not be prohibited if such disclosure is required by a valid and existing order of a court or other governmental body or agency within the United States; provided, however, that (i) Participant shall first have given prompt notice to the Corporation of any possible or prospective order (or proceeding pursuant to which any such order may result) and (ii)
