Section 12. - Record Date for Stockholders; Closing of Transfer Books.

The Board may fix, in advance, a date as the record for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of stockholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or entitled to the allotment of any rights, or for any other proper purpose. Such date in any case shall not be more than 90 days (and in the case of a meeting of stockholders not less than 10 days) prior to the date on which the 

4

In case of an attack on the United States or on a locality in which the Corporation conducts its business or customarily holds meetings of the Board or the stockholders, or during any nuclear or atomic disaster, or during the existence of any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board cannot readily be convened for action in accordance with the provisions of the by-laws, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of an Emergency Committee during such emergency. Upon termination of such emergency the Emergency Committee shall cease to be operative unless and until another such emergency shall occur.

The Emergency Committee shall consist of those persons who are Directors at the time of the Emergency and who are present or available at the Emergency Corporate Headquarters or able and willing to meet in accordance with Section 6 of Article III of the by-laws. Three persons shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Emergency Committee; provided that, if the Emergency Committee shall have fewer than three members, all members shall be present in order to constitute a quorum. If at least one Director is so serving, the Emergency Committee shall have all the powers of the Board of Directors for the duration of the emergency, except for such powers as may not by law be delegated to a committee.

If there are no such Directors present or available at the Emergency Corporate Headquarters or able to meet in accordance with Section 6 of Article III of the by-laws, the function and duties of the Emergency Committee shall be fulfilled by an Emergency Management Team until such time as an Emergency Committee can be constituted. The Emergency Management Team shall consist of the three highest-ranking Officers or employees of the Corporation present or available and any other persons appointed by them. Priority in equally ranked employees will be determined by seniority of first election to that office, or if two or more shall have been first elected to such offices on the same day, in the order of their seniority in age.

At such time as it is practicable to do so, the Emergency Management Team shall call a meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing Directors.

During any such emergency, a meeting of the Emergency Committee may be called by any member thereof. Notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given by any available means of communication by the person calling the meeting to such of the Directors as it may be feasible to reach. Such notice shall be given at such time in advance of the meeting as, in the judgment of the person calling the meeting, circumstances permit. As a result of any emergency, the Emergency Committee may determine that a meeting of stockholders not be held at any place, but instead be held solely by means of remote communication.

Section 3. \- - Power.

The Emergency Committee will not be bound by any requirement of the by-laws which a majority of the Emergency Committee believes is impracticable under the circumstances. The Emergency Committee in all cases shall act by majority vote.

The Emergency Committee during such emergency, may, effective in the emergency, change the principal office or designate several alternative principal officer or regional offices, or authorize the Officers to do so. Unless and until the Emergency Committee shall designate another office, the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Maryland shall be the Emergency Corporate Headquarters.
