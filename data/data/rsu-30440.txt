ANNEX A

  


TO

  


MDU RESOURCES GROUP, INC.

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE PLAN

  


PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT

  


It is understood and agreed that the Award of Performance Shares evidenced by the Award Agreement to which this is annexed is subject to the following additional terms and conditions.

  


1\. Nature of Award. The Target Award represents the opportunity to receive shares of Company common stock, $1.00 par value ("Shares") and Dividend Equivalents on such Shares. The number of Shares that may be earned under this Award shall be determined pursuant to Section 2 hereof. The amount of Dividend Equivalents that may be earned under this Award shall be determined pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Except for Dividend Equivalents, which are paid in cash, Awards will be paid in Shares.

  


2A. Determination of Number of Shares Earned.

  


Subject to the provisions of Section 2B below, the number of Shares earned, if any, for the Performance Period shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

  


# of Shares = Payout Percentage X Target Award

  


The "Payout Percentage" is based on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to that of the Peer Group listed on Annex B (the "Percentile Rank") for the Performance Period, determined in accordance with the following table:

  
  
  
Percentile Rank

Payout Percentage

(% of Target Award)  
  
75th or higher

200%  
  
50th

100%  
  
25th

20%  
  
less than 25th

0%  
  
  


If the Company achieves a Percentile Rank between the 25th and 50th percentiles, the Payout Percentage shall be equal to 20%, plus 3.2% for each Percentile Rank whole percentage above the 25th percentile. If the Company achieves a Percentile Ranking between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the Payout Percentage shall be equal to 100%, plus 4.0% for each Percentile Rank whole percentage above the 50th percentile.

If the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, the number of shares otherwise earned, if any, for the Performance Period will be reduced in accordance with the following table:

  
  
  
TSR

Reduction In Award  
  
0% through -5%

50%  
  
-5.01% through -10%

60%  
  
-10.01% through -15%

70%  
  
-15.01% through -20%

80%  
  
-20.01% through -25%

90%  
  
-25.01% or below

100%  
  
  


The Percentile Rank of a given company's TSR is defined as the percentage of the Peer Group companies' returns falling at or below the given company's TSR. The formula for calculating the Percentile Rank follows:  
  
Percentile Rank = (n - r + 1)/n x 100  
  
Where:  
  
n =

total number of companies in the Peer Group, including the Company  
  
r =

the numeric rank of the Company's TSR relative to the Peer Group, where the highest

return in the group is ranked number 1  
  
To illustrate, if the Company's TSR is the third highest in the Peer Group comprised of 23 companies, its Percentile Rank would be 91. The calculation is: (23 - 3 + 1)/23 x 100 = 91.

The Percentile Rank shall be rounded to the nearest whole percentage.

  


If the common stock of a company in the Peer Group ceases to be traded during the Performance Period, the company will be deleted from the Peer Group. Percentile Rank will be calculated without regard to the return of the deleted company.

  


If the Company or a company in the Peer Group spins off a segment of its business, the shares of the spun-off entity will be treated as a cash dividend that is reinvested in the Company or the company in the Peer Group.

  


Total shareholder return is the percentage change in the value of an investment in the common stock of a company from the initial investment made on the last trading day in the calendar year preceding the beginning of the performance period through the last trading day in the final year of the performance period. It is assumed that dividends are reinvested in additional shares of common stock at the frequency paid.

  


All Performance Shares that are not earned for the Performance Period shall be forfeited.

2B. Determination of Number of Shares Earned Upon a Disposition of Fidelity.

  


If during the Performance Period (i) not less than 75 percent of the assets as of December 31, 2014 of Fidelity Exploration & Production Company ("Fidelity") as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the "Asset Threshold"), is disposed of or (ii) not less than 100 percent of the common stock of Fidelity owned by WBI Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 (the "Stock Threshold") is disposed of, in either case in one or more transactions and to a person or persons not consolidated with the Company for SEC reporting purposes, the provisions of this Section 2B shall apply instead of the provisions of Section 2A above.

  


The following companies shall be removed from the Peer Group listed on Annex B as of the end of the last day of the month (the "Adjustment Date") immediately preceding the month during which occurs the closing of the last transaction that causes the Asset Threshold or the Stock Threshold, as the case may be, to have been met: Bill Barrett Corporation and SM Energy Company. The Peer Group as so adjusted shall be referred to as the "Adjusted Peer Group."

  


The number of Shares earned, if any, for the Performance Period shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

  


# of Shares = Payout Percentage X Target Award

  


The "Payout Percentage" is based on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to that of the Peer Group and the Adjusted Peer Group (the "Percentile Rank") for the Performance Period, determined in accordance with the following table:

  
  
  
Percentile Rank

Payout Percentage

(% of Target Award)  
  
75th or higher

200%  
  
50th

100%  
  
25th

20%  
  
less than 25th

0%  
  
  


If the Company achieves a Percentile Rank between the 25th and 50th percentiles, the Payout Percentage shall be equal to 20%, plus 3.2% for each Percentile Rank whole percentage above the 25th percentile. If the Company achieves a Percentile Ranking between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the Payout Percentage shall be equal to 100%, plus 4.0% for each Percentile Rank whole percentage above the 50th percentile.

If the Company’s TSR for the entire Performance Period is negative, the number of shares otherwise earned, if any, for the Performance Period will be reduced in accordance with the following table:

  
  
  
TSR

Reduction In Award  
  
0% through -5%

50%  
  
-5.01% through -10%

60%  
  
-10.01% through -15%

70%  
  
-15.01% through -20%

80%  
  
-20.01% through -25%

90%  
  
-25.01% or below

100%  
  
  


The Percentile Rank of a given company's TSR is defined as the percentage of the Peer Group or Adjusted Peer Group companies' returns falling at or below the given company's TSR. The formula for calculating the Percentile Rank follows:

  
  
  
Percentile Rank = (((n - r + 1)/n x 100) x m/36) + (((na – ra + 1)/na x 100) x ma/36)  
  
Where:  
  
n =

total number of companies in the Peer Group, including the Company  
  
na =

total number of companies in the Adjusted Peer Group, including the Company  
  
r =

the numeric rank of the Company's TSR relative to the Peer Group for the period beginning on the first day of the Performance Period and ending on the Adjustment Date, where the highest return in the group is ranked number 1  
  
ra =

the numeric rank of the Company's TSR relative to the Adjusted Peer Group for the period beginning on the day after the Adjustment Date and ending on the last day of the Performance Period, where the highest return in the group is ranked number 1  
  
m =

the number of whole months in the period beginning on the first day of the Performance Period and ending on the Adjustment Date  
  
ma =

36 - m  
  
To illustrate, if (i) the Adjustment Date occurs at the end of the 12th month of the Performance Period, (ii) the Company's TSR is the third highest in the Peer Group comprised of 23 companies for the first 12 months of the Performance Period and (iii) the Company’s TSR is the 8th highest in the Adjusted Peer Group comprised of 18 companies for the remaining 24 months of the Performance Period, then the Company’s Percentile Rank for the entire Performance Period would be 71. The calculation is: (23 - 3 + 1)/23 x 100 x 12/36 plus (18 - 8 + 1)/18 x 100 x 24/36 = 71.

The Percentile Rank shall be rounded to the nearest whole percentage.

  


If, on or before the Adjustment Date during the Performance Period, the common stock of a company in the Peer Group ceases to be traded, the company will be deleted from the Peer Group and the Adjusted Peer Group. If, after the Adjustment Date during the Performance Period, the common stock of a company in the Adjusted Peer Group ceases to be traded, the company will be deleted from the Adjusted Peer Group. Percentile Rank will be calculated without regard to the return of any company so deleted from the Peer Group and/or the Adjusted Peer Group.

  


If, on or before the Adjustment Date during the Performance Period, the Company or a company in the Peer Group spins off a segment of its business, the shares of the spun-off entity will be treated as a cash dividend that is reinvested in the Company or the company in the Peer Group during that period. If, after the Adjustment Date during the Performance Period, the Company or a company in the Adjusted Peer Group spins off a segment of its business, the shares of the spun-off entity will be treated as a cash dividend that is reinvested in the Company or the company in the Adjusted Peer Group during that period. 

  


Total shareholder return for the entire performance period is the percentage change in the value of an investment in the common stock of a company from the initial investment made on the last trading day in the calendar year preceding the beginning of the performance period through the last trading day in the final year of the performance period. To the extent total shareholder return is calculated for a portion of the performance period ending on the Adjustment Date, it shall be the percentage change in the value of an investment in the common stock of a company from the initial investment made on the last trading day in the calendar year preceding the beginning of the performance period through the last trading day in the month in which occurs the Adjustment Date. To the extent total shareholder return is calculated for a portion of the performance period beginning on the day after the Adjustment Date, it shall be the percentage change in the value of an investment in the common stock of a company from the initial investment made on the last trading day in the month in which occurs the Adjustment Date through the last trading day in the final year of the performance period. It is assumed that dividends are reinvested in additional shares of common stock at the frequency paid.

  


All Performance Shares that are not earned for the Performance Period shall be forfeited. 

  


3\. Issuance of Shares and Mandatory Holding Period. Subject to any restrictions on distributions of Shares under the Plan, and subject to Section 6 of this Annex A, the Shares earned under the Award, if any, shall be issued to the Participant as soon as practicable (but no later than the next March 10) following the close of the Performance Period. The Participant shall retain 50% of the net after-tax Shares that are earned under this Award until the earlier of (i) the end of the two-year period commencing on the date any Shares earned under this Award are issued and (ii) the Participant’s termination of employment.
