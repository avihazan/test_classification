5\. 

Termination.  
  
  


a. 

Termination for Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment pursuant to this Agreement at any time for Cause and the termination will become effective immediately at the time the Company provides written notice to the Executive. If the Company decides to terminate the Executive’s employment under this Agreement for Cause, the Company will have no further obligations to make any payments to the Executive under this Agreement, except that the Executive will receive any unpaid accrued Base Salary through the date of termination of employment. Upon termination for Cause, the Executive will not be entitled to any annual bonus payments other than those becoming due and payable prior to the termination date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Cause” will mean:  
  
  


(i) 

The Executive’s arrest or conviction for, plea of nolo contendere to, or admission of the commission of, any act of fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement, or a criminal felony involving dishonesty or moral turpitude;  
  
  


(ii) 

A breach by the Executive of any material provision of this Agreement, provided that the Executive is given reasonable notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within thirty days of such notice (if such breach is curable), any such breach;  
  
  


(iii) 

Any act or intentional omission by the Executive involving dishonesty or moral turpitude;  
  
  


(iv) 

The Executive’s material failure to adequately perform his duties and responsibilities as such duties and responsibilities are, from time to time, in the Company’s discretion, determined and after reasonable notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within thirty days of such notice (if such breach is curable), any such breach; or  
  
  


(v) 

Any intentional independent act by the Executive that would cause the Company significant reputational injury.  
  
  


b. 

Death or Disability. This Agreement and the Company’s obligations under this Agreement will terminate upon the death or total disability of the Executive. For purposes of this Section 5.b, “total disability” means that for a period of six consecutive months the Executive is incapable of substantially fulfilling the duties set forth in this Agreement because of physical, mental or emotional incapacity as determined by an independent physician mutually acceptable to the Company and the Executive. If the Agreement terminates due to the death or disability of the Executive, the Company will pay the Executive or his legal representative any unpaid accrued Base Salary through the date of termination of employment (or, if terminated as a result of a disability, until the date upon which any disability policy maintained pursuant to Section 4 begins payment of benefits) plus any other compensation that may be earned and unpaid.  
  
  


c. 

Voluntary Termination. The Executive may elect to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to the Company sixty days prior to the date on which termination is elected; provided, however, that in the event of such termination, the Company may elect to accelerate the date of such termination to an earlier date if it so elects. If the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment the Company will have no further obligations to make payments under this Agreement, except that the Company will pay to the Executive any unpaid accrued Base Salary through the date of voluntary termination of employment. The Executive will not be entitled to any annual bonus payments other than those earned or becoming due and payable prior to the voluntary termination date.  
  
  


d. 

Termination Without Cause. If the Executive’s employment is terminated for any reason other than by death, disability, for Cause, or due to the Executive’s voluntary resignation of employment, the Company will have no further obligation to make payments under this Agreement, except (i) to the extent set forth in the award agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B with respect to the restricted Company common stock and (ii) that the Company will pay to the Executive an amount equal to 200% of then-current Base Salary in one lump sum payment on the forty-fifth day after the date of termination of the Executive’s employment, which shall be conditioned upon the delivery by the Executive of a release of claims reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall have not been revoked by the Executive pursuant to any revocation rights afforded by applicable law.  
  
  


e. 

Compliance with Section 409A. With respect to the payments provided by this Agreement upon termination of the Executive’s employment (the “Cash Severance Amount”), in the event the aggregate portion of the Cash Severance Amount payable during the first six months following the date of termination of the Executive’s employment would exceed an amount (the “Minimum Amount”) equal to two times the lesser of (i) the Executive’s annualized compensation as in effect for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the Executive’s termination of employment occurs, or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified retirement plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for the calendar year during which the Executive’s termination of employment occurs, then, to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income taxes or penalties or interest on the Executive under Section 409A of the Code, (x) the Company shall pay during the first six months following the date of termination of the Executive’s employment, at the time(s) and in the form(s) provided by the applicable sections of this Agreement, a portion of the Cash Severance Amount equal to the Minimum Amount, and (y) the Company shall accumulate the portion of the Cash Severance Amount that exceeds the Minimum Amount and that the Executive would otherwise be entitled to receive during the first six months following the date of termination of the Executive’s employment and shall pay such accumulated amount to the Executive in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination of the Executive’s employment, and (z) the Company shall pay the remainder of the Cash Severance Amount, if any, on and after the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination of the Executive’s employment at the time(s) and in the form(s) provided by the applicable section(s) of this Agreement.  
  
  


f. 

Compliance with Section 280G. If any payment or benefit due to the Executive from the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, would (if paid or provided) constitute an Excess Parachute Payment (as such term is used in Section 280G(b)(i) of the Code), then notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other commitment of the Company, that payment or benefit will be limited to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion thereof will fail to be tax-deductible to the Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The determination of whether any payment or benefit would (if paid or provided) constitute an Excess Parachute Payment will be made by the Company, in good faith and in its sole discretion. If multiple payments or benefits are subject to reduction under this Section 5.f, such payments or benefits will be reduced in the order that maximizes the Executive’s economic position (as determined by the Company in good faith, in its sole discretion). If, notwithstanding the initial application of this Section 5.f, the Internal Revenue Service determines that any payment or benefit provided to the Executive constituted an Excess Parachute Payment, this Section 5.f will be reapplied based on the Internal Revenue Service’s determination and the Executive will be required to promptly repay to the Company any amount in excess of the payment limit of this Section 5.f.  
  
  


g. 

Return of Company Property. Upon the termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company, the Executive shall leave with or promptly return to the Company all originals and copies of any documents, records, notebooks, files, correspondence, reports, memoranda or similar materials of or containing proprietary information, or other materials or property of any kind belonging to the Company (including keys and other tangible personal property of the Company), then in the Executive’s possession, whether prepared by the Executive or by others.  
  
  


6.

Discoveries, Inventions, Improvements and Other Intellectual Property. The Executive acknowledges that all worldwide rights to each discovery, invention or improvement which the Executive or the Company may develop, in whole or in part, during the term of this Agreement, whether patented or unpatented, which relate to or pertain to the business, functions or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, and arise (wholly or in part) from the efforts of the Executive during the term hereof, will be the exclusive property of the Company, regardless of whether such discoveries, inventions, improvements and other intellectual property was developed or worked on while the Executive was engaged in employment or whether the Executive developed or worked on such intellectual property on the Executive’s own time. The Company will own all rights to any copy, translation, modification, adaptation or derivation thereof and any product based thereon. The Executive acknowledges that a violation of this Section 6 would lead to irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages could not adequately compensate and further acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief along with other such remedies the Company may have.  
  
  


7.

Restrictive Covenants.  
  
  


a.

During the term of the Executive’s employment by the Company, the Executive shall submit to the Board all business, commercial and investment opportunities or offers presented to Executive or of which Executive becomes aware which relate to the scope of the current businesses engaged in by the Company (“Corporate Opportunities”).

Change in Control.  
  
  


a. 

For the purposes of this Agreement, a “Change in Control” means any of the following events: (i) any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the “Exchange Act”)) or group (as such term is defined in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan (or any related trust) of the Company or a subsidiary, becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting shares and other outstanding voting securities that are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (“Voting Securities”); or (ii) approval by the shareholders of the Company and consummation of either of the following: (A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation or similar transaction (any of the foregoing, a “Merger”) as a result of which the persons who were the respective beneficial owners of the outstanding common stock and/or the Voting Securities immediately before such Merger are not expected to beneficially own, immediately after such Merger, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively, the outstanding voting shares and the combined voting power of the voting securities resulting from such merger in substantially the same proportions as immediately before such Merger; or (B) a plan of liquidation of the Company or a plan or agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.  
  
  


b. 

The Company and the Executive agree that, if the Executive is in the employ of the Company on the date on which a Change in Control occurs (the “Change in Control Date”), the Company will continue to employ the Executive and the Executive will remain in the employ of the Company for the period commencing on the Change in Control Date and ending on the termination of his employment, to exercise such authority and perform such executive duties (including assistance in any transition matters designated by the Board following such Change in Control) as are commensurate with the authority being exercised and duties being performed by the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control Date.  
  
  


c. 

After the Change in Control Date, the Company will (i) continue to honor the terms of this Agreement, including as to Base Salary and other compensation set forth in Section 3, and (ii) continue employee benefits as set forth in Section 4 at levels in effect on the Change in Control Date (but subject to such reductions as may be required to maintain such plans in compliance with applicable federal law regulating employee benefits).  
  
  


d. 

If after the Change in Control Date, (i) the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause (as defined in Section 5.a above), or (ii) the Executive voluntarily terminates employment for Good Reason (as defined below), then the Executive will receive separation pay in an amount equal to 200% of then-current Base Salary in one lump sum payment on the forty-fifth day after the date of termination of the Executive's employment, which shall be conditioned upon the delivery by the Executive of a release of claims reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall have not been revoked by the Executive pursuant to any revocation rights afforded by applicable law. “Good Reason” shall mean a material reduction in the Executive’s compensation or employment related benefits, or a material change in the Executive’s status, working conditions or management responsibilities. The Executive's termination of employment will not constitute a termination for Good Reason unless the Executive first provides written notice to the Company of the existence of the Good Reason within sixty days following the effective date of the occurrence of the Good Reason, and the Good Reason remains uncorrected by the Company for more than thirty days following such written notice of the Good Reason from the Executive to the Company, and the effective date of the Executive’s termination of employment is within one year following the effective date of the occurrence of the Good Reason.

The Executive’s rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned or alienated and any attempt to do so by the Executive will be void and constitute a material breach hereunder.  
  
  


10.

Non-Coercion. The Executive represents and agrees that the Executive has not been pressured, misled, or induced to enter into this Agreement based upon any representation by the Company or its agents not contained herein.

Any section, paragraph, phrase or other provision of this Agreement that is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconscionable or in conflict with any applicable statute or rule, shall be deemed, if possible, to be modified or altered so that it is not unconscionable or in conflict with or, if that is not possible, then it shall be deemed omitted from this Agreement. The invalidity of any portion of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions.
