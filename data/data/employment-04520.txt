Exhibit 10.11



This Employment Agreement (the “Agreement”), is made effective March 29, 2006 (the “Effective Date”), between Heska Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Heska”) and Robert B. Grieve, Ph.D. (“Executive”).

RECITALS

Executive is currently the Chairman of Heska Board of Directors (the “Board”), and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Heska. Executive and Heska entered into an employment agreement dated February 23, 2000 (the “Prior Agreement”).

Executive and Heska now wish to enter into this new agreement regarding the terms of Executive’s employment, which shall become effective upon execution.

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the promises, covenants and agreements set forth below, it is mutually agreed:

## 1. Duties and Scope of Employment.

## 

### (a) Position and Duties. As of the Effective Date, Executive will continue to serve as CEO and Chairman of Heska. Executive will render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with Executive’s position within Heska, as will reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. The period of Executive’s employment under this Agreement is referred to herein as the “Term of Agreement.”

### 

### (b) Board Membership. At each meeting of Heska’s stockholders when Executive is up for Board election, Heska will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board. Executive’s service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Executive’s continuing service as Chairman will be subject to the discretion of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board, and any decision of the Board to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman will not affect or trigger any other provision of this Agreement.

### 

### (c) Obligations. During the Term of Agreement, Executive will devote Executive’s full business efforts and time to Heska. For the duration of the Term of Agreement, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the Board or the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Executive may, without the approval of the Board or the Corporate Governance Committee, serve in any capacity with any civic, educational or charitable organization, provided such services do not interfere with Executive’s obligations to Heska.

* * *

  


## 2. At-Will Employment. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 7 and 8 below, Executive and Heska agree that Executive’s employment constitutes “at-will” employment. Executive and Heska acknowledge that this employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written notice to the other party (which in the case of Heska will mean the Board), with or without good cause or for any or no cause, at the option either of Heska or Executive. However, as described in this Agreement, Executive will be entitled to severance benefits depending upon the circumstances of Executive’s termination of employment. In the event Heska terminates Executive’s employment for “Cause” as defined in Section 9(b) below, such written notice shall detail the reasons for termination. Upon the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, and without diminution, Executive will be entitled to payment of all accrued but unpaid compensation, vacation, expense reimbursements, and other benefits due to Executive through his termination date under any company-provided or paid plans, policies, and arrangements. Executive agrees to resign from all positions that he holds with Heska, including, without limitation, his position as a member of the Board, immediately following the termination of his employment if the Board so requests.

## 

## 3. Term of Agreement. This Agreement will have an initial term of three years commencing on the Effective Date. On the third anniversary of the Effective Date, and on each annual anniversary of the Effective Date thereafter, this Agreement automatically will renew for an additional one-year term unless Heska provides Executive with notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the date of automatic renewal.

## 

## 4. Cash Compensation; Vacation.

## 

### (a) Base Salary. During fiscal year 2006, Heska will pay Executive an annual salary of $341,000 as compensation for his services (the “Base Salary”). The Base Salary will be paid periodically in accordance with Heska’s normal payroll practices and be subject to the usual, required withholding. Executive’s salary will be subject to review, and adjustments will be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) based upon Heska’s standard practices.

### 

### (b) Annual Bonus. During the Term of Agreement, Executive will be eligible to participate in the Management Incentive Plan (the “Bonus Plan”), or such other bonus programs as established by the Committee, at a target percentage that is no less than 50% of Executive’s annual base salary then in effect (the “Target Bonus”). The actual bonus paid may be higher or lower than the Target Bonus for over or under-achievement of Executive’s performance goals, as determined by the Committee. Bonuses, if any, will accrue and become payable in accordance with the Committee’s standard practices for paying executive incentive compensation, provided however that any bonus payable under this Section 4(b) will be payable within two-and-one-half months after the end of the taxable year to which it relates or such longer period as may be permitted by Treasury regulations in order to avoid application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code to such bonuses.

### 

### (c) Vacation. Executive shall continue to accrue vacation and/or paid time off at the same rate and on the same compensation basis that he accrued vacation and/or paid time off as of January 1, 2006 (or at such greater rate that may, under Heska policy adopted from time to time, apply to Heska’s executive officers).

2

* * *

  


## 5. Expenses. In addition to the foregoing, Heska will reimburse Executive for his reasonable out-of-pocket travel, entertainment, and other expenses, in accordance with Heska’s expense reimbursement policies as in effect from time to time.

## 

## 6. Employee Benefits. During the Term of Agreement, Executive will be eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of all Heska employee benefit plans, policies, and arrangements that are applicable to other senior executives of Heska, as such plans, policies, and arrangements may exist from time to time.

## 

## 7. Severance.

## 

### (a) Termination without Cause or for Good Reason other than in connection with a Change of Control. If Executive’s employment is terminated by Heska without Cause, or by Executive for Good Reason, or is terminated due to the death or Disability (as defined in Section 9(e) below) of Executive, and the termination is not in connection with a Change of Control, Executive will receive subject to Section 8:

### 

#### (i) A payment of an amount equal to 12 months of his Base Salary, payable in accordance with Heska’s standard payroll practices over the shorter of the following periods (i) in equal installments over the period beginning on the date of such termination and ending on the one-year anniversary thereof, or (ii) in equal installments on a monthly basis corresponding to the amount he would normally receive as salary each month if he were still employed, with a lump sum of any remaining balance of the amount specified above on March 15 of the year following the year of termination.

#### 

#### (ii) Company-paid coverage for Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents under Heska’s Benefits Plans (as defined below) for 12 months, or if earlier, until Executive becomes employed by another employer who provides comparable benefits;

####

#### 

#### (iv) 12 months of accelerated vesting of equity awards held by Executive at the time of his termination. In addition, Executive will have until the later of December 31 of the calendar year in which, or the 15th day of the third month following the date, the award would otherwise (but for this Section 7(a)(iv)) have expired to exercise such award.

#### 

### (b) Termination without Cause or for Good Reason in connection with a Change of Control. If Executive’s employment is terminated by Heska without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason, and the termination is in Connection with a Change of Control, then, subject to Section 8, Executive will receive:

### 

#### (i) A payment of an amount equal to 24 months of his Base Salary, payable in equal installments in accordance with the standard payroll schedule over the 

3

* * *

  


#### shorter of the following periods (i) the period beginning on the date of such termination and ending on the one-year anniversary thereof, or (ii) the period beginning on the date of such termination and ending on March 15 of the year following the year of termination;

####

#### 

#### (iii) Company-paid coverage for Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents under Heska’s Benefits Plans for 24 months following the termination date, or if earlier, until Executive becomes employed by another employer who provides comparable benefits; and

#### 

#### (iv) Full (100%) acceleration of vesting of any unvested equity awards held by Executive at the time of his termination. In addition, to the extent such awards are not (after taking into account such accelerated vesting) terminated in connection with the closing of the Change of Control, then Executive will have until the later of December 31 of the calendar year in which, or the 15th day of the third month following the date, the award would otherwise (but for this Section 7(b)(iv)) have expired to exercise such award.

#### 

### (c) Voluntary Termination without Good Reason; Termination for Cause. If Executive’s employment with Heska terminates voluntarily by Executive without Good Reason or is terminated for Cause by Heska, then (i) all further vesting of Executive’s outstanding equity awards will terminate immediately, (ii) all payments of compensation by Heska to Executive hereunder will terminate immediately (except as to amounts already earned), and (iii) Executive will not be entitled to any severance but Executive will be paid all accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements and other benefits due to Executive through his termination date under any Company-provided or paid plans, policies, and arrangements.

### 

### (d) Reformation of Agreement. It is the parties’ intent that no payment made or to be made hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, notwithstanding any payment date or schedule specified above, the parties agree to work expeditiously to amend this Agreement to conform to their intent as set forth in this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary, to the extent that Heska in good faith determines that any payment provided for in this Section 7 constitutes a “deferral of compensation” under Code Section 409A, no amounts shall be payable to Executive prior to the earliest of (a) Executive’s death or “disability” (within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(C)) following the termination date, (b) the date that is six months following the date of Executive’s “separation from service” with the Company (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), or (c) the effective date of a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (in each case within the meaning of Code Section 409A).

### 

### (e) Excise Tax. In the event that any benefits payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement (“Termination Benefits”) (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, or any comparable successor provisions, 

4

* * *

  


### and (ii) but for this Section 7(e) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any comparable successor provisions (the “Excise Tax”), then Executive’s Termination Benefits hereunder shall be either (a) provided to Executive in full, or (b) provided to Executive as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax, and any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under the Excise Tax. Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 7(e) shall be made in writing in good faith by the Company’s independent accountants. In the event of a reduction of benefits hereunder, Executive shall be given the choice of which benefits to reduce. If Executive does not provide written identification to the Company of which benefits he chooses to reduce within ten (10) days after written notice of the accountants’ determination, and Executive has not disputed the accountants’ determination, then the Company shall select the benefits to be reduced. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 7(e), the accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code, and other applicable legal authority. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 7(e). The Company shall bear all costs the accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 7(e).

### 

## 8. Conditions to Receipt of Severance; No Duty to Mitigate.

## 

### (a) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims. The receipt of any severance pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to Heska. Such agreement will provide (among other things) that the Parties will not disparage each other or the Company, its directors, or its executive officers. No severance will be paid or provided until the separation agreement and release agreement becomes effective which shall be prepared and executed before the termination date.

### 

### (b) Non-Competition. In the event of a termination of Executive’s employment that otherwise would entitle Executive to the receipt of severance pursuant to Section 7(b), Executive agrees not to engage in Competition (as defined below) for 12 months following the termination date. If Executive engages in Competition within such period all continuing payments and benefits to which Executive otherwise may be entitled pursuant to Section 7(b) will cease immediately. In addition to the remedy specified in the preceding sentence, the Company will have against Executive in the event of his breach of this Section 8(b) any and all remedies available to it in law or in equity, including without limitation the right to seek recovery of any amounts paid under Section 7 of this Agreement.

### 

### (c) Nonsolicitation. In the event of a termination of Executive’s employment that otherwise would entitle Executive to the receipt of severance pursuant to Section 7, Executive agrees that, for 24 months following the termination date, Executive, directly or indirectly, whether as employee, owner, sole proprietor, partner, director, member, consultant, 

5

### agent, founder, co-venturer or otherwise, (i) will not solicit, induce, or influence any person to modify his or her employment or consulting relationship with the Company (the “No-Inducement”), and (ii) not intentionally divert business away from the Company by soliciting business from any of the Company’s substantial customers and users who would otherwise have placed the solicited order with the Company (the “No Solicit”). If Executive breaches the No-Inducement or No Solicit, all continuing payments and benefits to which Executive otherwise may be entitled pursuant to Section 7 will cease immediately. In addition to the remedy specified in the preceding sentence, the Company will have against Executive in the event of his breach of this Section 8(c) any and all remedies available to it in law or in equity, including without limitation the right to seek recovery of any amounts paid under Section 7 of this Agreement.

### 

### (d) No Duty to Mitigate. Executive is under no duty or requirement to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor will any earnings that Executive may receive from any other source reduce any such payment.

A requirement that Heska provide Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents with coverage under the Benefit Plans will not be satisfied unless the coverage is no less favorable than that provided to Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents immediately prior to Executive’s termination of employment. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, Heska, or its successor, may, at its option, satisfy any requirement that Heska provide coverage under any Benefit Plan by instead providing coverage under a separate plan or plans providing coverage that is no less favorable or by paying Executive a lump-sum payment which is, on an after-tax basis, sufficient to provide Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents with equivalent coverage under a third party plan that is reasonably available to Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 9(d) or in Section 8(b) above shall prohibit Executive from being employed or engaged in a corporate function or senior management position (and holding commensurate equity interests) with a Restricted Company that is engaged in multiple lines of business, one of which includes a Restricted Division, so long as Executive does not provide to the Restricted Division services of a sort that differ significantly from the services he provides to the other divisions, units or affiliates for which he has responsibility within the overall organization.
