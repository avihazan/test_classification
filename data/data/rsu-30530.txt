1\. General. The shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Award Agreement are granted as of June 17, 2005 (the “Award Date”) pursuant to and subject to all of the provisions hereof and of the Plan applicable to Restricted Stock granted pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan, which provisions are, unless otherwise provided herein, incorporated by reference and made a part hereof to the same extent as if set forth in their entirety herein, and to such other terms necessary or appropriate to the grant hereof having been made.

6\. Applicable Law.

8\. Waiver. The waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Award Agreement by Participant shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Participant.

  


9\. Binding Effect. The provisions of this Award Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors and assigns, including, without limitation, the Company, its successors or assigns, the estate of the Participant and the executors, administrators or trustees of such estate and any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the creditors of the Participant.

  


10\. Withholding. Participant agrees, as a condition of this grant, to make acceptable arrangements to pay any withholding or other taxes that may be due as a result of the vesting of the Restricted Shares acquired under this grant. In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, local or foreign tax or withholding payment is required relating to the vesting of shares arising from this grant, the Company shall have the right to require such payments from Participant, or withhold such amounts from other payments due Participant from the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.

  


11\. Taxes.

Participant understands that Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Participant’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of this grant or the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement. Participant understands that Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), taxes as ordinary income the difference between the purchase price for the Restricted Shares and the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Restricted Shares lapse. Participant may elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Shares are granted rather than when the date any restrictions on the Restricted Shares lapse by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date hereof. THE FORM FOR MAKING THIS ELECTION IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT A HERETO.  
  
PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE PARTICIPANT’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY’S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER CODE SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF THE PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEGAL COUNSEL) TO MAKE THIS FILING ON THE PARTICIPANT’S BEHALF.

  


12\. No Retention Rights. Nothing herein contained shall confer on the Participant any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or its Affiliates, or interfere with the right of the Company or its Affiliates to terminate at any time the employment of the Participant.

In the event of any conflict between the provisions hereof and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern.
