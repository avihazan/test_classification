TERMINATION OF AWARD

5. Termination of Service on the Board. If an Awardee’s service on the Board terminates for any reason, the restrictions and risk of forfeiture with respect to the Restricted Stock which have not expired shall immediately expire and all shares of the Restricted Stock shall be fully vested.

6. Change in Control or Potential Change in Control of the Company. In the event of a Change in Control, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in writing after the Grant Date, but prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, or, in the event of a Potential Change in Control, if and to the extent so determined by the Committee in writing after the Grant Date (subject to any right of approval expressly reserved by the Committee at the time of such determination): (a) the restrictions with respect to the Restricted Stock shall expire and such shares shall be deemed fully vested; and (b) the value of the outstanding Stock previously subject to restrictions, shall, to the extent determined by the Committee at or after the Grant Date, be settled on the basis of the Change in Control Price as of the date the Change in Control occurs or Potential Change in Control is determined to have occurred, or such other date as the Committee may determine prior to the Change in Control or Potential Change in Control. In the sole discretion of the Committee, such settlements may be made in cash or in stock, as shall be necessary to effect the desired accounting treatment for the transaction resulting in the Change in Control or Potential Change of Control.

7. No Limitation on Excess Parachute Payments. The provisions of Section 14 of the Plan regarding the payment of any “Excess Parachute Payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall not apply to this Agreement.

GENERAL TERMS AND PROVISIONS

8. Administration of Award. The Restricted Stock shall be maintained in a book-entry account (the “Account”) by and at the Company’s transfer agent until the restrictions associated with such Restricted Stock expire pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6. The Awardee shall execute and deliver to the transfer agent one or more stock powers in blank for the Restricted Stock. The Awardee hereby agrees that the transfer agent shall maintain such Account and the related stock power(s) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until such restrictions expire pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6.

9. Ownership of Restricted Stock. From and after the time that the Account representing the Restricted Stock has been activated and prior to forfeiture, the Awardee will be entitled to all the rights of absolute ownership of the Restricted Stock, including the right to vote those shares and to receive dividends thereon if, as, and when declared by the Board, subject, however, to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement. Dividends paid in stock of the Company or stock received in connection with a Stock split with respect to the Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as on such Restricted Stock. The shares

of Restricted Stock subject to this Award are not eligible to be enrolled in any dividend re-investment program until the restrictions thereon expire.

10. Adjustment of Shares for Recapitalization, Etc. In the event there is any change in the outstanding Stock of the Company by reason of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares or otherwise, there shall be substituted for or added to each share of Stock theretofore appropriated or thereafter subject, or which may become subject, to this Award, the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities into which each outstanding share of Stock shall be so changed or for which each such share shall be exchanged, or to which each such share shall be entitled, as the case may be. Adjustment under the preceding provisions of this Section 10 will occur automatically upon any such change in the outstanding Stock of the Company. No fractional interest will be issued under the Plan on account of any such adjustment.

11. Conditions to Delivery of Stock and Registration. Nothing herein shall require the Company to issue or the transfer agent to deliver any shares with respect to the Award if (a) that issuance would, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, constitute a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any similar or superseding statute or statutes, any other applicable statute or regulation, or the rules of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect. From time to time, the Board and appropriate officers of the Company are authorized to and shall take whatever actions are necessary to file required documents with governmental authorities, stock exchanges, and other appropriate persons to make shares of Stock available for issuance.

12. Payment of Taxes. The delivery of shares of Stock pursuant to this Award is conditioned upon satisfaction of any withholding obligation described in this Section 12. The Awardee may be required, from time to time, in the Company’s discretion, to pay to the Company (or any Subsidiary or Affiliate as applicable), the amount that the Company deems necessary to satisfy the Company’s or its Subsidiary’s or Affiliate’s current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by the Awardee as a result of the Award. With respect to any required tax withholding, the Awardee may (a) upon election at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Company, direct the Company to purchase from the Awardee the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be issued upon vesting equal in value to the amount of such obligation, based on the shares’ Fair Market Value at the time such obligation is incurred; (b) deliver to the Company sufficient shares of Stock to satisfy such obligations, based on the shares’ Fair Market Value at the time such obligation is incurred; or (c) deliver sufficient cash to the Company to satisfy such obligations. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deny any request to satisfy withholding obligations through Stock instead of cash. In the event the Company subsequently determines that the aggregate Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld as payment of any tax withholding obligation is insufficient to discharge that tax withholding obligation, then the Awardee shall pay to the Company, immediately upon the Company’s request, the amount of that deficiency in cash.
