(b)

Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 3, (i) if the Performance Shares Earned under Paragraph 7(a) are not assumed or substituted by the successor to the Company (or an affiliate), such Performance Shares shall be converted to a non-forfeitable right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of the Change in Control times the number of Performance Shares Earned, and, unless the Company elects to terminate this Award (to the extent permitted by section 409A of the Code), the Award will be accumulated with interest from the date of the Change in Control until the payment date at a rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of the Code for the month in which the Change in Control occurs), and such amount shall be paid at the time of payment specified under Paragraph 4; and (ii) if the Performance Shares Earned under Paragraph 7(a) are assumed or substituted, such Performance Shares shall be converted to restricted stock units (in an amount equal to the number of Performance Shares Earned, adjusted under Paragraph 15), which shall become non-forfeitable if the Employee remains employed until the last day of the Award Cycle or until the award becomes non-forfeitable under Paragraph 5, or, if, during the remainder of the Award Cycle, the Employee incurs a Termination of Employment by the Company without Cause (and, in such case, the Award shall become non-forfeitable without proration), and in each case the restricted stock units, to the extent non-forfeitable, shall be settled at the time specified under Paragraph 4 in cash or shares.  
  
  
  
  
(c)

Distributions to the Employee under Paragraph 3 shall not be affected by payments under this Paragraph 7, except that before distributions are made under Paragraph 3, and after all computations required under Paragraph 3 have been made, the number of Performance Shares Earned by the Employee shall be reduced by the number of Performance Shares Earned with respect to which payment was made to the Employee under this Paragraph 7.  
  
  
  
  
(d)

The Employee shall not be required to repay any amounts to the Company on account of any distribution made under this Paragraph 7 for any reason, including failure to achieve the Performance Goal, other than as provided in Paragraph 8.

Instead, the covenants below shall supplement and be independent of any such rights.

The Employee also acknowledges that his or her employment may place him or her in contact, and in a position of trust, with customers of the Company or its Affiliates, and that in the course of employment the Employee may be given access to and asked to maintain and develop relationships with such customers. The Employee acknowledges that such Confidential Information and customer relationships are of substantial value to the Company and its Affiliates, that this award of the Performance Award is designed to induce the Company and its Affiliates to share Confidential Information with the Employee and to further create incentives for the Employee to develop goodwill through customer relationships, and that it is reasonable for the Company to seek to prevent the Employee from giving competitors unfair access to Confidential Information and customer relationships.

(h)

Noninterference with Business Relationships. Prior to and through a one-year period following the Termination of Employment date, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, disrupt, or attempt to interfere with or disrupt, the business relationship between the Company or any of its Affiliates and any of its customers, suppliers, or employees.  
  
  
  
  
(i)

Expiration of the Performance Award.

7

  


* * *

  


Paragraphs 12(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this Agreement independently relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants, obligations or agreements will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, the Employee agrees that the Company and any of its Affiliate(s) that employed the Employee shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain the Employee from committing any violation of such covenants, obligations, or agreements. These injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies that the Company or its Affiliates may have.

Jurisdiction. With respect to all disputes under this Paragraph 12, the Company and the Employee hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the state or jurisdiction where the Employee’s primary office is located (or, if litigation is brought after the Termination of Employment date, where the Employee’s most recent primary office was located), except if such location is outside of the United States, the Company and the Employee hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Delaware. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably agree that (i) the sole and exclusive appropriate venue for any suit or proceeding relating to such matters shall be in such a court, (ii) all claims with respect to any such matters shall be heard and determined exclusively in such court, (iii) such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute, and (iv) each hereby waives any and all objections and defenses based on forum, venue or personal or subject matter jurisdiction as they may relate to any suit or proceeding brought before such a court in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 12.  
  
(l) Additional Acknowledgements. The Employee acknowledges that:

  
  
  
(i)

the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained by Paragraph 12 are reasonable and acceptable to the Employee, and do not impose any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to protect the trade secrets and other Confidential Information, goodwill, and other legitimate business interests of the Company and its Affiliates; and  
  
  
  
  
(ii)

the performance by the Employee of the covenants and agreements contained herein, and the enforcement by the Company of the provisions contained herein, will cause no undue hardship on the Employee.  
  
  


13.Taxes and Withholdings. No later than the applicable distribution date for any distribution of shares and/or cash made under Paragraph 3, the Employee shall pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of any federal,

In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization (including, but not limited to, a change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding), or a corporate transaction, such as any merger, consolidation, separation, or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, the number and kind of Performance Shares subject to the award may be adjusted by the Board or Committee as the Board or Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Performance Shares subject to the award shall always be a whole number. The determination of the Board or Committee regarding any adjustment will be final and conclusive.

Other Executive Officers: Two and one-half times annual salary. Until the two and one-half times annual salary requirement has been met, the executive is required to retain shares of Common Stock having a market value at least equal to 25% of the pre-tax compensation realized upon settlement of any restricted stock units, payment of any performance shares, exercise of any stock options or settlement of any other stock awards. After the two and one-half times annual salary requirement has been met, the executive is required to retain, at the retention rate specified in the preceding sentence, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock from subsequent settlements of restricted stock units, payments of performance shares, exercises of stock options and settlements of other stock awards as may be necessary at that time to satisfy the two and one-half times annual salary requirement.  
  
•

Each executive shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock (i) until the respective ownership requirement has been met or (ii) after the respective ownership requirement has been met, to the extent that the executive would no longer satisfy the ownership requirement immediately following such sale, transfer or other disposition.
