-5-

* * *

case, the provisions of paragraph 8 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination of Executive's employment hereunder:

6.1.

By Employer  
  
With or without Cause (as defined below), Employer may terminate the employment of Executive at any time during the term of employment upon giving Executive at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof. The effective date of the termination of Executive's employment shall be the date on which such applicable 30-day period expires; provided, however, that Employer may, upon notice to Executive and without reducing Executive's annual base salary during such 30-day period, excuse Executive from any or all of his duties during such period and request Executive to immediately resign as a Director, if applicable, and officer of Employer, whereupon, if requested to so resign, Executive shall immediately resign. 

6.2.

By Executive  
  
Executive may terminate his employment at any time upon giving Employer, in the case of termination by Executive (a) other than with Good Reason, at least 90 days' prior written notice thereof and (b) with Good Reason, at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof.

This Agreement and Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate automatically upon the death or total disability of Executive. The term "total disability" as used herein shall mean Executive's inability to perform the duties set forth in paragraph 1 hereof, with or without reasonable accommodation, for a period or periods aggregating 120 calendar days in any 12-month period as a result of physical or mental illness, loss of legal capacity or any other cause beyond Executive's control, unless Executive is granted a leave of absence by the Board of Directors.

Termination hereunder shall be deemed to be effective immediately upon Executive's death or a determination by the Board of Directors of Executive's total disability, as defined herein.
