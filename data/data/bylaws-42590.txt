C. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Company shall indemnify any individual who is, was or is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding (including a proceeding by or in the right of the Company) because he is or was a director or officer of the Company or because he is or was serving the Company or any other legal entity in any capacity at the request of the Company while a director or officer of the Company, against all liabilities and reasonable expenses incurred in the proceeding except such liabilities and expenses as are incurred because of his willful misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal law.
