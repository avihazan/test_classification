or the Escrow Agreement by the Purchaser or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by the Purchaser.

4.2 No Conflict. The performance of this Agreement, the Loan Agreement or the Escrow Agreement by the Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (i) the Certificate of Formation or the Operating Agreement of the Purchaser or (ii) any contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Purchaser is a party.

4.4 Restricted Securities. The Purchaser understands that the B Preferred Stock, the Company Option and any Common Stock received upon conversion of the B Preferred Stock or the exercise of the Company Option is characterized as “restricted securities” under the Securities Act inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under the Securities Act and applicable regulations thereunder such B Preferred Stock, Company Option and any Common Stock received upon conversion of the B Preferred Stock or the exercise of the Company Option may be resold
