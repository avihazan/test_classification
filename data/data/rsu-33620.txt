APPENDIX A

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

1\. Grant. The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan an award of that number of RSUs set forth on the first page of this Agreement, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. 

2\. Plan Governs. The RSUs are issued pursuant to, and the terms of this Agreement are subject to, all terms and provisions of the Plan, including without limitation Section 15 of the Plan. Except as provided in paragraph 4(b) below, in the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. 

3\. Company’s Obligation to Pay. Each RSU has a value equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the shares subject thereto are distributed. Unless and until the RSUs will have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5, the Employee will have no right to payment of any such RSUs. Prior to actual payment of any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or fiduciary relationship between Employee and the Company or any other person. 

4\. Vesting. 

(a) Subject to paragraph 5, the RSUs awarded by this Agreement will vest in the Employee according to the Vesting Schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement, subject to the Employee’s remaining in Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant through such vesting periods or dates. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Plan, the vesting of the RSUs awarded by this Agreement shall not accelerate in accordance with Section 9(d) of the Plan in connection with a termination of Employee’s Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of Employee’s retirement from the Company. 

(c) In the event of a Change in Control of the Company approved by the majority of the members of the Board on the Board prior to the commencement of such Change in Control, the RSUs shall be assumed or an equivalent award or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation; provided, however, in the event that within one year of the date of the completion of the Change in Control, the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation terminates the Employee without Cause, the RSUs shall become immediately fully vested. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute the RSUs, the RSUs shall become immediately fully vested and the shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued to Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control, provided that such transaction also qualifies as a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, in each case for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and other guidance thereunder (“Section 409A Change of Control”). 

(d) In the event of a Change in Control which is not approved by the majority of the members of the Board on the Board prior to the commencement of a Change in Control, the RSUs shall immediately fully vest. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute the RSUs, the shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued to Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control , provided that such transaction also qualifies as a Section 409A Change of Control. 

(e) The RSUs shall be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the RSUs confer the right to receive, for each Share of Common Stock subject to the RSUs immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Board may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be issued pursuant to the RSUs, for each Share of Common Stock subject to the RSUs, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 

5\. Forfeiture upon Termination as Service Provider. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if the Employee terminates Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant for any or no reason, the then-unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and the Employee shall have no further rights thereunder. To the extent not already paid, RSUs that vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule shall be paid following the Employee’s termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant in accordance with paragraph 6 or 8 below, as applicable. 

* * *

##### 

6\. Issuance after Vesting. If Employee does not elect to defer his or her distribution of the shares subject to the RSUs in accordance with paragraph 8 below, shares of Common Stock subject to any RSUs that vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule will be issued to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in whole shares of Common Stock on each of the thirteen (13), twenty-four (24) and thirty-six (36) month anniversaries of the Effective Date (each a “Vesting Distribution Date”), in each case not later than ten (10) days following each Vesting Distribution Date, with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to those RSUs that have vested on each such date. 

7\. Tax Withholding. On or before the time Employee receives a distribution of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the RSUs, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Employee must make adequate provision, as determined by the Company, for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or a Subsidiary, if any, which arise in connection with the vesting and/or issuance of the shares subject to the RSUs. Unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or any Subsidiary are satisfied, the Company shall have no obligation to issue the shares of Common Stock subject to the RSU. If the Employee does not satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or any Subsidiary within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from the Company, then the RSU will automatically terminate and the Employee will not be issued any shares pursuant to the RSU. 

8\. Deferral Election. 

(a) Election Whether to Defer Distribution of RSU Shares. Each Employee must elect whether to defer his or her distribution of the RSU shares to a date following the Vesting Distribution Date in accordance with paragraph 8(b) or 8(c) below, as applicable. Employees who are not eligible to participate in the Amended and Restated Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), as amended, must make an election pursuant to paragraph 8(b) below. Employees who are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan (“Selected Employees”) must make an election pursuant to paragraph 8(c) below. If an Employee does not make a valid, timely election pursuant to paragraph 8(b) or 8(c) below, as applicable, the Employee will be deemed to have affirmatively elected not to defer his or her distribution of the RSU shares, and the shares will be delivered to Employee in accordance with paragraph 6. 

(b) Standard Deferral Election. Employees who are not Selected Employees must make an election whether to defer receipt of the RSU shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Standard Deferral Election Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A. Subject to a valid deferral election made within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the Employee may elect to defer the timing of the receipt of shares under this Agreement and have such shares issued at a later date pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Standard Deferral Election Agreement. Such deferral elections must also comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the related Treasury Regulations or other guidance issued thereunder. 

(c) Deferral Election Under Deferred Compensation Plan by Selected Employees. Selected Employees must make an election whether to defer receipt of the RSU shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan Deferral Election Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B. Subject to a valid deferral election made within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, Selected Employees may elect to defer the timing of the receipt of the shares under this Agreement and have such shares issued at a later date pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan Deferral Election Agreement. Such deferral elections must also comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the related Treasury Regulations or other guidance issued thereunder. To make a valid deferral election pursuant to this paragraph 8(c), Employee must also complete a Deferred Compensation Plan Beneficiary Designation form, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. 

(d) Deferred Distribution Date. The date upon which the shares of Common Stock are scheduled to be delivered pursuant to any deferral election made under this paragraph 8 is the “Deferred Distribution Date.” Shares of Common Stock subject to any RSUs that are subject to any deferral election made under this paragraph 8 will be issued to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in whole shares of Common Stock in each case not later than ten (10) days following the Deferred Distribution Date 

9\. Delay in Issuance of Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the Company determines that the Employee’s sale of shares of Common Stock on the date the shares subject to the RSUs are scheduled to be delivered, whether on the Vesting Distribution Date or a Deferred Distribution Date selected pursuant to paragraph 8 above (in either case, the “Original Distribution Date”) would violate its policy regarding insider trading of the Company’s stock, as determined by the Company in accordance with such policy, then such shares shall not be delivered on such Original Distribution Date and shall instead be delivered as soon as practicable on or after the earliest date on which the Employee could sell such shares pursuant to such policy; provided, however, that in no event shall the delivery of the shares be delayed pursuant to this provision beyond the later of: (1) December 31st of the same calendar year of the Original Distribution Date, or (2) the 15th day of the third calendar month following the Original Distribution Date.

11\. No Effect on Employment. This Agreement is not an employment contract, and nothing herein shall be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any obligation on the Employee’s part to continue in the employ of the Company, or of the Company to continue the Employee’s employment with the Company. The Employee’s employment with the Company is on an at will basis only. The Company will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause.

Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company at its principal place of business (attention: General Counsel), or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing. Any notices provided for in this Agreement or the Plan shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to the Employee, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Employee at the address specified on the first page of this Agreement or at such other address as the Employee may hereafter designate by written notice to the Company. 

13\. Transferability. Unless determined otherwise by the Board, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby, including without limitation the shares of Common Stock issuable following the vesting of the RSUs, will not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process until, with respect to whole shares of Common Stock issuable following the vesting of the RSUs, such shares are issued pursuant to paragraph 6 or 8 above. Upon any attempt to sell, pledge, assign, hypothecate, transfer, or dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.

15\. Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock. If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares of Common Stock upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Employee (or his or her estate), such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.

However, if prior to such Deferred Distribution Date, there is a termination of Employee’s service with the Company that is a “separation from service” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, Employee will receive all shares of vested Common Stock associated with the RSUs in accordance with Employee’s election under Deferral Alternative #1, notwithstanding any deferral election Employee makes on this Election Agreement under Alternative #2 to receive shares on a specified date.  
4. If no Deferred Distribution Date is elected, then the issuance of vested Common Stock will occur upon or about the vesting date(s) as indicated in the RSU Agreement.  
5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if at the time the shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issued to Employee as a result of termination of service, Employee is subject to the distribution limitations contained in Section 409A of the Code applicable to “specified employees,” share issuances resulting from a termination of service shall not be made before the date which is six (6) months following the date of termination of Employee’s service, or, if earlier, the date of Employee’s death that occurs within such six (6) month period.
