Bokserska 66A, 02-690 Warsaw, Poland, with registration number 0000051098 (the “Borrower”). 

WHEREAS: 

(A) As of the date of this Agreement, the Lender has issued EUR 50,000,000 in 8.875% senior secured notes due in 2016 (the “Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated 2 December 2009 as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated 29 December 2009 and the second supplemental indenture dated 7 December 2010 (the indenture, as so supplemented, the “Indenture”), among the Lender, the Borrower, Central European Distribution Corporation (the “Parent”), certain subsidiaries of Parent as guarantors (together with Parent, the “Guarantors”), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited as trustee, Deutsche Trust Company Americas and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as registrar, transfer and paying agent, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as principal paying agent and Polish Security Agent and TMF Trustee Limited as global security agent. The price for the Notes at issue has been established at EUR 51,312,500.00.   
  
(B) Pursuant to a purchase agreement dated 6 December 2010 between the Lender, Parent, the Guarantors and Citigroup Global Markets Limited as representative of the several parties named in Schedule 1 thereto, the Lender is obliged to pay the underwriting commission amounting to 0.6% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which is EUR 3,000,000 (the “Fees”).   
  
(C) The Lender intends to grant to the Borrower a loan in the amount of EUR 51,108,861.11 (the “Loan”) from the proceeds obtained by the Lender from the issuance of the Notes.   
  
Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. 

NOW, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 

* * *

ARTICLE 1 

THE LOAN 

1.1 The Loan shall be made in one advance and paid to the Borrower on the date of this Agreement. The Loan shall be paid to such accounts as the Borrower shall specify to the Lender in writing.   
  
1.2 The Loan shall be executed in the form of a bank transfer made from the Lender’s bank accounts.   
  
ARTICLE 2 

INTEREST 

2.1 For the purposes of this Article 2 only “Loan” shall mean the aggregate of the Loan divided by 0.99361 and an amount equal to the Fees attributable to the Loan.   
  
2.2 Interest on the Loan shall accrue from the date of this Agreement until the repayment of the Loan and shall be paid at the rate of 8.875% per annum.   
  
2.3 Accrued interest on the Loan shall be payable in arrears in immediately available funds not later than May 31 and November 30 of each year and in any event on such date as the Lender shall reasonably request such that the Lender shall be able to comply with its obligations to make corresponding payments in respect of the Notes. The first such interest payments shall be made on or before May 31, 2011.   
  
2.4 If the rate of interest on the Notes increases pursuant to the terms of the Indenture: (i) the rate of interest on the Loan, as the case may be, shall increase automatically by the same percentage; and (ii) the Borrower will pay to the Lender, to cover such increase in interest rate, an amount equal to the additional rate required pursuant to the Indenture.   
  
ARTICLE 3 

REPAYMENT 

3.1

The Loan (together with all costs thereon) shall mature and be repaid in full on November 30, 2016. In the event that the entire principal amount of the Notes (or a portion of the principal the Notes) is due and payable prior to their stated maturity (whether due to a redemption or offer of payment of the Notes, a declaration of acceleration of the stated maturity date of the Notes or otherwise), the Borrower shall, promptly after demand by the Lender, repay a principal amount of the Loan, as the case may be, under this Agreement, together with the accrued interest, premiums in respect of the Notes (if any) and the amounts of any fees, costs and expenses as are due and payable under Article 4 as determined and allocated by the Lender in its absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, no prepayment of the Loan (whether in whole or in part) shall be permitted unless a corresponding prepayment of the Notes, as the case may be, is made concurrently therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any similar loan agreement, the Lender shall make such demand for repayment under such agreements in its discretion, provided, however, that it shall obtain from the aggregate of such demands

* * *

an amount sufficient to discharge its corresponding payment obligations in respect of the Notes.   
  
3.2 In the event of: (a) a declaration of an acceleration of the stated maturity of the Notes (to the extent such declaration has not been rescinded); (b) the failure by the Borrower to make a repayment of the Loan by any date specified in Section 3.1; or (c) upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, then at any time thereafter the Lender may, in its absolute discretion, by notice in writing to the Borrower cancel the Loan and declare the Loan to be immediately due and payable together with all interest, fees and other amounts payable hereunder and upon such declaration such sums shall become immediately due without further demand.   
  
ARTICLE 4 

FEES AND EXPENSES 

4.1 The Borrower shall pay to the Lender on the maturity date such costs, expenses, fees (including the Fees) and taxes (including legal and out-of-pocket expenses) determined by the Lender in its absolute discretion to be attributable to the Loan and incurred by the Lender in contemplation of, or otherwise in connection with: (i) the Notes; and (ii) the enforcement of any rights under this Agreement from the date on which such expenses were incurred to the date of payment (as well after as before judgment). The Borrower also agrees to pay on demand to the Lender an amount equal to the amounts required to be paid in satisfaction of franchise taxes and other amounts required to be paid (or advisable) to maintain corporate existence or in satisfaction of reasonable accounting, legal, management and administrative expenses.   
  
4.2 All expenses payable pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be paid together with Value Added Tax (if any) thereon.

PAYMENTS 

5.1 If any payment under this Agreement falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, the period (or the date for payment) shall be extended to end on the next succeeding Business Day. There a date for payment is altered under this Section, interest shall be re-calculated accordingly.   
  
5.2 All payments by the Borrower shall be made in immediately available funds to such account as it may specify in writing, and free and clear of any present or future tax, withholding or other deduction, unconditionally and without any set-off or counter-claim whatsoever, save for any deduction which the Borrower is required to make by law.   
  
5.3 All payments by the Borrower in respect of the Loan shall be made in Euro only.

5.4 If the Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or withhold any amounts, it shall pay to the Lender such additional amount as makes the net amount received by the Lender equal to the full amount payable if there had been no deduction or withholding. The Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Lender any receipts or other proof evidencing the amounts deducted or withheld from the amounts payable to the Lender.   
  
ARTICLE 6

The rights and remedies herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law.
