Upon the lapse of restrictions on shares of Restricted Stock, CenturyTel may, in its discretion, issue the vested shares of Restricted Stock (either through book-entry issuances or delivery of a stock certificate) in the name of the Award Recipient or his or her nominee within 30 days, subject to the other terms and conditions hereof. Upon the lapse of such restrictions, the Award Recipient is free to hold or dispose of the newly-issued shares, subject to (i) applicable securities laws, (ii) CenturyTel’s insider trading policy and (iii) any applicable stock retention policies that CenturyTel may adopt in the future.

6\. MISCELLANEOUS

Section 6.1 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if, at any time prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock in accordance with Section 1 or 2 hereof, CenturyTel further determines, in its sole discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification (or any updating of any such document) of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant hereto is necessary on any securities exchange or under any federal or state securities or blue sky law, or that the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, or the removal of any restrictions imposed on such shares, such shares of Common Stock shall not be issued, in whole or in part, or the restrictions thereon removed, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions unacceptable to CenturyTel. CenturyTel agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to issue all shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the terms provided herein.

Section 6.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Award Recipient any right to continue to serve on the Board, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company to remove the Award Recipient as a director at any time.

Section 6.3 Upon being duly executed and delivered by CenturyTel and the Award Recipient, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives and successors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, whenever the term “Award Recipient” is used in any provision of this Agreement under circumstances where the provision appropriately applies to the heirs, executors, administrators or legal representatives to whom this award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, the term “Award Recipient” shall be deemed to include such person or persons.

Section 6.4 The shares of Restricted Stock granted hereby are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and other provisions of the Plan as fully as if all such provisions were set forth in their entirety in this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Plan, the Plan provision shall control, except that the provisions of Section 2.2(c) shall prevail over any contrary provisions in the Plan. The Award Recipient acknowledges receipt from CenturyTel of a copy of the Plan and a prospectus summarizing the Plan, and further acknowledges that the Award Recipient was advised to review such materials prior to entering into this Agreement. The Award Recipient waives the right to claim that the provisions of the Plan are not binding upon the Award Recipient and the Award Recipient’s heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives and successors.

Section 6.5 Should any party hereto retain counsel for the purpose of enforcing, or preventing the breach of, any provision hereof, including, but not limited to, the institution of any action or proceeding in court to enforce any provision hereof, to enjoin a breach of any provision of this Agreement, to obtain specific performance of any provision of this Agreement, to obtain monetary or liquidated damages for failure to perform any provision of this Agreement, or for a declaration of such parties’ rights or obligations hereunder, or for any other judicial remedy, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the losing party for all costs and expenses incurred thereby, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees (including costs of appeal).

Section 6.6 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana.

Section 6.7 If any term or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall at any time or to any extent be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect as written, the Award Recipient and CenturyTel intend for any court construing this Agreement to modify or limit such provision so as to render it valid and enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. Any such provision that is not susceptible of such reformation shall be ignored so as to not affect any other term or provision hereof, and the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 6.8 The Plan and this Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and may not be modified, except as provided in the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time in the manner provided therein, or in this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time by a written document signed by each of the parties hereto. Any oral or written agreements, representations, warranties, written inducements, or other communications with respect to the subject matter contained herein made prior to the execution of the Agreement shall be void and ineffective for all purposes.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Restricted Stock Agreement to be duly executed and delivered on the day and year first above written.
