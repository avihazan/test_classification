Termination without Cause within 12 Months of Change in Control

  


If your Service is terminated by the Company without Cause within 12 months following the effective date of a “Change in Control,” the Board or the Committee may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of this award of RSUs. Further, in the event that a Change in Control that also constitutes a “change in control event” (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5)) occurs following your Orderly Retirement and prior to the full vesting of the RSUs, the Board or the Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting and payment of all of the outstanding unvested RSUs granted under this Agreement, to a time otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code, in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(j).

  


For purposes of this Agreement: “Change in Control” shall mean:

  


(i) any “person” (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including any syndicate or group deemed to be a “person” under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Barry Zyskind, George Karfunkel, Leah Karfunkel, any of their spouses or lineal descendants, any trust or charitable foundation controlled by any of them or their lineal descendants, any subsidiary or any employee benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary or former subsidiary, is or becomes a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of stock of the Company representing 50% of more of the total voting power of the Company’s then outstanding stock;

  


(ii) a tender offer (for which a filing has been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that purports to comply with the requirements of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act, and the corresponding SEC rules) is made for the stock of the Company. In case of a tender offer described in this paragraph (ii), the “Change in Control” will be deemed to have occurred any time during the offer when the person (using the definition in (i) above) making the offer owns or has accepted for payment stock of the Company with 50% or more of the total voting power of the Company's outstanding stock; or

  


(iii) individuals who were the Board’s nominees for election as directors of the Company immediately prior to a meeting of the stockholders of the Company involving a contest for the election of directors shall not constitute a majority of the Board following the election.

Share Delivery Pursuant to Vested Units; Withholding Tax

On the vesting date (or as soon as practicable thereafter but in no event after the later of (i) the last day of the calendar year in which the shares vest, or (ii) the date that is 2½ months after the applicable vesting date), at the Company’s option, (a) a brokerage account in your name will be credited with Stock representing the number of shares that vested under this grant (the “Vesting Shares”), or (b) the Company shall physically deliver the Vesting Shares. If the vesting date is not a trading day, the Stock will be delivered on the next trading day. 

  


The Company will determine the number of the Vesting Shares necessary to cover the statutory minimum amount (or such other amount determined by the Company as will not cause a negative accounting impact to the Company) of federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that the Company is required to withhold with respect to the delivery of the Vesting Shares, rounding up to the nearest whole Share of Stock (the “Withholding Shares”). By accepting this award of RSUs, you irrevocably authorize and direct the Company to withhold the Withholding Shares from the Vesting Shares at the time of delivery thereof to be used to fund the payment of the withholding taxes and instruct the Company to deliver the remaining Vesting Shares to your account.

  
  
  
If the Company or any Affiliate is required to withhold any federal, state, local or foreign taxes at any time other than upon delivery of Stock under this Agreement, then the Company or Affiliate (as applicable) shall have the right in its sole discretion to (i) require the Grantee to pay or provide for payment of the required tax withholding, or (ii) deduct the required tax withholding from any amount of salary, bonus, incentive compensation or other amounts otherwise payable in cash to the Grantee (other than deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code).

  


Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at the time of the Grantee’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), (i) the Grantee is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time), and (ii) the Company makes a good faith determination that the RSUs constitute deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to the six-month delay rule set forth in Section 409A of the Code, in order to avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company shall not deliver the Stock underlying the vested RSUs on the otherwise scheduled payment date, but such Stock shall instead be delivered on the first business day of the seventh month after such six-month period.

  
  
  
The purchase price for the vested Stock is deemed paid by your prior services to the Company.

  


Withholding shall only be applicable to employees of the Company.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, with consent to jurisdiction by you in the State of New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

  
  
  
Adjustments

Such data includes the information provided in this Agreement, other appropriate personal and financial data about you such as home address and business addresses and other contact information, payroll information and any other information deemed appropriate by the Company to facilitate the administration of the Plan.

  


By accepting this award, you consent to the Company’s processing of such personal data and the transfer of such data outside the country in which you work or are employed, including, with respect to non-U.S. residents, to the United States, to transferees who shall include the Company and other persons designated by the Company to administer the Plan.

  
  
  
Consent to Electronic Delivery

Certain statutory materials relating to the Plan may be delivered to you in electronic form. By accepting this grant, you consent to electronic delivery and acknowledge receipt of these materials, including the Plan and the Plan prospectus.
