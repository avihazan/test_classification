B. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

1\. Restriction on Transfer. Except for any Permitted Transfer, Participant shall not transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Issued Shares which are subject to the Repurchase Right. 

2\. Restrictive Legend. The stock certificate for the Issued Shares shall be endorsed with the following restrictive legend: 

“THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE UNVESTED AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REPURCHASE RIGHTS GRANTED TO THE CORPORATION AND ACCORDINGLY MAY NOT BE SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, ENCUMBERED, OR IN ANY MANNER DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TERMS OF A WRITTEN AGREEMENT DATED ____________, 200___BETWEEN THE CORPORATION AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF THE SHARES (OR THE PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST TO THE SHARES). A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS MAINTAINED AT THE CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL CORPORATE OFFICES.”

3\. Transferee Obligations. Each person (other than the Corporation) to whom the Issued Shares are transferred by means of a Permitted Transfer must, as a condition precedent to the validity of such transfer, acknowledge in writing to the Corporation that such person is bound by the provisions of this Agreement and that the transferred shares are subject to the Repurchase Right to the same extent such shares would be so subject if retained by Participant. 

C. REPURCHASE RIGHT

1\. Grant. The Corporation is hereby granted the right (the “Repurchase Right”), exercisable at any time during the ninety (90)-day period following the date Participant ceases Service for any reason other than death or Permanent Disability, to repurchase at the Repurchase Price any or all of the Issued Shares in which Participant is not, at the time of his or her cessation of Service, vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in attached Schedule I or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraph C.5 of this Agreement (such shares to be hereinafter referred to as the “Unvested Shares”). 

2\. Exercise of the Repurchase Right. The Repurchase Right shall be exercisable by written notice delivered to each Owner of the Unvested Shares prior to the expiration of the ninety (90)-day exercise period. The notice shall indicate the number of Unvested Shares to be repurchased and the date on which the repurchase is to be effected, such date to be not more than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. The certificates representing the Unvested Shares to be repurchased shall be delivered to the Corporation on the closing date specified for the repurchase.

3\. Termination of the Repurchase Right. The Repurchase Right shall terminate with respect to any Unvested Shares for which it is not timely exercised under Paragraph C.2. In addition, the Repurchase Right shall terminate and cease to be exercisable with respect to any and all Issued Shares in which Participant vests in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in attached Schedule I or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraph C.5. 

4\. Recapitalization. Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including cash paid other than as a regular cash dividend) which is by reason of any Recapitalization distributed with respect to the Issued Shares shall be immediately subject to the Repurchase Right and any escrow requirements hereunder, but only to the extent the Issued Shares are at the time covered by such right or escrow requirements. Appropriate adjustments to reflect such distribution shall be made to the number and/or class of securities subject to this Agreement and to the Repurchase Price per share to be paid upon the exercise of the Repurchase Right in order to reflect the effect of any such Recapitalization upon the Corporation’s capital structure; provided, however, that the aggregate Repurchase Price shall remain the same. 

5\. Special Vesting Acceleration. The Repurchase Right shall automatically lapse in its entirety, and the Issued Shares shall immediately vest in full, upon (i) the consummation of any Change in Control transaction or (ii) Participant’s cessation of Service by reason of death or Permanent Disability. 

D. SPECIAL TAX ELECTION

1\. Section 83(b) Election. Under Code Section 83, the excess of the fair market value of the Issued Shares on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such shares lapse over the aggregate par value paid for such shares will be reportable as ordinary income on the lapse date. For this purpose, the term “forfeiture restrictions” includes the right of the Corporation to repurchase the Issued Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Right. Participant may elect under Code Section 83(b) to be taxed at the time the Issued Shares are acquired, rather than when and as such Issued Shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions. Such election must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement. THE FORM FOR MAKING THIS ELECTION IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT II HERETO. PARTICIPANT UNDERSTANDS THAT FAILURE TO MAKE THIS FILING WITHIN THE APPLICABLE THIRTY (30)-DAY PERIOD WILL RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ORDINARY INCOME AS THE FORFEITURE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE.

2\. FILING RESPONSIBILITY. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS PARTICIPANT’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE CORPORATION’S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER CODE SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE CORPORATION OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.
