If the election of directors shall not be held on the day herein designated for the annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause such election to be held at a special meeting of the shareholders as soon thereafter as convenient.

SECTION 2.3. Place of Meetings. Each meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors shall be held at the principal office of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, unless the Board of Directors shall by resolution designate another place as the place of such meeting. Meetings of shareholders for any other purpose may be held at such place, and at such time as shall be determined by the Chairman of the Board or the President, or in their absence, by the Secretary, and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

SECTION 2.4. Notice of Meetings. Written or printed notice stating the place, date and hour of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than 10 or more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except as otherwise provided by statute. Notice of any meeting of the shareholders may be waived by any shareholder.

SECTION 2.5. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall be requisite for, and shall constitute, a quorum at all meetings of the shareholders of the Company for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or these by-laws. If a quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or 

* * *

\- 3 -

represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting if the adjournment is for thirty days or less or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

SECTION 2.6. Proxies. At every meeting of the shareholders, each shareholder having the right to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy.

SECTION 3.1. Number and Election. The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed and controlled by a board of directors, four (4) in number, none of whom needs to be a shareholder.

SECTION 3.2. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held immediately, or as soon as practicable, after the annual meeting of the shareholders in each year for the purpose of electing officers and for the transaction of such other business as may be deemed necessary, and regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such date and time and at such place as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

SECTION 3.4. Quorum. At each meeting of the Board of Directors, the presence of not less than a majority of the total number of directors specified in Section 3.1 hereof shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
