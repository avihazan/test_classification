Executive (excluding any special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments). 

b) Termination following a Change in Control: Upon a Termination following a Change in Control, Executive shall receive biweekly payments equal to 1/26 of two times the sum of (1) Executive’s highest annualized base salary during the 2 year period immediately preceding the Severance Event, less all applicable withholdings or deductions required by law and Executive’s COBRA Benefit payments, if any, plus (2) the greater of (i) all bonuses that would be payable to Executive under any incentive compensation plans in which Executive then participates at Executive’s then-current target level, or (ii) one-half of the total of any bonus or incentive compensation paid or payable to Executive for the two most recent calendar years (excluding any special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments), or if Executive has been eligible for such bonus or incentive compensation payments for less than two such periods, the last such payment paid or payable to Executive (excluding any special or one-time bonus or incentive compensation payments.

The Cash Payment shall cover the Severance Period and shall be determined as of the effective date of the applicable Severance Event. 

3\. Job Search Fees. For a period not to exceed the Severance Period, United HealthCare shall pay to an outplacement firm selected by United HealthCare an amount deemed reasonable by United HealthCare for outplacement and job search services for Executive. 

This Section 3D shall be the sole liability of United HealthCare to Executive upon the termination of this Agreement and Executive’s employment hereunder, and shall replace and be in lieu of any payments or benefits which otherwise might be owed Executive under any other severance plan or program maintained by United HealthCare. Such compensation and benefits shall be conditioned on receipt by United HealthCare of a separation agreement and a release of claims by Executive on terms and conditions acceptable to United HealthCare in its sole discretion. 

E. Definitions and Procedures. 

1\. Cause. For purposes of this Agreement “Cause” shall mean (a) the refusal of Executive to follow the reasonable direction of the Board of Directors of United HealthCare or Executive’s supervisor or to perform any duties reasonably required on material matters by United HealthCare, (b) material violations of United

##### 

HealthCare’s Code of Conduct or (c) the commission of any criminal act or act of fraud or dishonesty by Executive in connection with Executive’s employment by United HealthCare. Prior to the termination of Executive’s employment under subsection (a) of this definition of Cause, United HealthCare shall provide Executive with a 30 day notice specifying the basis for Cause. If the Cause described in the notice is cured to United HealthCare’s reasonable satisfaction prior to the end of the 30 day notice period, Executive’s employment hereunder shall not be terminated on that basis. 

2\. Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement “Change in Control” shall mean (a) the acquisition by any person, entity or “group,” within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), other than United HealthCare or any employee benefit plan of United HealthCare, of beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the common stock of UHC or the combined voting power of UHC’s then-outstanding voting securities in a transaction or series of transactions not approved in advanced by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors of UHC; (b) a change in 50% or more of the directors of UHC in any 12 month period; (c) the approval by the shareholders of UHC of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of UHC or of the sale (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of UHC other than a reorganization, merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or sale approved in advance by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors; (d) the first purchase under any tender offer or exchange offer (other than an offer by UHC) pursuant to which shares of UHC common stock are purchased; or (e) at least a majority of the directors of UHC determine in their sole discretion that there has been a change of control of UHC. 

3\. Change in Employment. For purposes of this Agreement a “Change in Employment” shall be deemed to have occurred (a) if (i) Executive’s duties are materially and adversely changed without Executive’s prior consent, (ii) Executive’s salary or benefits are reduced other than as a general reduction of salaries and benefits by United HealthCare, (iii) without terminating Executive’s employment United HealthCare terminates this Agreement, or (iv) the geographic location for the performance of Executive’s duties hereunder is moved more than 50 miles from the geographic location at the Effective Date without Executive’s prior consent, and (b) if in each case under subsections (a) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), in the period beginning 90 days before the time the Change in Employment occurs, Cause does not exist or if Cause does exist United HealthCare has not given Executive written notice that Cause exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an isolated, insubstantial or inadvertent action by United HealthCare, which is remedied by United HealthCare within 30 days after receipt of notice thereof by Executive, shall not constitute a Change in Employment. Executive may elect to treat a Change in Employment as a termination of this Agreement and Executive’s employment hereunder. To do so Executive shall send written notice of such election to United HealthCare within 90 days after the date Executive receives 

-5- 

* * *

##### 

notice from United HealthCare or otherwise is definitively informed of the events constituting the Change in Employment. No Change in Employment shall be deemed to have occurred if Executive fails to send the notice of election within the 90 day period. Executive’s failure to treat a particular Change in Employment as a termination of employment shall not preclude Executive from treating a subsequent Change in Employment as a termination of employment. The effective date of a Change in Employment termination shall be the date 30 days after United HealthCare receives the written notice of election. 

4\. Property Rights, Confidentiality, Non-Disparagement, Non-Solicit and Non-Compete Provisions. 

A. United HealthCare’s Property. 

1\. Assignment of Property Rights.
