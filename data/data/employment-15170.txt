If Ferris’ employment is terminated “for cause”, or if Ferris voluntarily resigns, then he shall not be entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock which have not yet vested pursuant to Section 5(c).  
  
  


7\. Choice of Law. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Nevada.

  


8\. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable, or void, in whole or in part, then both parties will be relieved of all obligations arising under such provision, but only to the extent it is illegal, unenforceable, or void. The parties intend that this Agreement will be deemed amended by modifying any such illegal, unenforceable, or void provision to the extent necessary to make it legal and enforceable while preserving its intent, or if such is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is legal and enforceable and achieves the same objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected by such declaration or finding and is capable of substantial performance, then each provision not so affected will be enforced to the extent permitted by law.
