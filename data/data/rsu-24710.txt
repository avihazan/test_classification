* * *

  


## Section 2.4. - Adjustments in Option Pursuant to Merger, Consolidation, etc.

## 

(a) Subject to Sections 8 and 9 of the Plan, in the event that the outstanding shares of the stock subject to the Option, are, from time to time, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of the Company or other securities of the Company by reason of a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, or other corporate event, the Committee shall make, as appropriate and equitable, an adjustment in the number and kind of shares and/or the amount of consideration as to which or for which, as the case may be, such Option, or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable and/or, other than in an event that is a Change of Control, shall pay to the Optionee a dividend in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, in any event in order to allow the Optionee to participate in such corporate event in an equitable manner. Any such adjustment made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Optionee, the Company and all other interested persons.

(b) Subject to Sections 8 and 9 of the Plan, in the event of a Change of Control in which all of the then outstanding Common Stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment per share of Common Stock (such cash payment, the “Change of Control Consideration”), the Committee may, in its discretion, either: (i) cause the Option (to the extent then outstanding and not previously exercised) to, effective as of the effective date of such a Change of Control, be converted into a right to receive a cash payment (payable as soon as practicable after the Change of Control) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Change of Control Consideration, over (B) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Option; or (ii) cause the Option (to the extent then outstanding and not previously exercised) to, effective as of the effective date of such a Change of Control, be substituted for new options to purchase shares of common stock of an acquiring or surviving entity (or any other entity that may provide for such a substitute award under Section 424 of the Code) (or, to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, be substituted for stock appreciation rights settled in cash or other equity or equity-based awards) that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of the Option, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event that the exercise price of any Option is equal to or greater than the Change of Control Consideration, such Option shall be automatically cancelled and have no further force or effect without payment of any consideration in respect thereof.

(c) In the event of a Change of Control in which Section 2.4(b) hereof does not apply, the Committee shall take any such other actions as may be in accordance with Sections 8 and 9 of the Plan and Section 2.4(a) of this Agreement in connection with the Option, or portions thereof unexercised.

(d) All actions taken by the Committee under this Section 2.4 shall be final and binding upon the Optionee, the Company and all other interested persons.

# EXERCISE OF OPTION

# 

## Section 4.1. - Person Eligible to Exercise

## 

During the lifetime of the Optionee, only he may exercise an Option or any portion thereof. After the death of the Optionee, any exercisable portion of an Option may, prior to the time when an Option becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2, be exercised by his personal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the Optionee’s will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.

## Section 4.2. - Partial Exercise

## 

Any exercisable portion of an Option or the entire Option, if then wholly exercisable, may be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the time when the Option or portion thereof becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2; provided, however, that any partial exercise shall be for whole shares of Common Stock only.

## Section 4.3. - Manner of Exercise

## 

An Option, or any exercisable portion thereof, may be exercised solely by delivering to the Secretary or his office all of the following prior to the time when the Option or such portion becomes unexercisable under Section 3.2:

### (a) Notice in writing signed by the Optionee or the other person then entitled to exercise the Option or portion thereof, stating that the Option or portion thereof is thereby exercised, such notice complying with all applicable rules established by the Committee;

### 

### (b) Full payment (in cash, by check or by a combination thereof) for the shares with respect to which such Option or portion thereof is exercised;

### 

### (c) A bona fide written representation and agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Committee, signed by the Optionee or other person then entitled to exercise such Option or portion thereof, stating that the shares of stock are being acquired for his own account, for investment and without any present intention of distributing or reselling said shares or any of them except as may be permitted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and then applicable rules and regulations thereunder, and that the Optionee or other person then entitled to exercise such Option or portion thereof will indemnify the Company against and hold it free and harmless from any loss, damage, expense or liability resulting to the Company if any sale or distribution of the shares by such person is contrary to the representation and agreement referred to above; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its reasonable discretion, take whatever additional actions it deems reasonably necessary to ensure the observance and performance of such representation and agreement and to effect compliance with the Act and any other federal or state securities laws or regulations;

### 

* * *

  


### 

### (d) Full payment to the Company of all amounts which, under federal, state or local law, it is required to withhold upon exercise of the Option; and

In addition to the foregoing, the Optionee may, in the Committee’s good faith discretion, make payment of the exercise price (as required in Section 4.3(b) above) in shares of Common Stock that the Optionee has held for at least six months or otherwise pursuant to an irrevocable broker loan program established by the Committee; and may also pay any taxes required to be withheld and paid upon any exercise (as required in Section 4.3(d) above) pursuant to an irrevocable broker loan program established by the Committee.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may require an opinion of counsel acceptable to it to the effect that any subsequent transfer of shares acquired on exercise of an Option does not violate the Act, and may issue stop-transfer orders covering such shares. Share certificates evidencing stock issued on exercise of this Option shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the provisions of subsection (c) above and the agreements herein. The written representation and agreement referred to in 

subsection (c) above shall, however, not be required if the shares to be issued pursuant to such exercise have been registered under the Act, and such registration is then effective in respect of such shares.

## Section 4.4. - Conditions to Issuance of Stock Certificates

## 

The shares of stock deliverable upon the exercise of an Option, or any portion thereof, may be either previously authorized but unissued shares or issued shares, which have then been reacquired by the Company. Such shares shall be fully paid and nonassessable. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of stock purchased upon the exercise of an Option or portion thereof prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:

### (a) The obtaining of approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency which the Committee shall, in its reasonable and good faith discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and

### 

### (b) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the exercise of the Option as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience.
