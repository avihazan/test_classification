Not less than one hundred twenty (120) days in advance of the expiration of the term of this Agreement the parties will determine whether to extend the term and, if extended, under which terms and conditions. 

1.2 During the term of this Agreement, the President and CEO shall devote his best efforts to performing such services for the Company as may be consistent with his title of President and Chief Executive Officer and those which from time to time may be assigned to him by the Company’s Board of Directors.

1.5 The President and CEO shall continue to occupy his position as a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company. Furthermore, during the term of this Agreement or extension thereof and for any elections of Directors in which his term as Director will expire, the Board of Directors shall nominate and recommend to the stockholders the election of the President and CEO to the Board of Directors of the Company.

advisory or other services for, or in connection with, or become interested in, or make financial investment in any firm, corporation, business entity or business enterprise; provided, however, that the President and CEO shall not thereby be precluded or prohibited from owning passive investments including investments in the securities of other financial institutions, so long as such ownership does not require him to devote substantial time to management or control of the business or activities in which he has invested. 

2.2 The President and CEO agrees and acknowledges that during the time that he is employed by the Company, he will maintain an intimate knowledge of the activities and affairs of the Company including trade secrets and other confidential matters.
