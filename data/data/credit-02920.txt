(B) Pursuant to a purchase agreement dated 24November 2009 between the Lender, Parent, the Guarantors, Goldman Sachs International, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

* * *

ARTICLE 1 

THE LOAN 

1.1. Each Loan shall be made in one advance and paid to the Borrower on the date of this Agreement. Each Loan shall be paid to such accounts as the Borrower shall specify to the Lender in writing.   
  
1.2. Each Loan shall be executed in the form of a bank transfer made from the Lender’s bank accounts.  
  
ARTICLE 2 

INTEREST 

2.1. For the purposes of this Article 2 only “Dollar Loan” shall mean the aggregate of the Dollar Loan divided by 0.99366 and an amount equal to the pro-rated amount of the Fees attributable to the Dollar Loan and “Euro Loan” shall mean the aggregate of the Euro Loan divided by 0.99361 and an amount equal to the Fees attributable to the Euro Loan.   
  
2.2. Interest on the Dollar Loan shall accrue from the date of this Agreement until the repayment of the Dollar Loan and shall be paid at the rate of 9.125% per annum. Interest on the Euro Loan shall accrue from the date of this Agreement until the repayment of the Euro Loan and shall be paid at the rate of 8.875% per annum.   
  
2.3. Accrued interest on each of the Dollar Loan and the Euro Loan shall be payable in arrears in immediately available funds not later than May 31 and November 30 of each year and in any event on such date as the Lender shall reasonably request such that the Lender shall be able to comply with its obligations to make corresponding payments in respect of the Notes. The first such interest payments shall be made on or before May 31, 2010.   
  
2.4. If the rate of interest on the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes increases pursuant to the terms of the Indenture: (i) the rate of interest on the Dollar Loan or the Euro Loan, as the case may be, shall increase automatically by the same percentage; and (ii) the Borrower will pay to the Lender, to cover such increase in interest rate, an amount equal to the additional rate required pursuant to the Indenture.   
  
ARTICLE 3 

REPAYMENT 

3.1. The Loans (together with all costs thereon) shall mature and be repaid in full on November 30, 2016. In the event that the entire principal amount of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes (or a portion of the principal of such Notes) is due and payable prior to their stated maturity (whether due to a redemption or offer of payment of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, a declaration of acceleration of the stated maturity date of such Notes or otherwise), the Borrower shall, promptly after demand by the Lender, repay a principal amount of the Dollar Loan or the Euro Loan, as the case may be, under this Agreement, together with the accrued interest, premiums in respect of the Notes (if any) and the amounts of any fees, costs and expenses as are due and payable under Article 4 as determined and allocated by the Lender in its absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, no prepayment of the Dollar Loan or the Euro Loan (whether in whole or in part) shall be permitted unless a corresponding prepayment of the Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as the case may be, is made concurrently therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Jelegat Loan Agreement or any similar loan agreement, the Lender shall made such demand for repayment under such agreements in its discretion, provided, however, that it shall obtain from the aggregate of such demands an amount sufficient to discharge its corresponding payment obligations in respect of the Notes.

The Borrower shall pay to the Lender on the maturity date such costs, expenses, fees (including the pro-rated amount of the Fees attributable to the Dollar Loan and the Fees attributable to the Euro Loan) and taxes (including legal and out-of-pocket expenses) determined by the Lender in its absolute discretion to be attributable to the Loans and incurred by the Lender in contemplation of, or otherwise in connection with: (i) the Notes; and (ii) the enforcement of any rights under this Agreement from the date on which such expenses were incurred to the date of payment (as well after as before judgment). The Borrower also agrees to pay on demand to the Lender an amount equal to the amounts required to be paid in satisfaction of franchise taxes and other amounts required to be paid (or advisable) to maintain corporate existence or in satisfaction of reasonable accounting, legal, management and administrative expenses.   
  
4.2. All expenses payable pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be paid together with Value Added Tax (if any) thereon.

ARTICLE 5 

PAYMENTS 

5.1. If any payment under this Agreement falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, the period (or the date for payment) shall be extended to end on the next succeeding Business Day. Where a date for payment is altered under this Section, interest shall be re-calculated accordingly.   
  
5.2. All payments by the Borrower shall be made in immediately available funds to such account as it may specify in writing, and free and clear of any present or future tax, withholding or other deduction, unconditionally and without any set-off or counter-claim whatsoever, save for any deduction which the Borrower is required to make by law.   
  
5.3. All payments by the Borrower in respect of the Dollar Loan shall be made in US Dollars only. All payments by the Borrower in respect of the Euro Loan shall be made in Euro only.   
  
5.4.
