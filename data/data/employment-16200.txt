The term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for additional terms of one (1) year each (each a “Renewal Term”) unless either party gives prior written notice of non-renewal to the other party no later than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (“Non-Renewal Notice”), or the then current Renewal Term, as the case may be. For purposes of this Agreement, the Initial Term and any Renewal Term are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Term.”

The Corporation shall review the Base Salary on an annual basis and agrees to increase it by at least 10% per annum, but has no right to decrease the Base Salary.

(b) In addition to the Base Salary set forth in Section 4(a) above, the Executive shall be entitled to receive, depending upon mutually agreeable performance targets, an annual bonus for the year in which Employer meets or exceeds performance targets during the Term at the discretion of the board of directors of the Corporation.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to be suffering from a “Total Disability” if the Executive is (i) unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death, or last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; (ii) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death, or last for continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company; or (iii) determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration. Any question as to the existence of a disability shall be determined by the written opinion of the Executive’s regularly attending physician (or his guardian) (or the Social Security Administration, where applicable).

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Good Reason” shall mean that the Executive has resigned due to (i) any material diminution in Executive’s authority, duties or responsibilities (unless the Executive has agreed to such diminution); (ii) a material change in the chain of reporting referenced in Section 2 (unless the Executive has agreed to such change); (iii) any material diminution in the Executive’s Base Salary (unless the Executive has agreed to such diminution); (iv) any material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform services to a location without the Executive’s prior written consent; (or (v) any material violation by the Corporation of its obligations under this Agreement. Prior to the Executive terminating his employment with the Corporation for Good Reason, the Executive must provide written notice to the Corporation, within 90 days following the initial existence of such condition, that such Good Reason exists and setting forth in detail the grounds the Executive believes constitutes Good Reason. If the Corporation does not cure the conditions constituting Good Reason within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice thereof from the Executive, then Executive’s employment shall be deemed terminated for Good Reason.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Cause” shall mean any material breach of this Agreement on the part of the Executive in connection with his employment duties hereunder, in all cases that is not cured within fourteen (14) days after receipt of notice thereof (to the extent such breach is capable of being cured), or the Executive’s conviction of or entering of a guilty plea or a plea of no contest with respect to a felony or any crime involving fraud, larceny or embezzlement resulting in material harm to the Corporation by the Executive.

6. Effects of Termination.

(a) Upon termination of the Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 5(a)(i) or (ii), in addition to the accrued but unpaid compensation and vacation pay through the date of death or Total Disability and any other benefits accrued to him under any Benefit Plans outstanding at such time and the reimbursement of documented, unreimbursed expenses incurred prior to such date, the Executive or his estate or beneficiaries, as applicable, shall be entitled to the following severance benefits: (i) (12) months’ Base Salary at the then current rate, to be paid in equal semi-monthly or bi-weekly installments, less withholding of all applicable taxes, at such times he would have received them if there was no termination; (ii) continued provision for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive’s death of benefits under Benefit Plans extended from time to time by the Corporation to its senior executives; and (iii) payment on a pro-rated basis of any bonus or other payments earned in connection with any bonus plan to which the Executive was a participant as of the date of death or Total Disability.

In the event the Corporation tenders a Non-Renewal Notice to the Executive, then the Executive shall be entitled to the same severance benefits as if the Executive’s employment were terminated pursuant to all items in Section 5 above except for section 5d, if such Non-Renewal Notice was triggered due to the Corporation’s statement that the Executive’s employment was terminated due to Section 5(d) (for “Cause”), then payment of severance benefits will determined by the board of directors.

(c) Upon termination of the Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 5(a)(v) or other than pursuant to Section 5(a)(i), 5(a)(ii), 5(a)(iii), 5(a)(iv), or 5(a)(vi) (i.e., without “Cause”), in addition to the accrued but unpaid compensation and vacation pay through the date of termination and any other benefits accrued to him under any Benefit Plans outstanding at such time and the reimbursement of documented, unreimbursed expenses incurred prior to such date, the Executive shall be entitled to the following severance benefits: (i) (12) months’ Base Salary at the then current rate, to be paid in equal semi-monthly or bi-weekly installments, less withholding of all applicable taxes, at such times he would have received them if there was no termination; (ii) continued provision for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of termination of the benefits under Benefit Plans extended from time to time by the Corporation to its senior executives; and (iii) payment on a pro-rated basis of any bonus or other payments earned in connection with any bonus plan to which the Executive was a participant as of the date of the Executive’s termination of employment. In addition, any options or restricted stock shall be immediately vested upon termination of Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 5(a)(v) or by the Corporation or without “Cause”.

(d) Upon termination of the Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 5(a)(iv) or (vi), in addition to the reimbursement of documented, unreimbursed expenses incurred prior to such date, the Executive shall be entitled to the following severance benefits: accrued and unpaid Base Salary and vacation pay through the date of termination, less withholding of applicable taxes.

9\. Miscellaneous.

(a) The Executive acknowledges that the services to be rendered by him under the provisions of this Agreement are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and that it would be difficult or impossible to replace such services. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that any breach or threatened breach by him of Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement shall entitle the Corporation, in addition to all other legal remedies available to it, to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to seek to enjoin such breach or threatened breach. The parties understand and intend that each restriction agreed to by the Executive hereinabove shall be construed as separable and divisible from every other restriction, that the unenforceability of any restriction shall not limit the enforceability, in whole or in part, of any other restriction, and that one or more or all of such restrictions may be enforced in whole or in part as the circumstances warrant. In the event that any restriction in this Agreement is more restrictive than permitted by law in the jurisdiction in which the Corporation seeks enforcement thereof, such restriction shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. The remedy of injunctive relief herein set forth shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or remedies that the Corporation may have at law or in equity.

(b) Neither the Executive nor the Corporation may assign or delegate any of their rights or duties under this Agreement without the express written consent of the other; provided however that the Corporation shall have the right to delegate its obligation of payment of all sums due to the Executive hereunder, provided that such delegation shall not relieve the Corporation of any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) This Agreement constitutes and embodies the full and complete understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the Executive’s employment by the Corporation, supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between the Executive and the Corporation, and shall not be amended, modified or changed except by an instrument in writing executed by the party to be charged. The invalidity or partial invalidity of one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not invalidate any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver by either party of any provision or condition to be performed shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same time or any prior or subsequent time.

(d) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be binding upon and enforceable against, the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, beneficiaries and permitted assigns.

* * *

(e) The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(f) All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered, sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by private overnight mail service (e.g. Federal Express) to the party at the address set forth above or to such other address as either party may hereafter give notice of in accordance with the provisions hereof. Notices shall be deemed given on the sooner of the date actually received or the third business day after sending.

(g) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without reference to principles of conflicts of laws and each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in the State of New York.

(h) This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one of the same instrument. The parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.

10\. Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), the Executive shall receive all monies and compensation due for the term of this contract. This contract will be enforceable but the duties and responsibilities may change for the executive subject to mutual agreement between the Executive and the new ownership or the executive may exercise his termination clause and be entitled to all compensation as stated above. The Executive (or his estate) shall receive all payments provided herein at such times as he would have received them if there was no Change of Control.

For purposes of this Agreement “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) Any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 50% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation’s then outstanding voting securities or 50% or more of the fair market value of the Corporation;

Or

(c) The Corporation has sold all or substantially all of its assets to another person or entity that is not a majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the above-listed events must satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) in order to be deemed a Change of Control.

11\. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(a) In the event the Executive or the Corporation is the subject of an investigation (whether criminal, civil, or administrative) involving possible violations of the United States federal securities laws by the Executive, the Compensation Committee or the Board may, in its sole discretion, direct the Corporation to withhold any and all payments to the Executive (whether compensation or otherwise) which would have otherwise been made pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise would have been paid or payable by the Corporation, which the Compensation Committee or the Board believes, in its sole discretion, may or could be considered an “extraordinary payment” and therefore at risk and potentially subject to, the provisions of Section 1103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) (including, but not limited to, any severance payments made to the Executive upon termination of employment). The withholding of any payment shall be until such time as the investigation is concluded, without charges having been brought or until the successful conclusion of any legal proceedings brought in connection with such amounts as directed by the Compensation Committee or the Board to be withheld with or without the accruing of interest (and if with interest the rate thereof). Except by an admission of wrongdoing or the final adjudication by a court or administrative agency finding the Executive liable for or guilty of violating any of the federal securities laws, rules or regulations, the Compensation Committee or the Board shall pay to the Executive such compensation or other payments. Notwithstanding the exclusion caused by the first clause of the prior sentence, the Executive shall receive such payments if provided for by a court or other administrative order.

(b) In the event that the Corporation restates any financial statements which have been contained in reports or registration statements filed with the SEC, and the restatement of the prior financial statements is as the result of material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Executive hereby acknowledges that the Corporation shall recover from the Executive (i) incentive based compensation (including stock options) awarded during the three year period preceding the date on which the Corporation is required to prepare the restatement (ii) in excess of what would have been paid the Executive under the restatement. Any rules passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (added by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) shall be incorporated in this Agreement to the extent applicable. The Executive agrees to reimburse the Corporation for any bonuses received and/or profits realized from the sale of the Corporation’s securities (including the cash received from exercise of any options (or other awards of stock rights) during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC of the report or registration statement (whichever comes first) containing the financial information required to be restated. Provided, however, this Section shall not impose any liability on the Executive beyond any liability that is imposed under Section 304 of SOX.

(c) Notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 10(b), if the Corporation’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and such exchange adopts rules requiring clawbacks beyond what Section 304 of SOX requires, such rules shall be incorporated in this Agreement to the extent applicable and the Executive shall comply with such rules, including but not limited to executing any amendment to this Agreement.

* * *

12\. Section 409A.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at the time of the Executive’s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Corporation determines that the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive’s separation from service would be considered deferred compensation subject to the 20% additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the Executive’s separation from service, or (ii) the Executive’s death (the “Six Month Delay Rule”).

(b) For purposes of this Section 12, amounts payable under the Agreement should not be considered a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (i.e., short-term deferrals), Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (i.e., separation pay plans, including the exception under subparagraph (iii)), and other applicable provisions of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.409A-1 through A-6.

(c) To the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to payments otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of the Six Month Delay Rule, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule.

(d) To the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to the provision of benefits (including, but not limited to, life insurance and medical insurance), such benefit coverage shall nonetheless be provided to the Executive during the first six months following his separation from service (the “Six Month Period”), provided that, during such Six-Month Period, the Executive pays to the Corporation, on a monthly basis in advance, an amount equal to the Monthly Cost (as defined below) of such benefit coverage. The Corporation shall reimburse the Executive for any such payments made by the Executive in a lump sum not later than 30 days following the sixth month anniversary of the Executive’s separation from service. For purposes of this subparagraph, “Monthly Cost” means the minimum dollar amount which, if paid by the Executive on a monthly basis in advance, results in the Executive not being required to recognize any federal income tax on receipt of the benefit coverage during the Six Month Period.

(e) The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.

8

* * *

(f) The Corporation makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the hiring by the Company of the Employee as an employee of the Company, the Employee hereby agrees as follows:

2\. Non-disclosure of Confidential Information. The Employee agrees that, during the term of his or her employment with the Company and thereafter, he or she will not disclose the Confidential Information or use it in any way, except on behalf of the Company, whether or not such Confidential Information is produced by the Employee’s own efforts. The Employee further agrees, upon termination of his or her employment, promptly to deliver to the Company all Confidential Information, whether or not such Confidential Information was produced by the Employee’s own efforts, and to refrain from making, retaining or distributing copies thereof.

3\. Inventions and Discoveries.

5\. Power of Attorney.

10\. Waivers. The waiver by the Company or the Employee of any action, right or condition in this Agreement, or of any breach of a provision of this Agreement, shall not constitute a waiver of any other occurrences of the same event.

11\. Survival; Binding Effect. This Agreement shall survive the termination of the Employment Agreement regardless of the manner of such termination, and shall be binding upon the Employee and his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
