PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

  


You have been selected by the Compensation Committee of the Brown Shoe Company, Inc. Board of Directors (the “Committee”) to be a Participant in the Performance Unit Award Plan under the Incentive and Stock Compensation Plan of 2002, as Amended and Restated (the “Plan”) of Brown Shoe Company, Inc. (the “Company”), as specified below:

Participant: ________

Performance Award:

Target Number of Performance Shares: ___ shares of Company Common Stock, $.01 par value

  


Target Cash-Based Award: $___

Performance Period: [beginning of current fiscal year] to [end of third fiscal year]

  


Performance Measure: Cumulative earnings per share for three fiscal years and compound annual revenue growth for three fiscal years.

THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, effective ___, 20__, represents the grant of both Performance Shares (“Performance Shares”) and the Cash-Based Award (“Cash”) (collectively, the “Award”) by the Company to the Participant named above, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.

  


The Plan provides a complete description of the terms and conditions governing the Award. If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Award Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the Plan’s terms shall completely supersede and replace the conflicting terms of this Agreement. All capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan, unless specifically set forth otherwise herein. The parties hereto agree as follows:

  


1.

Performance Period. The Performance Period commences on ____, 20__ and ends on ____, 20__.  
  
2. Value of Award. The Award shall represent and have a maximum value equal to two times the value of each component (that is, a maximum of two times the target number of Performance Shares and two times the target amount of Cash).  
3.

Award Payoff and Achievement of Performance Measures. The Award to be earned under this Agreement shall be based upon the Company’s cumulative earnings per share for Fiscal Years 20__, 20__ and 20__ and compound annual revenue growth for Fiscal Years 20__, 20__ and 20__. For this purpose, earnings per share shall be calculated based on annual net earnings per diluted share (in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles), and is subject to the Committee’s right, pursuant to Section 14.2 of the Plan, to make adjustments for unusual or nonrecurring events. Unless otherwise specifically provided by the Committee, if the Participant was not an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries upon commencement of the Performance Period, then the value of the earned Award and the amount payable to the Participant shall be pro-rated and payable based on the number of days of Participant’s employment during the Performance Period as a percent of the total number of days during the Performance Period.  
  
Revenue shall represent the “net sales” reported in our financial statements, and the compound annual revenue growth rate percentage shall be calculated based on the geometric average growth rate in revenue for Fiscal Years 20__, 20__ and 20__.

The percent of the Award earned shall then be determined based on the following chart:

Termination Provisions. Except as provided below, a Participant shall be eligible for payment of the earned Award, as specified in Section 3, only if the Participant’s employment with the Company continues through the end of the Performance Period. If a Participant retires at normal retirement date or at early retirement date with the approval of the Committee (“Retirement”), or suffers a permanent Disability, or dies during the Performance Period, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that the Participant shall be eligible for that proportion of the Award earned under Section 3 for such Performance Period that his or her number of full months of participation during the Performance Period, bears to the total number of months in the Performance Period. In the event of the death of the Participant, his or her beneficiary shall be entitled to the Award to which the Participant otherwise would have been entitled under the same conditions as would have been applicable to the Participant. Awards will be payable under this Section 4 (including upon Retirement, death or Disability) at the time specified in Section 6, but only to the extent that the performance goals set forth in Section 3 have been met.  
  
  


5.

7.

Change in Control. If a Participant is employed by the Company on the date of a Change in Control, subject to Article 2.7 and Article 13 of the Plan, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchange, the Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire Performance Period as of the occurrence of the Change in Control, at the target level, and shall be paid out within thirty (30) days following the effective date of the Change in Control.  
  
  


8.

Recapitalization. Subject to Article 4.2 of the Plan, in the event that there is any change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as any merger, consolidation, separation including a spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Company, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Code 368) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such adjustment shall be made in the number and class and/or price of the Company’s Common Stock subject to this Award, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights; provided, however, that the number of Performance Shares subject to this Award shall always be a whole number.

All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing on such form as may be required by the Company, signed by the Participant, and subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
