EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of June 10, 2002, by and between GENTIVA HEALTH SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and RONALD A. MALONE ("Executive").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Company desires that Executive serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Executive is willing to serve as such;

WHEREAS, the Company and Executive wish to enter into an agreement embodying the terms of his employment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the "Agreement"); and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:

1\. Employment. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to his employment by the Company until the third anniversary of the Effective Date (as defined below) of this Agreement. The period during which Executive is employed pursuant to this Agreement shall be referred to as the "Employment Period."

2\. Position and Duties. During the Employment Period, Executive shall serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall be nominated for election, and if so elected, shall serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). In addition, Executive shall serve in such other position or positions with the Company and its subsidiaries commensurate with his position and experience as the Board shall from time to time specify. During the Employment Period, Executive shall have the duties, responsibilities and obligations customarily assigned to individuals serving as the chairman and chief executive officer of comparable companies, and such other duties, responsibilities and obligations as the Board shall from time to time specify. Executive shall devote his full time to the services required of him hereunder, except for vacation time and reasonable periods of absence due to sickness, personal injury or other disability, and shall use his best efforts, judgment, skill and energy to perform such services in a manner consonant with the duties of his position and to improve and advance the business and interests of the Company and its subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall preclude Executive from (i) serving on the board of directors of any business corporation, unless such service would be contrary to applicable law, (ii) serving on the board of, or working for, any charitable or community organization or (iii) pursuing his personal financial and legal affairs, so long as such activities, individually or collectively, do not interfere with the performance of Executive's duties hereunder or violate any of the provisions of Section 6 hereof.

3\. Compensation.

(a) Base Salary. During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay Executive a base salary at the annual rate of $400,000 per annum. The annual base salary payable under this section shall be reduced, however, to the extent Executive elects to defer such salary under the terms of any deferred compensation or savings plan or arrangement maintained or established by the Company or any other arrangement acceptable to the Company. The Board (or the appropriate committee of the Board) shall annually review Executive's base salary in light of competitive practices, the base salaries paid to other executive officers of the Company and the performance of Executive and the Company, and may, in its discretion, increase such base salary by an amount it determines to be appropriate. Any such increase shall not reduce or limit any other obligation of the Company hereunder. Executive's base salary (as set forth or as may be increased from time to time) shall not be reduced, except that Executive's base salary may be reduced in proportion to comparable reductions in the base salaries of the Company's other executive officers (as determined for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Executive's annual base salary payable hereunder, as it may be increased from time to time and without reduction for any amounts deferred as described above, is referred to herein as "Base Salary." The Company shall pay Executive the portion of his Base Salary not deferred not less frequently than in equal bi-weekly installments.

(b) Annual Bonus. For each calendar year ending during the Employment Period, Executive shall have the opportunity to receive an annual bonus ("Annual Target Bonus Opportunity"), based on the achievement of target levels of performance, equal to 80% of his Base Salary, provided that, so long as Executive is employed on the last day of the calendar year, in no event shall the annual bonus payable to Executive for the Company's 2002 fiscal year be less than an amount equal to 50% of Executive's Target Bonus (as established by the Company's Compensation Committee), regardless of whether any applicable performance criteria have been met. Depending on actual results as measured against the performance objectives established, Executive's actual bonus payment may range from (i) a low of (A) 50% of Executive's Target Bonus with respect to the Company's 2002 fiscal year prorated from the date of this Agreement to the end of the year, and (B) zero for subsequent fiscal years to (ii) a maximum of 140% of Executive's Base Salary for each full fiscal year during the Employment Period. Subject to the guaranteed minimum set forth above, the actual bonus, if any, payable for any such year shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the Company's Executive Officers' Bonus Plan (the "Annual Plan") based upon the performance of the Company and/or Executive against target objectives established under such Annual Plan. The determination of whether and to what extent the requisite performance objectives have been met shall be made by the Board committee responsible for administering the Annual Plan, whose determination shall be final. Subject to Executive's election to defer all or a portion of any annual bonus payable hereunder pursuant to the terms of any deferred compensation or savings plan or arrangement maintained or established by the Company, any annual bonus payable under this Section 3(b) shall be paid to Executive in accordance with the terms of the Annual Plan, provided, however, that, regardless of the terms of such Annual Plan, Executive shall have the right to defer payment of up to that portion of his annual bonus which, when coupled with any portion of his Base Salary deferred for the same year of service, does not

* * *

-3-

exceed 50% (or such greater percentage as the Company shall permit) of the sum of his Base Salary and his annual bonus, provided, however, that, any portion of Executive's annual bonus which would not be deductible to the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall be deferred. Unless Executive shall otherwise elect a different payment date or dates or a different number of payments, any portion of Executive's annual bonus and/or Base Salary which is deferred in accordance with this Section 3 (whether at Executive's election or by reason of Section 162(m)) shall be payable to Executive in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following termination of Executive's employment for any reason and shall be credited with interest, on a compounded basis, on the last day of each calendar quarter, at 1% above the prime rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition), as in effect on the first day of each such calendar quarter. Any election by Executive to change the timing of the distribution of the deferred amounts and/or the number of payments to be made shall be made in writing in a calendar year prior to the date payment is to be made, and shall only be effective if Executive completes at least six months' additional service as an employee following the date any such election is filed with the Secretary of the Company.

4\. Benefits, Perquisites and Expenses.

(a) Benefits. During the Employment Period, Executive shall be eligible to participate in (i) each welfare benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company, including, without limitation, each group life, hospitalization, medical, dental, health, accident or disability insurance or similar plan or program of the Company, and (ii) each pension, retirement, deferred compensation, savings or employee stock purchase plan sponsored or maintained by the Company, and (iii) to the extent of any awards made from time to time by the Board committee administering the plan, each stock option, restricted stock, stock bonus or similar equity-based compensation plan sponsored or maintained by the Company, in each case, whether now existing or established hereafter, to the extent that Executive is eligible to participate in any such plan under the generally applicable provisions thereof. Nothing in this Section 4(a) shall limit the Company's right to amend or terminate any such plan in accordance with the procedures set forth therein.

(b) Perquisites. During the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to at least four weeks' paid vacation annually and shall also be entitled to receive such perquisites as are generally provided to other senior officers of the Company in accordance with the then current policies and practices of the Company 

(c) Business Expenses. During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay or reimburse Executive for all reasonable expenses incurred or paid by Executive in the performance of Executive's duties hereunder, upon presentation of expense statements or vouchers and such other information as the Company may require and in accordance with the generally applicable policies and procedures of the Company.

(d) Indemnification. During the Employment Period, the Company shall indemnify Executive and hold Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or cause of action arising from or out of Executive's performance as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any other capacity, including any fiduciary capacity, in which Executive serves at the request of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of Sections 5 and 6, capitalized terms have the following meanings:

"Additional Benefits" means, if Executive's employment terminates due to death or in a Termination due to Disability, the benefits described in subclause (i) below, or if the Executive's employment is terminated in a Termination Without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason, the benefits described in subclauses (i) and (ii):

(i) All of the Executive's benefits accrued under the pension, retirement, savings and deferred compensation plans of the Company shall become vested in full; provided, however, that to the extent such accelerated vesting of benefits cannot be provided under one or more of such plans consistent with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such benefits shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 10 days after termination of employment outside the applicable plan; and

(ii) Executive (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents) will be entitled to continue participation in all of the Company's medical, dental and vision care plans (the "Health Benefit Plans"), until the 24 month anniversary of Executive's termination of employment; provided that Executive's participation in the Company's Health Benefit Plans shall cease on any earlier date that Executive becomes eligible for comparable benefits from a subsequent employer. Executive's participation in the Health Benefit Plans will be on the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any contributions that would have been required from Executive) that would have applied had Executive continued to be employed by the Company. To the extent any such benefits cannot be provided under the terms of the applicable plan, policy or program, the Company shall provide a comparable benefit under another plan or from the Company's general assets.

"Disability" means long-term disability within the meaning of the Company's long-term disability plan or program.

"Earned Salary" means any Base Salary earned, but unpaid, for services rendered to the Company on or prior to the date on which the Employment Period ends pursuant to Section 5(a) (other than Base Salary deferred pursuant to Executive's election, as provided in Section 3(a) of (b) hereof).

"Severance Benefit" means an amount equal to two (2) times the Executive's Base Salary; provided, however, that Severance Benefits shall not be payable under this Agreement to the Executive if the termination of the Executive's employment results in the payment of severance benefits under the Executive's Change in Control Agreement with the Company dated June 14, 2002.

"Termination for Cause" means a termination of Executive's employment by the Company due to (i) Executive's conviction of a felony, (ii) Executive's willful and continued failure to perform the material duties of his position which has had (or is expected to have) a material adverse effect on the business of the Company or its subsidiaries, or (iii) Executive's breach of any material Company policy or procedure which has had (or is expected to have) a material adverse effect on the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.

Such amounts shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any and all such rights and claims and, upon Executive's receipt of such amounts, the Company shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to Executive in connection with this Agreement or otherwise in connection with Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries. If requested by the Company, Executive shall execute a release following termination of his employment, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company (but not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement), as a prior condition to the receipt of the benefits payable pursuant to this Section 5. Nothing in this Section 5(e) shall be construed to release the Company from its commitment to indemnify Executive and hold Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or cause of action as described in Section 4(e).

(f) Excise Tax Cut Back.

If, as a result of subsequent events or conditions, it is determined that payments have been reduced by more than the minimum amount required under this Section 5(f), then an additional payment shall be promptly made to the Executive in an amount equal to the excess reduction.

(ii) All determinations required to be made under this Section 5(f), including whether a payment would result in an Excise Tax shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or other nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive as requested by the Company or the Executive.

Such non-public information shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(i) information which the Company Group has compiled to identify, develop and service its clients and customers, including "negative research" to identify those entities who have not subscribed to the services of the Company and its subsidiaries;

(c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the Employment Period and the one-year period following any termination of Executive's employment, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, for his own benefit or that of any other person, offer any employment in a similar field or business association to any of the Company's employees, agents or representatives or suggest or in any way encourage, any of the Company's employees, agents or representatives to terminate their employment or business association with the Company.

(e) Company Property. Except as expressly provided herein, promptly following Executive's termination of employment, Executive shall return to the Company all property of the Company.
