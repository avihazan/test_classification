Exhibit 99.4



This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the “Agreement”), is entered into as of the Grant Date, by and between Hexcel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the Grantee.

The Company maintains the Hexcel Corporation 2003 Incentive Stock Plan (the “Plan”. The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has determined that the Grantee shall be granted Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter contained. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. The shares underlying this RSU award are not from the Plan, but rather are treasury shares or shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock

1. Notice of Grant; Incorporation of Plan. A Notice of Grant is attached hereto as Annex A and incorporated by reference herein. Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and set forth in the Notice of Grant shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Notice of Grant and capitalized terms used in this Agreement and set forth in the Plan shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, as the Plan may be amended from time to time, provided that any such amendment of the Plan must be made in accordance with Section IX of the Plan. This RSU award shall be construed as though it were an award under the Plan except insofar as the source of the shares shall be as stated above.

2. Terms of Restricted Stock Units. The grant of RSUs provided in Section 1 hereof shall be subject to the following terms, conditions and restrictions:

(a) The Grantee shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in shares of the Common Stock in respect of the RSUs until such RSUs have vested and been distributed to the Grantee in the form of shares of Common Stock.

(b) Except as provided in this Section 2(b), the RSUs and any interest therein may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, prior to the distribution of the Common Stock in respect of such RSUs and subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement. Any attempt to transfer RSUs in contravention of this Section is void ab initio. RSUs shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall be permitted to transfer RSUs to members of his or her immediate family (i.e., children, grandchildren or spouse), trusts for the benefit of such family members, and partnerships or other entities whose only partners or equity owners are such family members; provided, however, that no consideration can be paid for the transfer of the RSUs and the transferee of the RSUs musts agree to be subject to all conditions applicable to the RSUs (including all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement) prior to transfer.

* * *

  


(c) Forfeiture of RSUs on Certain Conditions.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, should the Grantee while an employee or after termination of employment fail to comply with the “Protective Condition” (as defined in Section 2(c)(ii)), then the RSUs, to the extent not already converted into shares of Common Stock distributed to the Grantee, shall immediately expire upon the Grantee’s failure to meet such condition.

(ii) “Protective Condition” shall mean that the Grantee (A) complies with all terms and provisions of any obligation of confidentiality to the Company contained in a written agreement signed by the Grantee, and (B) does not engage, in any capacity, directly or indirectly, including but not limited to as employee, agent, consultant, manager, executive, owner or stockholder (except as a passive investor holding less than a 5% equity interest in any enterprise) in any business entity engaged in competition with the business conducted by the Company on the date of the Grantee’s termination of employment with the Company anywhere in the world (except that the Grantee may be employed by a competitor of the Company so long as the Grantee’s duties and responsibilities do not relate directly or indirectly to the business segment of the new employer which is competitive with the business conducted by the Company).

3. Vesting and Conversion of RSUs. Subject to Section 4, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock that will be immediately distributed to the Grantee at the rate of 33-1/3% of the RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of January 26, 2009.

4. Termination of Employment; Change of Control.

(a) For purposes of the grant hereunder, any transfer of employment by the Grantee among the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be considered a termination of employment. Any change in employment that does not constitute a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations (or any successor provision) shall not be considered a termination of employment. Any change in employment that does constitute a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations (or any successor provision) shall be considered a termination of employment.

(b) If the Grantee dies or terminates employment due to Disability (as defined in the last Section hereof), all RSUs shall immediately vest, be converted into shares of Common Stock and be distributed to the Grantee within 30 days of the date of such termination; provided, however, that if the Grantee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) as of the date of such termination, all RSUs shall immediately vest but shall not be converted into shares of Common Stock and distributed to the Grantee until the earlier of (i) the date which is six months after the date of the Grantee’s termination of employment and (ii) the date of the Grantee’s death. If the Grantee’s employment with the Company terminates due to the Grantee’s Retirement (as defined in the last Section hereof), all RSUs shall continue to vest (and be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock that will be distributed to the Grantee) in accordance with Section 3 above. If the Grantee dies during the three year period immediately following the Retirement of the Grantee, then all RSUs shall immediately vest, be converted into

* * *

  


shares of Common Stock and be distributed to the Grantee’s personal representative within 30 days of the date of such death.

(c) Subject to Section 4(d), if the Grantee’s employment terminates for any reason other than death, Disability or Retirement, the Grantee shall forfeit all unvested RSUs.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein or in the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the last Section hereof) or of the termination of this Agreement within twelve months of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company that is taxed under Section 331 of the Code, all RSUs shall immediately vest, be converted into shares of Common Stock and be distributed to the Grantee within 30 days of the date of such event or (in the event of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company) as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.

5. Equitable Adjustment. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to the RSUs shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital adjustment, or the payment of a stock dividend or other increase or decrease in such shares, effected without the receipt of consideration by the Company, or other change in corporate or capital structure. The Committee shall also make the foregoing changes and any other changes, including changes in the classes of securities available, to the extent reasonably necessary or desirable to preserve the intended benefits under this Agreement in the event of any other reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or other distribution or similar transaction involving the Company.

6. Issuance of Shares. Any shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Grantee under this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement may be issued in either certificated form, or in uncertificated form (via the Direct Registration System or otherwise).

7. Taxes. The Grantee shall pay to the Company or a Subsidiary promptly upon request any taxes the Company reasonably determines it or a Subsidiary is required to withhold under applicable tax laws with respect to the vesting and/or conversion of the RSUs. Such payment shall be made as provided in Section VIII(f) of the Plan.

8 No Guarantee of Employment. Nothing set forth herein or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee any right of continued employment for any period by the Company, or shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate such employment.

9 Section 409A

(a) It is intended that this Agreement comply in all respects with the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2) through (4) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations and other generally applicable guidance issued thereunder (collectively, the “Applicable Regulations”), and this Agreement shall be interpreted for all purposes in accordance with this intent.

The Company shall notify the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable of any such amendment affecting the Grantee.

(c) In the event that the amounts payable under this Agreement are subject to any taxes, penalties or interest under the Applicable Regulations, the Grantee shall be solely liable for the payment of any such taxes, penalties or interest.

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the time for distribution of the RSUs as provided in Sections 3, 4(b) and 4(c) shall not be accelerated or delayed for any reason, unless to the extent necessary to comply with or permitted under the Applicable Regulations.
