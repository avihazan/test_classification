5\. AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

Employee and the Company understand and expressly agree that Employee’s employment with the Company is at-will, is not for a specified term, and may be terminated by the Company or by Employee at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause. While not required, as a courtesy, the parties shall attempt if possible to give thirty (30)

* * *

  


days’ notice of termination. This clause shall not be interpreted to conflict with Employee’s at-will employment status. Employee and the Company further understand and agree that no representation contrary to this section is valid, and that this section may not be augmented, contradicted, or modified in any way, by any representative or agent of the Company or any other person, except by a writing signed by the Employee and by the Board.

6\. TERMINATION

6.1 Upon termination for any reason, including voluntary resignation, Employee shall:

(a) Be entitled to the compensation set forth in Section 3(a) hereof, prorated to the effective date of such termination;

(i) Pay Employee seven months’ base compensation if the termination occurs before there has been a Corporate Transaction (to be defined later in this section) or pay Employee twelve months’ base compensation if the termination occurs after there has been a Corporate Transaction. Such payments are to be made in accordance with Company’s normal payroll procedures with normal payroll deductions.

(ii) Continue to provide to Employee all heath-care benefits, and other benefits that might apply, for the remainder of the month in which the termination occurs and reimburse Employee for Employee’s COBRA coverage for another seven-month period beyond that, or for a twelve-month period if the termination occurs after there has been a Corporate Transaction.

(iv) The term “Cause” is defined to mean conduct that in the good faith judgment of the Board constitutes a material breach of duty and is to include one or more of the following: falsification of company documents, fraud, moral turpitude, theft, embezzlement, criminal conduct, indictment on felony criminal charges, serious violations of Company policies, material breach of Employee’s employment agreement, extended or repeated absence from work that in the reasonable judgment of the Board is unjustifiable, inability to perform duties for a period of thirty (30) or more days without reasonable excuse and notice, or insubordination (e.g., refusal to carry out the reasonable instructions of the Board). If the material breach of duty is reasonably curable, Company shall provide notice to Employee of such breach of duty and shall give Employee a 30-day cure period. Refusal to relocate to a facility more than 50 miles from the current facility is NOT considered Cause.

(v) The term “Corporate Transaction” is defined to mean (a) a transaction whereby the Company is party to a merger or consolidation whereby the Company is NOT the surviving entity and whereby the transaction results in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto failing to continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or another entity) at least fifty (50%) percent of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving or other entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (or consummation of any transaction having similar effect).

(vi) Employee will be eligible for no other severance compensation, benefits, or vesting other than that which is provided for in this Section 6.2 when he is terminated. A condition precedent to the Company’s obligation to fulfill the severance terms in this Section 6.2 shall be Employee’s execution of a full and complete release of all claims against the Company, its Board, officers, agents, and affiliates in reasonable form as provided by the Company. Nothing in this severance provision supersedes or in any way alters the at-will provisions of Section 5 above.

(vii) Employee agrees that he will surrender to the Company, at its request, or at the conclusion of his employment, all accounts, notes, data, sketches, drawings and reproductions, and copies thereof, any of which (a) relate in any way to the business, products, practices, or techniques of the Company, (b) contain Confidential Information, whether or not created by him, or (c) come into his possession by reason of his employment with the Company; and Employee agrees further that all of the foregoing are the property of the Company.

7\. LOYAL PERFORMANCE

7.1 Employee shall not, during the period of his employment by the Company, engage in any employment or activity in any business competitive with the Company. Employee agrees to notify the Company in writing of any outside employment or business activity,

* * *

  


including the name of the business and the general nature of employee’s involvement, during the period of Employee’s employment with the Company.

7.2 If, at any time during the period ending two years after Employee has ceased to be an employee of the Company (or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company), whether or not pursuant to this agreement, Employee:

(a) directly or indirectly engages with...

(b) assists or has an active interest in, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, joint venturer, corporate officer, director, employee, consultant, principal, agent, trustee or licensor, or in any other similar capacity whatsoever (provided that ownership of not more than two percent of the outstanding stock of a corporation traded on a National securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ OTC shall not of itself be viewed as assisting or having an active interest)...

or

(c) enters the employment of or acts as an agent for or advisor or consultant to...

... any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, business organization, entity, or enterprise (the Business”) that is, or is about to become, directly or indirectly, engaged in any business or program that competes directly with or is substantially similar to any business or program that the Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company) was involved in (or was in the planning or development stage) during the 120-day period immediately prior to Employee’s ceasing to provide services to the Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company) [such business or program shall include, but not be limited to, those that involve: (a) any composition of matter or method that is protected by (i) any Company trade secret or (ii) any Company intellectual property that is either issued, pending, or filed at the time of termination or (b) the use, research or development, for any therapeutic or diagnostic purpose, of (i) any sphingolipid, (ii) lysophosphatidic acid, Ceramide-1-phosphate, PAF, or HETE or (iii) any component of their respective pathways], then Employee shall immediately notify Company in writing of such involvement, including the name of the Business and the nature of Employee’s involvement, and Employee agrees to fully respond to reasonable questions by the Company regarding such involvement and to provide such further assurances reasonably requested by Company that Employee is not and will not be in breach of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.

7.3 Employee will not, at any time, without prior written consent of the Company:

(a) Directly or indirectly take any action or make or cause to be made any statements which would disparage the reputation of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, or

5

* * *

  


any of its or their subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment.

7.4 Nothing contained in this Section 7 is intended to supercede or alter in any way the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8\. CONFIDENTIALITY MATTERS

8.1 It is an express condition to the employment of Employee by Company that Employee sign and deliver a Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A concurrently with the execution of this Agreement.

## 8.2 . The covenants contained in the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement constitute separate covenants. If in any judicial proceeding, a court shall hold that any of the covenants set forth in the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement is not permitted by applicable laws, Employee and Company agree that such provision shall and is hereby reformed to the maximum time, geographic, or occupational limitations permitted by such laws. Further, in the event a court shall hold unenforceable any of the separate covenants deemed included herein, then such unenforceable covenant or covenants shall be deemed eliminated from the provisions of this Agreement for the purpose of such proceeding to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in such proceeding. Employee and Company further agree that the covenants in the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement shall each be construed as a separate agreement independent of any other provisions of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Employee against the Company whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any of the covenants set forth in the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.

## 

9\. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Employee acknowledges that he has been advised by Company to consult with independent counsel of his own choice, at his expense, as to the entering into this Agreement, that he has had the opportunity to do so, and that he has taken advantage of the opportunity to the extent that he desires. The Employee further acknowledges that he has read and that he understands this Agreement, is fully aware of its legal effect, and has entered into it freely based on his own judgment and such professional advice as he has seen fit to obtain.

10\. ARBITRATION

Employee and the Company agree that in the event of any dispute concerning, arising out of, or related in any way to this Agreement, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the disputes subject to this agreement to arbitrate include, to the fullest extent allowable by law, all potential claims between

6

* * *

  


Employee and Company including, but not limited to, breach of contract, tort, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, compensation and benefits claims, constitutional claims and claims for the violation of any local, state or federal statute, ordinance or regulation. Arbitration proceedings may be commenced by either party by giving the other party written notice thereof and proceeding thereafter in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and California law. Any such arbitration shall take place before a single arbitrator only in San Diego, California. Any such arbitration shall be governed by and be subject to the applicable laws of the State of California and the then-prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). If the parties are unable to agree on a single neutral arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules. The arbitrator’s award in any such arbitration shall be final and binding, and a judgment upon such award may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement understands that by agreeing to arbitrate their disputes, they are giving up their right to have their disputes heard in a court of law and, if applicable, by a jury. Company shall bear the costs of the arbitrator, the forum, and filing fees. Each party shall bear its own respective attorney’s fees and all other costs, unless otherwise required or allowed by law and awarded by the arbitrator.

11\. VIOLATION OF THE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND INVENTIONS AGREEMENT

The Employee agrees and acknowledges that the violation of any of the provisions contained in the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A would cause irreparable injury to the Company, the remedy at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be inadequate, and that the Company shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving actual damages. The Employee agrees that such relief shall be available in a court of law in San Diego, California, regardless of the arbitration provisions contained in Section 10 of this Agreement.
