Such notice shall specify the number of Optioned Shares in respect of which the option hereby granted is being exercised and either shall be accompanied by payment to the Company in the City of Seattle of the full purchase price for the number of Optioned Shares so specified, or shall specify that payment of the full purchase price for the number of Optioned Shares so specified shall be made to the transfer agent and registrar of the Shares in exchange for a certificate or certificates representing the number of the Optioned Shares so specified. Such notice, if mailed, shall be deemed to have been given on the day upon which such notice is actually received by the Company and, if delivered as aforesaid, shall be deemed to have been given on the date of delivery.   
  
Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall forthwith instruct the transfer agent and registrar of the Shares to deliver to the Optionee or his legal personal representative, as the case may be (or as otherwise directed in the notice exercising the option) within twenty (20) days thereafter a certificate or certificates in the name of the Optionee or his legal personal representative as the case may be for the number of Optioned Shares in respect of which the option is being exercised.

12.
