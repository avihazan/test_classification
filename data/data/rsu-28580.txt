THE SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT UNDER THE COMPANY’S 2012 STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND THE COMPANY. A COPY OF THE PLAN AND THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY.  
  
Vesting:

Annual Determination. As soon as practicable following the end of each fiscal year of the Company during the Performance Period, the Committee will determine and certify the level of achievement of the Performance Goals (as defined below) with respect to the immediately preceding fiscal year. If the Committee determines that the Target Amount (as defined below) of both of the Performance Goals was achieved as of the end of such fiscal year, then 100% of the Shares will vest as of the date of such determination, and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date.

Final Determination. If the Shares have not otherwise vested in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, but the Committee determined that the Company achieved at least the Threshold Amount (as defined below) of both the Performance Goals with respect to the 2017 fiscal year, then the percentage of Shares that vest as of the date of such determination will be determined as follows:

(i) If the Target Amount was not achieved with respect to either Performance Goal with respect to the 2017 Fiscal Year and exactly the Threshold Amount of both goals was achieved, then 50% of the Shares will vest, and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date; and

(ii) If the Target Amount was achieved with respect to one, but not both, Performance Goals, and exactly the Threshold Amount was achieved on the other Performance Goal with respect to the 2017 Fiscal Year, then 75% of the Shares will vest, and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date. 

If the level of achievement of a Performance Goal is between the Threshold Amount and the Target Amount, linear interpolation, weighting each Performance Goal equally, will be applied to determine the percentage of Shares that vest and corresponding Dividends to be paid or distributed.

Miscellaneous.

The date on which any Shares vest pursuant to this Award is referred to as the “Vesting Date.”

Refer to Attachment A attached hereto and incorporated herein, which provides examples of the foregoing.

Performance Criteria:

The Performance Criteria consists of the Operating Margin and Total Revenue Goals set forth below (together, the “Performance Goals”):  
  
Operating Margin:

“Threshold Amount”: 10.50%

“Target Amount”: 11.0%

For purposes of this Agreement, in any given fiscal year, “Operating Margin” means the quotient of (A) the Company’s earnings during such fiscal year, before taxes and interest (“EBIT”), as the numerator, and (B) the Company’s consolidated net sales during such fiscal year (“Net Sales”), as the denominator, which quotient is expressed as a percentage.

Except as set forth under the section entitled “Extraordinary Corporate Events” below, for purposes of determining the Operating Margin of the Company in any given fiscal year, the operating results of any business acquired by the Company, whether by stock, asset, merger or other transaction, shall be consolidated with the Operating Margin of the Company from the date of the acquisition. For the avoidance of doubt, the historical operating results of such acquired business prior to the acquisition shall not be consolidated with the Operating Margin of the Company.  
  
Total Revenue:

“Threshold Amount”: $10,000,000,000

“Target Amount”: $12,000,000,000

For purposes of this Agreement, in any given year, “Total Revenue” means the Company’s Net Sales.

Except as set forth under the section entitled “Extraordinary Corporate Events” below, for purposes of determining the Net Sales of the Company in any given fiscal year, the operating results of any business acquired by the Company, whether by stock, asset, merger or other transaction, shall be consolidated with the Net Sales of the Company from the date of the acquisition.

Termination of Employment; Failure to Remain a Qualifying Employee:

Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary:

(a) If the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee terminates by reason of the Grantee’s death or total and permanent disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) while Grantee is a Qualifying Employee, the Award shall vest on the Vesting Date, in such amount as if the Grantee had continued as a Qualifying Employee through the Vesting Date. 

(b) If the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee terminates by reason of the Grantee’s Retirement (defined as a voluntary Termination by Grantee on or after attainment of age 55 with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of service) while Grantee is a Qualifying Employee, then so long as Grantee has served as a Qualifying Employee for at least one (1) year of the Performance Period, the Award shall vest on the Vesting Date in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares that would have vested if Grantee had continued as a Qualifying Employee through the Vesting Date and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months (counting February 3, 2013 to February 28, 2013 as a full calendar month) of active service that Grantee served as a Qualifying Employee during the period between February 3, 2013 and the Vesting Date and the denominator of which is the total number of months during the period between February 3, 2013 and the Vesting Date. 

(c) If, for any reason other than Grantee’s death, total and permanent disability or Retirement while a Qualifying Employee, the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee terminates prior to the Vesting Date, the Award shall, unless otherwise specified by the Company, be automatically forfeited and no Shares shall vest.

(d) If on the Vesting Date, the Grantee ceases to be a Qualifying Employee prior to the Vesting Date, but maintains Continuous Status as an Employee, then so long as Grantee has served as a Qualifying Employee for at least one (1) year of the Performance Period, the Award shall vest on the Vesting Date in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares that would have vested if Grantee had continued as a Qualifying Employee through the Vesting Date and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months (counting February 3, 2013 to February 28, 2013 as a full calendar month) of active service that Grantee served as a Qualifying Employee during the period between February 3, 2013 and the Vesting Date and the denominator of which is the total number of months during the period between February 3, 2013 and the Vesting Date.

“Qualifying Employee” means an Employee that maintains Continuous Status as an Employee and has not been demoted to a position with decreased duties, responsibilities and/or authority from the position he/she holds as of the date of this Agreement.

Extraordinary Corporate Events:

Large Acquisition Transaction or Change in Control. In the event that either (1) the Company acquires, whether by stock, asset, merger or other transaction, any business that has consolidated revenue of $2 billion or more, based on the greater of such business’s last completed fiscal year or trailing twelve months from the Acquisition Date (as defined below), and such transaction does not result in a Change in Control (a “Large Acquisition Transaction”), or (2) or a Change in Control, then a percentage of Shares shall vest on the date of the consummation of such Large Acquisition Transaction or Change in Control (the “Acquisition Date”). The percentage of Shares that vest on the Acquisition Date will be based on the level of the Company’s achievement of the Performance Goals as of the end of the last completed fiscal year preceding the Acquisition Date, as determined by the Compensation Committee, compared against the target and threshold amounts of the Performance Goals for such fiscal year as set forth in Attachment B. The historical operating results of the acquired company shall not be consolidated with the operating results of the Company in determining the level of the Company’s achievement of the Performance Goals for the purposes of the provisions under this section “Large Acquisition Transaction”.

(i) If the Committee determines that the target amount of the Performance Goals for such fiscal year was achieved for both Performance Goals, then 100% of a number of Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to this Award and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months (counting February 3, 2013 to February 28, 2013 as a full calendar month) between February 3, 2013 and the end of the last completed fiscal year and the denominator of which is 60, will vest; and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date.

(ii) If the target amount of the Performance Goals for such fiscal year was not achieved for either Performance Goal, but exactly the threshold amount of such Performance Goals for such fiscal year was achieved for both Performance Goals, then 50% of a number of Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to this Award and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months (counting February 3, 2013 to February 28, 2013 as a full calendar month) between February 3, 2013 and the end of the last completed fiscal year and the denominator of which is 60, will vest, and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date.

(iii) If the target amount of Performance Goals for such fiscal year was achieved with respect to one, but not both, Performance Goals, and exactly the threshold amount of the Performance Goals for such fiscal year was achieved on the other Performance Goal, then 75% of a number of Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to this Award and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months (counting February 3, 2013 to February 28, 2013 as a full calendar month) between February 3, 2013 and the end of the last completed fiscal year and the denominator of which is 60, will vest, and any Dividends with respect to such Shares shall be paid or distributed on such date.

If the level of achievement of a Performance Goal for such fiscal year is between the threshold amount and the target amount for such fiscal year, linear interpolation, weighting each Performance Goal equally, will be applied to determine the percentage of Shares that vest and corresponding Dividends to be paid or distributed.

Taxes, Withholding and Section 83(b) Election:

Grantee shall be solely responsible for any taxes payable on the receipt of transfer of vesting of the Shares.

Additionally, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to withhold from Grantee the number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the federal, state and local tax withholding requirements associated with this Award.

Dividends are considered ordinary income and will be included on Grantee’s W-2 in the year of vesting. Additionally, taxes will be calculated and deducted from the total amount of dividend payment income. To the extent required for compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, if applicable to Grantee, the Committee shall have such authority and make such determination over the Award as necessary to comply with the terms of the Plan and Section 162(m) of the Code.
