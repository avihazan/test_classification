(b) Vesting upon Termination. If, prior to [ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GRANT DATE], other than by virtue of removal from the Board of Directors (the “Board”) for cause, you incur a termination of service in respect of the service on the Board and/or a committee of the Board for which this grant was made then, upon such termination of service, a number of such shares equal to the product of (A) the number of shares granted in connection with the Board and/or committee service that was terminated (which such number is set forth in the minutes of the Board meeting held on [●]) and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days elapsed between [GRANT DATE] and the date of your applicable termination of Board and/or committee service by (y) 365 shall vest, and the remaining unvested shares granted in connection with such Board and/or committee service shall be automatically forfeited.

  


2. Non-Transferability of Award. During the period before the Shares vest, you may not assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares prior to vesting. Any attempt to assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the unvested Shares contrary to the provisions hereof, and the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon the unvested Shares, shall be null and void and without effect.

3. Right to Vote and to Receive Dividends. You will have the right to vote unvested Shares and receive any cash dividends or other cash distributions paid on unvested Shares.
