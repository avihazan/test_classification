Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement   
Under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated June 9, 2016)

  


Pursuant to that certain employment agreement, dated as of August 8, 2016 (as it may be further amended and restated, the “Employment Agreement”), between you and Walter Investment Management Corp., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), the Company agreed to grant you an award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with an economic value determined as of the Commencement Date (as defined in the Employment Agreement) equal to $600,000 (the “Award”) in connection with your assumption of responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company on the Commencement Date.

This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (as it may be further amended and restated, this “Agreement”) under the Company’s 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated June 9, 2016) (as it may be further amended and restated, the “Plan”), together with the Plan, contains the terms and conditions of the Award and is in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligation to grant the Award to you as set forth in the Employment Agreement.

Participant: Anthony Renzi_____________________________

Commencement Date: September 12, 2016________________

Number of RSUs Granted:  175,438 

Vesting Dates: The first, second, and third anniversaries of the Commencement Date, subject to Section 1 below.

THIS AGREEMENT, effective as of the Commencement Date, represents the grant of RSUs by the Company to the Participant named above, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. 

The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant the Award provided for in the Employment Agreement and this Agreement to the Participant, pursuant to the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. 

The Plan provides a complete description of the terms and conditions governing this Award and the underlying RSUs. If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, other than with respect to the definitions of the terms “Cause” and “Disability” as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the Plan’s terms shall completely supersede and replace the conflicting terms of this Agreement. All capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan or on Exhibit A hereto, unless specifically set forth otherwise herein. The parties hereto agree as follows:  
  
1.

Employment with the Company. Except as may otherwise be provided in Section 5 or Section 6 below, the RSUs granted hereunder will become vested in substantially equal installments subject to the condition that the Participant remains an employee of the Company from the Commencement Date through (and including) each applicable Vesting Date and will be settled in

* * *

  


accordance with Section 2 below; provided, that if the number of RSUs is not evenly divisible by three, then no fractional units shall vest and the installments shall be as equal as possible with the smaller installment(s) vesting first. If the Participant remains employed by the Company through each applicable Vesting Date, payment of the relevant installment of the Award will occur irrespective of whether the Participant is employed by the Company on the payment date. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in the Employment Agreement, this grant of RSUs shall not confer any right to the Participant to be granted RSUs or other awards in the future under the Plan.  
  
2.

Timing of Payout. Payout of any vested RSUs (and any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents thereon) shall occur as soon as administratively feasible after (but in all events prior to March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the applicable event occurs) the earliest to occur of (a) the applicable Vesting Date, (b) the date of the Participant’s termination of employment due to death or Disability, (c) the date of the Participant’s termination of employment (x) by the Company without Cause (other than due to death or Disability), (y) by the Company due to non-renewal of the term of employment under the Employment Agreement, or (z) by the Participant for Good Reason, or (d) a Change in Control; unless, in the case of (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 2, the Participant irrevocably elects to voluntarily defer the payout of RSUs to a specific date or event as approved by the Committee and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  
  
3.

Form of Payout. Each vested RSU will be paid out solely in the form of one Share.  
  
4.

Voting Rights and Dividends Equivalents. Until such time as the RSUs are paid out in Shares, the Participant shall not have voting rights with respect to the RSUs. However, the Company will pay dividend equivalents on the RSUs, in the same form (e.g., cash, stock, a combination of cash and stock, or such other dividend as shall be determined by the Company) paid on the Company’s outstanding Shares. All dividend equivalents will be accrued as of the time such dividend equivalents are paid on the Company’s outstanding Shares, however, such dividend equivalents will not be earned or payable to the Participant unless and until such time as the RSUs to which such dividend equivalents apply are settled as provided for in Section 2 above.   
  
5.

Termination of Employment.   
  
(a)

By Death or Disability. In the event the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates due to the Participant’s death or Disability, in each case, prior to the final Vesting Date, any unvested RSUs (and any dividend equivalents accrued thereon pursuant to this Agreement) shall become immediately fully vested and settled in accordance with Section 2 above.  
  
(b)

By the Company Without Cause (other than due to death or Disability), due to Non-Renewal of the Term of Employment by the Company, or by the Participant for Good Reason. In the event the Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated (i) by the Company without Cause (other than due to death or Disability), (ii) by the Company due to non-renewal of the term of employment under the Employment Agreement, or (iii) by the Participant for Good Reason, in each case, prior to the final Vesting Date, any unvested RSUs (and any dividend equivalents accrued thereon pursuant to this Agreement) shall become immediately fully vested and settled in accordance with Section 2 above.  
  
(c)

For Cause. In the event the Participant’s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause prior to the final Vesting Date (or the payout date relating to a Vesting Date), the Participant shall forfeit any outstanding RSUs and any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents thereon.

(d)

For Other Reasons. If the Participant’s employment terminates for any reason prior to the final Vesting Date (other than as provided for above), the Participant shall forfeit any outstanding RSUs and any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents thereon.  
  
6.

Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control that occurs prior to the final Vesting Date (or the payout date relating to the final Vesting Date), and provided that prior to such Change in Control the Participant’s employment with the Company has not terminated, any unvested RSUs (and any dividend equivalents accrued thereon pursuant to this Agreement) shall become immediately fully vested and settled in accordance with Section 2 above.   
  
7.

Restrictions on Transfer. Subject to Committee discretion, unless and until actual Shares are received upon payout, RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except as provided in the Plan.  
  
8.

Recapitalization. In the event of any corporate event or transaction, including, but not limited to, a change in the Shares or the capitalization of the Company, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the number and class of Shares subject to this Award shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee, as determined in its sole discretion, in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights.  
  
9.

Beneficiary Designation. The Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Agreement is to be paid in case of the Participant’s death before the Participant receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Secretary of the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant’s death shall be paid to the Participant’s estate.  
  
10.

Continuation of Employment. This Agreement shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor shall this Agreement interfere in any way with the Company’s right to terminate the Participant’s employment with the Company at any time.  
  
11.

Miscellaneous.  
  
(a)

This Agreement and the rights of the Participant hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. The Committee shall have the right to impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed and/or traded, and under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

To the extent not preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland.
