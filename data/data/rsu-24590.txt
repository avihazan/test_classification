The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Participant is responsible for the tax consequences associated with the grant of the Option and its exercise.   
  
5. Changes in Company’s Capital Structure.   
  
(a) Adjustment in Authorized Stock. As may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its complete and sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, the Committee shall make or authorize to be made an adjustment in the number and class of Option and/or the Option Price to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, as a result of the following:

6. Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete. The Participant agrees to, understands and acknowledges the following:

For purposes of this Option Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any and all financial, technical, commercial or other information concerning the business and affairs of the Company that is confidential and proprietary to the Company, including without limitation,   
  
(i) information relating to the Company’s past and existing customers and vendors and development of prospective customers and vendors, including specific customer product requirements, pricing arrangements, payments terms, customer lists and other similar information;   
  
(ii) inventions, designs, methods, discoveries, works of authorship, creations, improvements or ideas developed or otherwise produced, acquired or used by the Company;   
  
(iii) the Company’s proprietary programs, processes or software, consisting of but not limited to, computer programs in source or object code and all related documentation and training materials, including all upgrades, updates, improvements, derivatives and modifications thereof and including programs and documentation in incomplete stages of design or research and development;   
  
(iv) the subject matter of the Company’s patents, design patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress, manuals, operating instructions, training materials, and other industrial property, including such information in incomplete stages of design or research and development; and

* * *

The Company devotes significant financial, human and other resources to the development of its products, its customer base and the general goodwill associated with its business, and the Company diligently maintains the secrecy and confidentiality of its Confidential Information. Each and every component of the Confidential Information is sufficiently secret to derive economic value from its not being generally known to other persons. While serving on the Board and thereafter, the Participant will hold in the strictest confidence and not use in any manner which is detrimental to the Company or disclose to any individual or entity any Confidential Information, except as may be required by the Company in connection with the Participant’s service on the Board. 

All Company Materials are and will be the sole property of the Company. The Participant agrees that during and after his or her service on the Board, the Participant will not remove any Company Materials from the business premises of the Company or deliver any Company Materials to any person or entity outside the Company, except as the Participant is required to do so in connection with performing the duties as a member of the Board. The Participant further agrees that, immediately upon the termination of his or her service on the Board for any reason, or during the Participant’s tenure as a member of the Board if so requested by the Company, the Participant will return all Company Materials and other physical property, and any reproduction thereof, excepting only the Participant’s copy of this Agreement. For purposes of this Option Agreement, “Company Materials” means documents or other media or tangible items that contain or embody Confidential Information or any other information concerning the business, operations or future/strategic plans of the Company, whether such documents have been prepared by the Participant or by others. 

(b) Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete. For the period beginning on the date hereof and ending twelve (12) months following the Participant’s termination of service on the Board, the Participant will not directly or indirectly:   
  
(i) employ, recruit or solicit for employment any person who is (or was within the six (6) months prior to the date the Participant’s service on the Board terminated) an employee of the Company;   
  
(ii) accept employment, serve on the board of directors of, or engage in a competing business which may require contact, solicitation, interference or diverting of any of the Company’s customers, or that may result in the disclosure, divulging, or other use, of Confidential Information or Company Materials acquired during the Participant’s service on the Board; or   
  
(iii) solicit or encourage any customer, vendor or potential customer or vendor of the Company with whom the Participant had contact while serving on the Board to terminate or otherwise alter his, her or its relationship with the Company. The Participant understands that any person or entity that the Participant contacted during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the Participant’s termination of service on the Board for the purpose of soliciting sales from such person or entity shall be regarded as a “potential customer” of the Company to whom the Company has a protectible proprietary interest.   
  
(c) Remedies for Violation.  
  
(i) Injunctive Action. The Participant acknowledges that if he or she violates the terms of this Section 6, the injury that would be suffered by the Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Option Agreement (including any provision of Section 6 (a) or (b) hereof) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Option Agreement, and the Company will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Without limiting the Company’s rights under this Section 6(c) (or Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof) or any other remedies of the Company, if the Participant breaches any of the provisions of Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof, the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to the Participant under this Option Agreement.

(ii) Forfeiture of the Option and Repayment. In addition to the rights available to the Company under Section 6(c)(i) hereof, if the Participant violates the terms of this Section 6 at any time, the Participant, without any further action by the Company or the Participant, shall forfeit, as of the first day of any such violation, all right, title and interest to this Option, any Option Shares then owned by the Participant and any net proceeds received by the Participant pursuant to any sales or transfer of any Option Shares prior to, on or after such date, and the Company shall have the right to issue a stop transfer order and other appropriate instructions to its transfer agent with respect to this Option and the Option Shares, and the Company further shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Participant of any fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the Company’s rights under this Section 6. By accepting this Option, the Participant hereby consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes to the Participant from time to time (unless such amounts is subject to Code Section 409A), to the extent of any amounts that the Participant owes the Company under this Section 6. In addition to any injunctive relief sought under Section 6(c)(i) hereof and whether or not the Company elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount the Participant owes to the Company, calculated as set forth in this Section 6(c)(ii), the Participant agrees to immediately pay the unpaid balance to the Company.   
  
(d) Enforceability of Restrictive Covenants. The scope and duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Option Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate, protectible interest of the Company. However, if one or more provisions of this Option Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law to any extent, such provision(s) shall, to that extent, be excluded from this Option Agreement and the balance of the Option Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision(s) were so excluded to that extent and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.   
  
(e) Written Acknowledgement by the Participant. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may require the Participant, as a condition to the exercise of this Option, to acknowledge in writing that he or she has not engaged, and is not in the process of engaging, in any of the activities described in this Section 6.   
  
7. Miscellaneous Provisions.   
  
(a) No Service or Employment Rights. No provision of this Option Agreement or of the Option granted hereunder shall give the Participant any right to continue to serve on the Board or in the service or employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, create any inference as to the length of employment or service of the Participant, affect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of the Participant, with or without Cause, or give the Participant any right to participate in any employee welfare or benefit plan or other program (other than the Plan) of the Company or any Subsidiary.   
  
(b) Stockholder Rights. Until the Option shall have been duly exercised to purchase Option Shares and such shares have been officially recorded as issued on the Company’s official stockholder records, no person or entity shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of such Option Shares, and adjustments for dividends or otherwise shall be made only if the record date therefore is subsequent to the date such shares are recorded and after the date of exercise and without duplication of any adjustment.   
  
(c) Plan Document Governs. The Option is granted pursuant to the Plan, and the Option and this Option Agreement are in all respects governed by the Plan and subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof, whether such terms and provisions are incorporated in this Option Agreement by reference or are expressly cited.
