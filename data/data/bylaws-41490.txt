Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

(c) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, a director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director’s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock – Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in the Amended and Restated Articles (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the BCA as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 

Section 8.2 Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “proceeding”) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an “indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 8.2 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Section 8.2 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(a), except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

4  
  
(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, the Amended and Restated Articles, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the shareholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of the Amended and Restated Articles inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(d) This Section 8.2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

ARTICLE IX

BUSINESS COMBINATION REQUIREMENTS; EXISTENCE

Section 9.1 General.

(a) The provisions of this Article IX shall apply during the period commencing upon the effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Articles and terminating upon the consummation of the Corporation’s initial Business Combination and no amendment to this Article IX shall be effective prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.

(b) Immediately after the Offering, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds received by the Corporation in the Offering (including the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) and certain other amounts specified in the Corporation’s registration statement on Form S-1, as initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2016, as amended (the “Registration Statement”), shall be deposited in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), established for the benefit of the Public Shareholders (as defined below) pursuant to a trust agreement described in the Registration Statement (the “Trust Agreement”). Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes and for working capital purposes (including repayment from interest of loans made to the Corporation by the Sponsor or application of withdrawn or accrued interest to the Sponsors’ obligation to loan the Corporation money in connection with an extension described in Section 9.1(c) below), none of the funds held in the Trust Account (including the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) the redemption of 100% of the Offering Shares (as defined below) if the Corporation is unable to complete its initial Business Combination by the applicable Termination Date (as defined below). Holders of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock included as part of the units sold in the Offering (the “Offering Shares”) (whether such Offering Shares were purchased in the Offering or in the secondary market following the Offering and whether or not such holders are affiliates of Astra Maritime Corp., Dominium Investments Inc., Magellan Investments Corp. or Firmus Investments Inc. (the “Sponsors”) or officers or directors of the Corporation) are referred to herein as “Public Shareholders.”

5  
  
(c) In the event that the Corporation has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 12 months from the date of the closing of the Offering, the Board of Directors may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to three times (the latest such date, the “Termination Date”), each by an additional three months, for an aggregate of nine additional months, provided that (i) for each such extension the Sponsors (or their designees) must deposit into the Trust Account $379,167 (or up to $436,042 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) per extension in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note, for maximum aggregate proceeds to the Corporation of $1,137,501 (or up to $1,308,126 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) if three extensions occur and (ii) the procedures relating to any such extension, as set forth in the Trust Agreement, shall have been complied with. The gross proceeds from the issuance of such promissory notes will be added to the proceeds from the Offering to be held in the Trust Account and shall be used to fund the redemption of the Offering Shares in accordance with Section 9.2. In the event that interest in the trust is available for withdrawal for working capital purposes, and has not been used to pay taxes or other working capital expenses, the Corporation may apply accrued interest in the trust account or such withdrawn interest to the Sponsors' obligation to loan money to the Corporation in connection with an extension of the period of time during which the Corporation must consummate a Business Combination, and the amount that the Sponsors would be obligated to loan to the Corporation in connection with such extension would be reduced by the amount of interest so applied.

Section 9.2 Redemption and Repurchase Rights.

(a) Prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall provide all holders of Offering Shares with the opportunity to have their Offering Shares redeemed or repurchased upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) (such rights of such holders to have their Offering Shares redeemed or repurchased pursuant to such Sections, the “Redemption Rights”) hereof for cash equal to the applicable redemption or repurchase price per share determined in accordance with Section 9.2(b) hereof (the “Redemption Price”); provided, however, that the Corporation shall not redeem or repurchase Offering Shares to the extent that such redemption or repurchase would result in the Corporation having net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of less than $5,000,001 (such limitation hereinafter called the “Redemption Limitation”) upon consummation of the Business Combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Amended and Restated Articles, there shall be no Redemption Rights or liquidating distributions with respect to any warrant issued pursuant to the Offering.

(b) (i) Repurchase Rights. Unless the Corporation offers to redeem the Offering Shares as described in Section 9.2(b)(ii), it shall offer to repurchase the Offering Shares pursuant to a tender offer in accordance with Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act (such rules and regulations hereinafter called the “Tender Offer Rules”) which it shall commence prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination and shall file tender offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the Redemption Rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act (such rules and regulations hereinafter called the “Proxy Solicitation Rules”), even if such information is not required under the Tender Offer Rules. If the Corporation offers to repurchase the Offering Shares (and has not otherwise withdrawn the tender offer), the Redemption Price per share of the Common Stock payable to holders of the Offering Shares tendering their Offering Shares pursuant to such tender offer shall be equal to, subject to the Redemption Limitation, the quotient obtained by dividing: (i) the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the date of the commencement of the tender offer, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to the Corporation), by (ii) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares. 

6  
  
(ii) Redemption Rights. If a stockholder vote is required by law to approve the proposed initial Business Combination or the Corporation decides to hold a stockholder vote on the proposed initial Business Combination for business or other legal reasons, the Corporation shall offer to redeem the Offering Shares at a Redemption Price per share of the Common Stock payable to holders of the Offering Shares exercising their Redemption Rights (irrespective of whether they voted in favor or against the Business Combination) equal to, subject to the Redemption Limitation, the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to the Corporation), by (b) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares.

(c) If the Corporation offers to redeem the Offering Shares in conjunction with a stockholder vote on an initial Business Combination pursuant to a proxy solicitation, a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), shall be restricted from seeking Redemption Rights with respect to 26% or more of the Offering Shares.

(d) In the event that the Corporation has not consummated a Business Combination by the applicable Termination Date, the Corporation shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to the Corporation and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Corporation’s obligations under the BCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law.

(e) If the Corporation offers to redeem the Offering Shares in conjunction with a stockholder vote on an initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall consummate the proposed Business Combination only if (i) such initial Business Combination is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Common Stock that are voted at a stockholder meeting held to consider such initial Business Combination and (ii) the Redemption Limitation is not exceeded.

Section 9.3 Distributions from the Trust Account.

(a) A Public Stockholder shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only as provided in Sections 9.2(a), 9.2(b), 9.2(d) or 9.7 hereof. In no other circumstances shall a Public Stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to distributions from the Trust Account, and no stockholder other than a Public Stockholder shall have any interest in or to the Trust Account.

(b) Each Public Stockholder that does not exercise its Redemption Rights shall retain its interest in the Corporation and shall be deemed to have given its consent to the release of the remaining funds in the Trust Account to the Corporation, and following payment to any Public Shareholders exercising their Redemption Rights, the remaining funds in the Trust Account shall be released to the Corporation.

(c) The exercise by a Public Stockholder of the Redemption Rights shall be conditioned on such Public Stockholder following the specific procedures for redemptions set forth by the Corporation in any applicable tender offer or proxy materials sent to the Corporation’s Public Shareholders relating to the proposed initial Business Combination. Payment of the amounts necessary to satisfy the Redemption Rights properly exercised shall be made as promptly as practical after the consummation of the initial Business Combination. A Public Shareholder must follow any procedures specified in the Registration Statement or proxy solicitation, or tender offer, materials in order to redeem any Offering Shares.

7  
  
Section 9.4 Share Issuances. Prior to the consummation of the Corporation’s initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall not issue any additional shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the Trust Account or vote on any Business Combination. 

Section 9.5 Transactions with Affiliates. In the event the Corporation enters into an initial Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with the Sponsor, or the directors or officers of the Corporation, the Corporation, or a committee of the independent directors of the Corporation, shall obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a qualified independent accounting firm that such Business Combination is fair to the Corporation from a financial point of view.

Section 9.6 No Transactions with Other Blank Check Companies. The Corporation shall not enter into a Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.

Section 9.7 Additional Redemption Rights. If, in accordance with Section 9.1(a), any amendment is made to Section 9.2(d) that would affect the substance or timing of the Corporation’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Offering Shares if the Corporation has not consummated a Business Combination by the applicable Termination Date, the Public Shareholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any such amendment, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to the Corporation), divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares. No such amendment may be made to Section 9.2(d) if the redemption of Offering Shares provided pursuant to this Section 9.7 would result in the Corporation having net tangible assets of less than the Redemption Limitation.

Section 9.8 Minimum Value of Target. So long as the Corporation’s securities are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Corporation’s Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Business Combination.
