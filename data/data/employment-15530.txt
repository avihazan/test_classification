(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Employers at any time from terminating the Executive's employment during the term of this Agreement for any reason, provided that the relative rights and obligations of the Employers and the Executive in the event of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement.

(c) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Employers and the implementation of all accounting policies of the Employers.

In addition, the Executive shall perform such executive services for the Employers as may be consistent with his titles and from time to time assigned to him by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Employers.

3\. Compensation and Benefits.

(a) The Employers shall compensate and pay the Executive for his services during the term of this Agreement at a minimum base salary of $163,000 per year (“Base Salary”), which may be increased from time to time in such amounts as may be mutually determined by the Boards of Directors of the Employers and may not be decreased without the Executive's express written consent.

The Employers shall not make any changes in such plans, benefits or privileges which would adversely affect the Executive's rights or benefits thereunder, unless such change occurs pursuant to a program applicable to all executive officers of the Employers and does not result in a proportionately greater adverse change in the rights of or benefits to the Executive as compared with any other executive officer of the Employers. Nothing paid to the Executive under any plan or arrangement presently in effect or made available in the future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable to the Executive pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof.

* * *

(d) The Executive's compensation, benefits, severance and expenses shall be paid by the Corporation and the Bank in the same proportion as the time and services actually expended by the Executive on behalf of each respective Employer; provided, however, that if the Executive devotes less than 10% of his time to the Corporation, all of such amounts shall be paid by the Bank. No provision contained in this Agreement shall require the Bank to pay any portion of the Executive’s compensation, benefits, severance and expenses required to be paid by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement.

4. Expenses. The Employers shall reimburse the Executive or otherwise provide for or pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in furtherance of or in connection with the business of the Employers, including, but not by way of limitation, automobile expenses and traveling expenses, and all reasonable entertainment expenses (whether incurred at the Executive's residence, while traveling or otherwise), subject to such reasonable documentation and policies as may be established by the Boards of Directors of the Employers. If such expenses are paid in the first instance by the Executive, the Employers shall reimburse the Executive therefor. Such reimbursement shall be paid promptly by the Employers and in any event no later than March 15 of the year immediately following the year in which such expenses were incurred.

5\. Termination.

(a) The Employers shall have the right, at any time upon prior Notice of Termination, to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, including without limitation termination for Cause, Disability or Retirement, and the Executive shall have the right, upon prior Notice of Termination, to terminate his employment hereunder for any reason.

(b) In the event that (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Employers for Cause or (ii) the Executive terminates his employment hereunder other than for Disability, Retirement, death or Good Reason, the Executive shall have no right pursuant to this Agreement to compensation or other benefits for any period after the applicable Date of Termination.

(c) In the event that the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of Disability, Retirement or the Executive's death during the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall have no right pursuant to this Agreement to compensation or other benefits for any period after the applicable Date of Termination.

(d) In the event that prior to a Change in Control (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Employers for other than Cause, Disability, Retirement or the Executive's death or (ii) such employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Employers shall:

(A) pay to the Executive, in a lump sum as of the Date of Termination, a cash severance amount equal to one (1) times his Base Salary, and

5

* * *

(B) maintain and provide for a period ending at the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months after the Date of Termination or (ii) the date of the Executive's full-time employment by another employer (provided that the Executive is entitled under the terms of such employment to benefits substantially similar to those described in this subparagraph (B)), at no cost to the Executive, the continued participation of the Executive and his dependents in all group insurance, life insurance, health and accident insurance, and disability insurance offered by the Employers in which the Executive and his dependents were participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 5(f) below.

(e) In the event that either concurrently with or following a Change in Control (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Employers for other than Cause, Disability, Retirement or the Executive's death or (ii) such employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Employers shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, if applicable,

(A) pay to the Executive, in a lump sum as of the Date of Termination, a cash severance amount equal to two (2) times his Annual Compensation, and

(B) maintain and provide for a period ending at the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months after the Date of Termination or (ii) the date of the Executive's full-time employment by another employer (provided that the Executive is entitled under the terms of such employment to benefits substantially similar to those described in this subparagraph (B)), at no cost to the Executive, the continued participation of the Executive and his dependents in all group insurance, life insurance, health and accident insurance, and disability insurance offered by the Employers in which the Executive and his dependents were participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 5(f) below.

(f) Any insurance premiums payable by the Employers or any successors pursuant to this Section 5 shall be payable at such times and in such amounts (except that the Employers shall also pay any employee portion of the premiums) as if the Executive was still an employee of the Employers, subject to any increases in such amounts imposed by the insurance company or COBRA, and the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Employers in any taxable year shall not affect the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Employers in any other taxable year; provided, however, that if the Executive’s participation in any group insurance plan is barred, the Employers shall either arrange to provide the Executive with insurance benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive was entitled to receive under such group insurance plan or, if such coverage cannot be obtained, pay a lump sum cash equivalency amount within thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination based on the annualized rate of premiums being paid by the Employers as of the Date of Termination.

6. Limitation of Benefits under Certain Circumstances. If the payments and benefits pursuant to Section 5 hereof, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the Employers, would constitute a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, then the payments and benefits payable by the Employers pursuant to Section 5 hereof shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits payable by the Employers under Section 5 being non-deductible to the Employers pursuant to Section 280G of the Code and subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. In no event shall the payments and benefits payable under Section 5 exceed three times the Executive’s average taxable income from the Employers for the five calendar years preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, with any benefits to be provided subsequent to the Date of Termination to be discounted to present value in accordance with Section 280G of the Code. If the payments and benefits under Section 5 are required to be reduced, the cash severance shall be reduced first, followed by a reduction in the fringe benefits. The determination of any reduction in the payments and benefits to be made pursuant to Section 5 shall be based upon the opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Employers and paid by the Employers. Such counsel shall promptly prepare the foregoing opinion, but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the Date of Termination, and may use such actuaries as such counsel deems necessary or advisable for the purpose. Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall result in a reduction of any payments or benefits to which the Executive may be entitled upon termination of employment under any circumstances other than as specified in this Section 6, or a reduction in the payments and benefits specified in Section 5 below zero.

6

* * *

7\. Mitigation; Exclusivity of Benefits.

(a) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any benefits hereunder by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any such benefits be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as a result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise, except as set forth in Sections 5(d)(B)(ii) and 5(e)(B)(ii) above.

(b) The specific arrangements referred to herein are not intended to exclude any other benefits which may be available to the Executive upon a termination of employment with the Employers pursuant to employee benefit plans of the Employers or otherwise.

8. Withholding. All payments required to be made by the Employers hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Employers shall determine are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

9. Assignability. The Employers may assign this Agreement and their rights and obligations hereunder in whole, but not in part, to any corporation, bank or other entity with or into which the Employers may hereafter merge or consolidate or to which the Employers may transfer all or substantially all of their assets, if in any such case said corporation, bank or other entity shall by operation of law or expressly in writing assume all obligations of the Employers hereunder as fully as if it had been originally made a party hereto, but may not otherwise assign this Agreement or their rights and obligations hereunder. The Executive may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder.

10. Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth below:
