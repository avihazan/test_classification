Purchase and Closing

Section 1.01 Purchase.

(a) Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase from Seller at the Closing (as defined below) the Shares at $7.97 per share (the “Purchase Price Per Share”) for the aggregate purchase price set forth on the signature page hereto (the “Aggregate Purchase Price”). Following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees to provide irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, to deliver the Aggregate Purchase Price at the Closing. Buyer’s obligation to purchase the Shares from Seller shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Acquisition.

(b) If, at any time following the execution of this Agreement the market price of the Shares exceeds the pro rata amount due a stockholder of Buyer who elects to exercise its Redemption Rights, Seller may sell some or all of the Shares in the market (a “Sale”); provided, however, any such Sale shall only reduce the number of Shares covered by this Agreement and the Aggregate Purchase thereof as a result of such Sale. In the event of a Sale, each of the other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall terminate only in accordance with Section 7.01.

Section 1.02 Closing. The Buyer shall initiate the liquidation of Buyer’s Trust Account as soon as practicable following the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Acquisition and (ii) November 29, 2009. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (“Closing”) will occur as soon as practicable, but in no event more than (1) business day after: (i) the liquidation of Buyer’s Trust Account in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition and (ii) the settlement of all (and not less than all) of the Shares following Seller’s delivery of the Shares to an account specified by Buyer using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the Aggregate Purchase Price by wire transfer from Camden’s Trust Account of immediately available funds to an account specified by Seller. It shall be a condition to the obligation of Buyer on the one hand and Seller on the other hand, to consummate the transfer of the Shares and payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price contemplated hereunder that the other party’s representations and warranties are true and correct at the Closing with the same effect as though made on such date, unless waived in writing by the party to whom such representations and warranties are made.
