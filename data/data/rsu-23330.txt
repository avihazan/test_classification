The Award Recipient understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock as of the date any restrictions on the shares lapse. The Award Recipient understands that he or she may elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Stock is granted rather than upon vesting by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within thirty days from the date of grant. The Award Recipient acknowledges that it is his or her sole responsibility, and not the Company's, to timely file any such election.

If any term or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall at any time or to any extent be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect as written, the Award Recipient and the Company intend for any court construing this Agreement to modify or limit such provision so as to render it valid and enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. Any such provision that is not susceptible of such reformation shall be ignored so as to not affect any other term or provision hereof, and the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
