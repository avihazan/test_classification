* * *

The Company and its Subsidiaries devote significant financial, human and other resources to the development of their products, customer base and the general goodwill associated with its business, and the Company and its Subsidiaries diligently maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of their Confidential Information. Each and every component of the Confidential Information is sufficiently secret to derive economic value from its not being generally known to other persons. While employed by the Company and/or Subsidiary and thereafter, the Participant will hold in the strictest confidence and not use in any manner which is detrimental to the Company or its Subsidiaries or disclose to any individual or entity any Confidential Information, except as may be required by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Participant’s employment. 

All Company Materials are and will be the sole property of the Company and/or Subsidiary. The Participant agrees that during and after his or her employment by the Company and/or Subsidiary, the Participant will not remove any Company Materials from the business premises of the Company or a Subsidiary or deliver any Company Materials to any person or entity outside the Company or a Subsidiary, except as the Participant is required to do so in connection with performing the duties of his or her employment. The Participant further agrees that, immediately upon the termination of his or her employment for any reason, or during the Participant’s employment if so requested by the Company, the Participant will return all Company Materials and other physical property, and any reproduction thereof, excepting only the Participant’s copy of this Agreement. For purposes of this Stock Agreement, “Company Materials” means documents or other media or tangible items that contain or embody Confidential Information or any other information concerning the business, operations or future/strategic plans of the Company and/or any Subsidiary, whether such documents have been prepared by the Participant or by others. 

(b) Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete. Notwithstanding any provision of this Stock Agreement, if at any time prior to the date that is one year after the date of vesting of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock, the Participant, directly or indirectly: 

(i) breaches or violates Section 6(a) of this Stock Agreement; or 

(ii) employs, recruits or solicits for employment any person who is (or was within the six (6) months prior to the Participant’s employment termination date) an employee of the Company and/or any Subsidiary; or 

(iii) accepts employment or engages in a competing business that may require contact, solicitation, interference or diverting of any of the Company’s or any Subsidiary’s customers, or that may result in the disclosure, divulging, or other use, of Confidential Information or Company Materials acquired during the Participant’s employment with the Company or any Subsidiary; or 

(iv) solicits or encourages any customer, vendor or potential customer or vendor of the Company or any Subsidiary with whom the Participant had contact while employed by the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate or otherwise alter his, her or its relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary. The Participant understands that any person or entity that the Participant contacted during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the Participant’s termination of employment for the purpose of soliciting sales from such person or entity shall be regarded as a “potential customer” of the Company to whom the Company or a Subsidiary has a protectable proprietary interest;

* * *

the unvested Restricted Stock shall be forfeited automatically on the date the Participant engages in such activity and the Participant shall pay the Company, within five business days of receipt by the Participant of a written demand therefor, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the number of Shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Stock Agreement which vested within the one-year period described above by the Fair Market Value of a Share, determined as of the date of vesting. 

(c) Remedies for Violation.  
  
(i) Injunctive Action. The Participant acknowledges that if he or she violates the terms of this Section 6 the injury that would be suffered by the Company and/or a Subsidiary as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Stock Agreement (including any provision of Section 6(a) or (b) hereof) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company and/or a Subsidiary for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company and/or a Subsidiary will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Stock Agreement, and the Company and/or a Subsidiary will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Without limiting the Company’s or Subsidiary’s rights under this Section 6 or any other remedies of the Company or a Subsidiary, if the Participant breaches any of the provisions of Section 6(a) or (b) hereof, the Company will have the right to cancel this Stock Agreement.

(ii) Attorneys’ Fees; Set-off Right. In addition to the rights available to the Company and its Subsidiaries under Section 6(c)(i) hereof, if the Participant violates the terms of this Section 6 at any time, the Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Participant of any fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in enforcing the Company’s or a Subsidiary’s rights under this Section 6. By accepting this Restricted Stock grant, the Participant hereby consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company or any Subsidiary owes to the Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to the Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to the Participant by the Company or any Subsidiary), unless such amount is subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent of any amounts that the Participant owes to the Company under this Section 6. In addition to any injunctive relief sought under Section 6(c)(i) hereof and whether or not the Company or any Subsidiary elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company or any Subsidiary does not recover by means of set-off the full amount the Participant owes to the Company or any Subsidiary, calculated as set forth in this Section 6(c)(ii), the Participant agrees to immediately pay the unpaid balance to the Company or any Subsidiary.

(d) Enforceability of Restrictive Covenants. The scope and duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Stock Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate, protectable interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

(e) Written Acknowledgement by Participant. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may require the Participant, as a condition to lapsing any restriction on the Restricted Stock, to acknowledge in writing that the Participant has not engaged, and is not in the process of engaging, in any of the activities described in this Section 6.

Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Committee during the Participant’s lifetime.
