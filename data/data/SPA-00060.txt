A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS MAINTAINED AT THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL CORPORATE OFFICES."

  


3. Transfer Restrictions

(a) Restriction on Transfer. Except for any Permitted Transfer, Holder shall not transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Restricted Shares which are subject to the Repurchase Right.

(b) Transferee Objections. Each Person (other than the Company) to whom the Restricted Shares are transferred by means of a Permitted Transfer must, as a condition precedent to the validity of such transfer, acknowledge in writing to the Company that such Person is bound by the provisions of this Agreement and that the transferred shares are subject to the Repurchase Right.

4. Repurchase Right. 

(a) Grant. The Company is hereby granted the right (the "Repurchase Right"), exercisable at any time during the ninety (90)-day period following the date Holder ceases for any reason to remain in Service, to repurchase at the Per Share Purchase Price all or any portion of the Restricted Shares in which Holder is not, at the time of his or her cessation of Service, vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule (such shares to be hereinafter referred to as the "Unvested Shares").

2

* * *

(b) Exercise of The Repurchase Rights. The Repurchase Right shall be exercisable by written notice delivered to each Owner of the Unvested Shares prior to the expiration of the ninety (90)-day exercise period. The notice shall indicate the number of Unvested Shares to be repurchased and the date on which the repurchase is to be effected, such date to be not more than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. In order to effect any such repurchase, the Company shall pay to Owner, in cash or cash equivalents, an amount equal to the Per Share Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Unvested Shares which are to be repurchased from Owner.

(c) Termination of the Repurchase Right. The Repurchase Right shall terminate with respect to any Unvested Shares for which it is not timely exercised under Paragraph 4(b). In addition, the Repurchase Right shall terminate and cease to be exercisable with respect to any and all Restricted Shares in which Holder vests in accordance with the Vesting Schedule.

(d) Recapitalization. Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including cash) paid as a dividend or otherwise) which is by reason of any Recapitalization distributed with respect to or in exchange for the Restricted Shares shall be immediately subject to the Repurchase Right, but only to the extent the Restricted Shares are at the time covered by such right. Appropriate adjustments to reflect such distribution shall be made to the number and/or class of Restricted Shares subject to this Agreement and to the Per Share Purchase Price to be paid upon the exercise of the Repurchase Right in order to reflect the effect of any such Recapitalization upon the Company's capital structure; provided, however, that the aggregate of the Per Share Purchase Price applicable to all Unvested Shares shall remain the same. Any securities or other property (including cash) distributed with respect to the Restricted Shares as a dividend or otherwise which are subject to the Repurchase Right shall be held in escrow.

(e) Special Tax Election. The grant of the Restricted Shares may result in adverse tax consequences which may be avoided or mitigated by filing an election under Code Section 83(b). Such election must be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement. The form for making the Code Section 83(b) election are set forth in Exhibit B hereto. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ACQUIRING THE RESTRICTED SHARES AND THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FILING THE CODE SECTION 83(B) ELECTION. HOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS HOLDER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY'S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER CODE SECTION 83(B), EVEN IF EMPLOYEE REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.

5. Additional Stock Grants. In addition to the grant of the Restricted Shares, and subject to the terms of the Employment Agreement and this Agreement, the Company shall grant Holder the following shares of Common Stock (together with the Restricted Shares, the "Shares"): 

3

* * *

(a) Up to 80,000 shares over the Employment Period (as defined in the Employment Agreement) based on the Company's earnings before deduction of interest and taxes ("EBIT"), as set forth in the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal year, meeting or exceeding the following targets: 

For 2006 - 2010

  


EBIT growth over prior fiscal year- # of Shares

  


15.0 \- 17.49% 8,000 shares

17.5 \- 19.99% 9,000 shares

20.0 \- 22.49% 10,500 shares

22.5 \- 24.99% 13,000 shares

25.0% \- or more 16,000 shares

  


In the event that the minimum EBIT growth percentage is not met for a particular fiscal year, Holder will have the opportunity to earn back the minimum performance bonus grant for such fiscal year as follows: if the EBIT growth percentage in the subsequent fiscal year combined with the EBIT growth percentage of the prior fiscal year meets or exceeds 30%, then the number of percentage points needed to be added to the prior fiscal year's EBIT growth percentage to equal 15%, shall be deducted from the subsequent fiscal year EBIT growth percentage and added to the prior fiscal year EBIT growth percentage, and Holder shall be granted 8,000 shares of Common Stock for the prior fiscal year, and an additional number of shares of Common Stock determined based on the above formula and the reduced subsequent year EBIT growth percentage. For example, if in 2006, 2007 and 2008 EBIT growth percentage was 14%, 13% and 20%, respectively, then Holder would be deemed (i) not to have met the fiscal year 2006 EBIT growth percentage, (ii) to have met the minimum (15%) EBIT growth percentage (by virtue of deducting 2% percentage points from the fiscal year 2008 EBIT growth percentage and adding those to the 2007 fiscal year EBIT growth percentage), and (iii) to have met the 17.5 - 19.99% EBIT growth percentage for fiscal 2008 (20% - 2% =18%), thereby earning a total 17,000 shares of Common Stock (8,000 shares relating to 2007 and 9,000 shares relating to 2008); and

  


(b) 2,000 shares per year, for a total of up to 10,000 shares of Common Stock over the Employment Period, based on the Company's total revenues, as set forth in the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal year, meeting or exceeding an amount equal to at least 115% of the Company's total revenues for the prior fiscal year.

(c) To the extent that the number of shares of Common Stock earned by Holder pursuant to subparagraphs 5(a) and 5(b) above exceeds a total of 50,000 shares, the grant of such shares shall be subject to obtaining shareholder approval. If such shareholder approval is not obtained prior to the time any such shares are earned by Holder, then Holder shall not be entitled to and shall not be granted any such shares. Any shares to be issued under 5(a) or 5(b) above shall be issued on April 15 of the year following the fiscal year for which the shares were earned.

4

* * *

(d) All shares to be issued pursuant to this Section 5 shall be issued out of the Plan, except that to the extent the shares to be issued under 5(a) and 5(b) above exceed 50,000 shares, such shares shall be issued as a separate individual grant to Employee and not out of the Plan. 

6. Securities Law Compliance

(a) Registration of Securities. The Shares, to the extent issued out of the Plan, have been registered under the Act and are being issued to Holder pursuant to a Form S-8 registration statement.

(ii) Holder shall have complied with all requirements of this Agreement applicable to the disposition of the Restricted Shares.

  


(c) In addition, Holder shall make no disposition of the Shares unless Holder shall have provided the Company with written assurances, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that (a) the proposed disposition does not require registration of the Shares under the 1933 Act or (b) all appropriate action necessary for compliance with the registration requirements of the 1933 Act or any exemption from registration available under the 1933 Act (including Rule 144) has been taken.

(d) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares which have been sold or transferred in violation of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as the owner of the Shares, or otherwise to accord voting, dividend or liquidation rights to, any transferee to whom the Shares have been transferred in contravention of this Agreement.

7. No Right to Employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give the Holder any right to be awarded any additional awards of shares or options under the Plan, or to confer on the Holder any right to continue in the employ of the Company or to be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent will employ the Holder in any particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration, or for any particular period of time or to interfere in any way with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company or of the Holder, other as set forth in the Employment Agreement. 

8. Amounts Not Salary or Bonus. The Holder agrees that the award of the Shares hereunder is special incentive compensation and that it will not be taken into account as "salary" or "compensation" or "bonus" in determining the amount of any payment under any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, savings or stock ownership plan of the Company, its Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, unless expressly provided pursuant to the terms of such plan.
