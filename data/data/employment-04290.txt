termination as of the date specified in such notice or, in the event no such date is specified, on the last day of the month in which such notice is delivered or deemed delivered as provided in Section 9 below. If Executive’s employment under this Agreement is terminated by the Company for cause under this section, Executive shall be entitled to receive only accrued Base Salary and other accrued benefits required by law, prorated to the date of termination. Executive will not be entitled to severance pay, pay in lieu of notice or any other such compensation. Grounds for the Company to terminate this Agreement “for cause” shall be limited to the occurrence of any of the following events:

5.1.1 Executive’s material breach of any provision of this Agreement;

5.1.2 Executive’s engaging or in any manner participating in any activity which is competitive with or intentionally injurious to the Company or which violates any provision of Section 7 of this Agreement;

5.1.3 Executive’s commission of any fraud against the Company or use or appropriation for his personal use or benefit of any funds or properties of the Company;

5.1.4 Executive’s conviction of any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude;

5.1.5 Conduct by Executive which in good faith and reasonable determination of the Board demonstrates gross unfitness to serve.

Any notice of termination given pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall effect termination as of the date specified in such notice or, in the event no such date is specified, on the last day of the month in which such notice is delivered or deemed delivered as provided in Section 9 below.

5.2 The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment at any time without cause upon delivery of written notice to the Executive. Any notice of termination given pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall effect termination as of the date specified in such notice or, in the event no such date is specified, on the last day of the month in which such notice is delivered or deemed delivered as provided in Section 9 below. If such termination shall occur under this Section 5.2, then in lieu of all other remedies, and upon the Executive’s furnishing to the Company an effective waiver and release of claims (in a form acceptable to the Company), Executive shall be entitled to continuation of Base Salary and health benefits for a period of six (6) months from said date of termination with such Base Salary continuation to be at the rate set forth in Section 3.1 or, if greater, at the rate of Executive’s then current salary in effect as of the date of termination.

5.3 The parties may mutually agree at any time to terminate this Agreement upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon in writing.

5.4 This Agreement shall terminate without notice upon the date of Executive’s death or the date when Executive becomes “completely disabled” as that term is defined in Section 6.2.

5.5 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, unless otherwise provided herein or unless otherwise provided by law, Executive may at any time terminate his employment with the Company hereunder. In such event, the Company shall not be liable to Executive for the

payment of any amount other than accrued Base Salary and other accrued benefits required by law, prorated to the date of termination. The effective date of termination of Executive’s employment under this Section 5.5 shall be determined by the Board upon its receipt of notice of such termination. Executive will not be entitled to severance pay, pay in lieu of notice or any other such compensation.

6. DEATH OR DISABILITY DURING TERM OF EMPLOYMENT.

6.1 Upon termination of Executive’s employment pursuant to Section 5.4, Executive or his estate or personal representative, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive Executive’s Base Salary and benefits for a period of one month following the date of death or the date when Executive becomes completely disabled.

6.2 The term “completely disabled” as used in this Agreement shall mean the inability of Executive to perform the essential functions of his position under this Agreement by reason of any incapacity, physical or mental, which the Board of the Company, based upon medical advice or an opinion provided by a licensed physician acceptable to the Board of the Company and approved by the Executive, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, determines to have incapacitated Executive from satisfactorily performing any or all essential functions of his position for the Company during the foreseeable future. Based upon such medical advice or opinion, the determination of the Board of the Company shall be final and binding and the date such determination is made shall be the date of such complete disability for purposes of this Agreement.

7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; NONSOLICITATION.

7.1 Executive recognizes that his employment with the Company will involve contact with information of substantial value to the Company, which is not generally known in the trade, and which gives the Company an advantage over its competitors who do not know or use it, including but not limited to, techniques, designs, drawings, processes, inventions, developments, equipment, prototypes, sales and customer information, and business and financial information relating to the business, products, practices and techniques of the Company (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information”). Executive will at all times regard and preserve as confidential such Confidential Information obtained by Executive from whatever source and will not, either during his employment with the Company or thereafter, publish or disclose any part of such Confidential Information in any manner at any time, or use the same except on behalf of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Company. As a condition of this Agreement, Executive will sign and return a copy of the Company’s “Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement,” attached as Exhibit A.

7.2 While employed by the Company and for one (1) year thereafter, the Executive agrees that in order to protect the Company’s confidential and proprietary information from unauthorized use, that Executive will not, either directly or through others, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor to or for any other person or business entity; or the business of any customer, vendor or distributor of the Company which, at the time of termination or one (1) year immediately prior thereto, was listed on Company’s customer, vendor or distributor list.
