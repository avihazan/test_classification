EXHIBIT A

  


REDEMPTION AGREEMENT

  


THIS REDEMPTION AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the date set forth on the signature page below, between Mericol, Inc. (the “Company”), and Philip Dias (“Holder”).

  


WHEREAS, the Holder has agreed to serve as a consultant and/or an employee of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the employment agreement entered into by and between Holder and Company (“Employment Agreement”);

  


WHEREAS, the Holder received shares of the Company’s common stock, in the amount set forth on the signature page below (the “Company Shares”), pursuant to the Employment Agreement;

  


WHEREAS, as consideration for receiving the Company Shares initially, the Holder hereby gives the Company the right to redeem a portion of the Company Shares based upon the following criteria as set forth in Section 2 of this Redemption Agreement;

  


NOW, THEREFORE, for consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


1\. The Holder agrees not to sell, pledge, hypothecate, transfer, assign or in any other manner dispose of any of the Company Shares on the terms and conditions set forth therein.

  


2\. The Holder agrees that if he ceases to be an Employee for any or no reason at any time during the 12 month period from the date hereof, the Company has the right to purchase an amount of shares equal to the multiple of the (i) number of Shares times (ii) the following fraction, the numerator being (a) 365 less the number of days elapsed between the date hereof and the date the Holder ceased to serve as an employee of Company and the denominator being (b) 365. The redemption price shall be the multiple of $.0001 times the amount of Shares to be purchased.

3\. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any other agreements between the parties, the Holder shall be entitled to his beneficial rights of ownership of the Company Shares, including the right to vote the Company Shares for any and all purposes.

  


4\. If the Holder fails to fully adhere to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, he shall be liable to every other party for any damages suffered by any party by reason of any such breach of the terms and conditions hereof. The Holder agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that in addition to all other remedies that may be available in law or in equity to the non-defaulting party, a preliminary and permanent injunction and an order of a court requiring such defaulting Holder to cease and desist from violating the terms and conditions of this Agreement and specifically requiring such Holder to perform his obligations hereunder is fair and reasonable by reason of the inability of the parties to this Agreement to presently determine the type, extent or amount of damages that the Company or the non-defaulting Holder may suffer as a result of any breach or continuation thereof. In the event of default hereunder, the non-defaulting parties shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees incurred in the enforcement of this Agreement.

  


* * *

5\. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended unless both parties agree in writing.

  


6\. The provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators of the parties hereto.

  


7\. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts entered into and to be performed wholly within said State; and the Company and the Holder agree that any action based upon this Agreement may be brought in the United States and state courts of Harris County, Texas only, and each submits himself/itself to the jurisdiction of such courts for all purposes hereunder.

  


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have duly executed and delivered this Agreement as of July 27, 2012.
