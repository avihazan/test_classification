The certificate or certificates for the Shares as to which the Option shall have been so exercised shall be registered in the name of the person or persons so exercising the Option (or, if the Option shall be exercised by the Participant and if the Participant shall so request in the notice exercising the Option, shall be registered in the name of the Participant and another person jointly, with right of survivorship) and shall be delivered as

All Shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and nonassessable. 

6\. PARTIAL EXERCISE. 

Exercise of this Option to the extent above stated may be made in part at any time and from time to time within the above limits, except that no fractional share shall be issued pursuant to this Option. 

7\. NON-ASSIGNABILITY. 

The Option shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules thereunder. Except as provided in the previous sentence, the Option shall be exercisable, during the Participant’s lifetime, only by the Participant (or, in the event of legal incapacity or incompetency, by the Participant’s guardian or representative) and shall not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Option or of any rights granted hereunder contrary to the provisions of this Section 7, or the levy of any attachment or similar process upon the Option shall be null and void. 

8\. NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER UNTIL EXERCISE. 

The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to this Agreement until registration of the Shares in the Company’s share register in the name of the Participant. Except as is expressly provided in the Plan with respect to certain changes in the capitalization of the Company, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or similar rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such registration. 

9\. CAPITAL CHANGES AND BUSINESS SUCCESSIONS. 

The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of Options in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to stock subject to Options and the related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Company are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that in the event of a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in Section 3 hereof) all of the Shares which would have vested in each vesting installment remaining under this Option will be vested for purposes of Section 23(B) of the Plan.

* * *

10\. TAXES. 

The Participant acknowledges that upon exercise of the Option the Participant will be deemed to have taxable income measured by the difference between the then fair market value of the Shares received upon exercise and the price paid for such Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The Participant acknowledges that any income or other taxes due from him or her with respect to this Option or the Shares issuable pursuant to this Option shall be the Participant’s responsibility. 

The Participant agrees that the Company may withhold from the Participant’s remuneration, if any, the minimum statutory amount of federal, state and local withholding taxes attributable to such amount that is considered compensation includable in such person’s gross income. At the Company’s discretion, the amount required to be withheld may be withheld in cash from such remuneration, or in kind from the Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant on exercise of the Option. The Participant further agrees that, if the Company does not withhold an amount from the Participant’s remuneration sufficient to satisfy the Company’s income tax withholding obligation, the Participant will reimburse the Company on demand, in cash, for the amount under-withheld. 

11\. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT. 

Unless the offering and sale of the Shares to be issued upon the particular exercise of the Option shall have been effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as now in force or hereafter amended (the “1933 Act”), the Company shall be under no obligation to issue the Shares covered by such exercise unless and until the following conditions have been fulfilled: 

(a) The person(s) who exercise the Option shall warrant to the Company, at the time of such exercise, that such person(s) are acquiring such Shares for their own respective accounts, for investment, and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any such Shares, in which event the person(s) acquiring such Shares shall be bound by the provisions of the following legend which shall be endorsed upon the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to such exercise:   
  
“The shares represented by this certificate have been taken for investment and they may not be sold or otherwise transferred by any person, including a pledgee, unless (1) either (a) a Registration Statement with respect to such shares shall be effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it that an exemption from registration under such Act is then available, and (2) there shall have been compliance with all applicable state securities laws;” and 

(b)

If the Company so requires, the Company shall have received an opinion of its counsel that the Shares may be issued upon such particular exercise in compliance with the 1933 Act without registration thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may delay issuance of the Shares until completion   
  
5 

* * *

of any action or obtaining of any consent, which the Company deems necessary under any applicable law (including without limitation state securities or “blue sky” laws).   
  
12\. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF SHARES. 

12.1 The Shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option granted hereby shall not be transferred by the Participant except as permitted herein. 

12.2 In the event of the Participant’s termination of service for any reason, the Company shall have the option, but not the obligation, to repurchase all or any part of the Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, Shares purchased after termination of employment, Disability or death in accordance with Section 4 hereof). In the event the Company does not, upon the termination of service of the Participant (as described above), exercise its option pursuant to this Section 12.2, the restrictions set forth in the balance of this Agreement shall not thereby lapse, and the Participant for himself or herself, his or her heirs, legatees, executors, administrators and other successors in interest, agrees that the Shares shall remain subject to such restrictions. The following provisions shall apply to a repurchase under this Section 12.2: 

(i) The per share repurchase price of the Shares to be sold to the Company upon exercise of its option under this Section 12.2 shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of each such Share determined in accordance with the Plan as of the date of termination of service.   
  
(ii) The Company’s option to repurchase the Participant’s Shares in the event of termination of service shall be valid for a period of eighteen (18) months commencing with the date of such termination of service.   
  
(iii) In the event the Company shall be entitled to and shall elect to exercise its option to repurchase the Participant’s Shares under this Section 12.2, the Company shall notify the Participant, or in case of death, his or her representative, in writing of its intent to repurchase the Shares. Such written notice may be mailed by the Company up to and including the last day of the time period provided for in Section 12.2(ii) for exercise of the Company’s option to repurchase.   
  
(iv) The written notice to the Participant shall specify the address at, and the time and date on, which payment of the repurchase price is to be made (the “Closing”). The date specified shall not be less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of the mailing of the notice, and the Participant or his or her successor in interest with respect to the Shares shall have no further rights as the owner thereof from and after the date specified in the notice. At the Closing, the repurchase price shall be delivered to the Participant or his or her successor in interest and the Shares being purchased, duly endorsed for transfer, shall, to the extent that they are not then in the possession of the Company, be delivered to the Company by the Participant or his or her successor in interest.

* * *

12.3 It shall be a condition precedent to the validity of any sale or other transfer of any Shares by the Participant that the following restrictions be complied with (except as hereinafter otherwise provided): 

(i) No Shares owned by the Participant may be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred (including by gift or devise) to any person or entity, voluntarily, or by operation of law, except in accordance with the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.   
  
(ii) Before selling or otherwise transferring all or part of the Shares, the Participant shall give written notice of such intention to the Company, which notice shall include the name of the proposed transferee, the proposed purchase price per share, the terms of payment of such purchase price and all other matters relating to such sale or transfer and shall be accompanied by a copy of the binding written agreement of the proposed transferee to purchase the Shares of the Participant. Such notice shall constitute a binding offer by the Participant to sell to the Company such number of the Shares then held by the Participant as are proposed to be sold in the notice at the monetary price per share designated in such notice, payable on the terms offered to the Participant by the proposed transferee (provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to meet any non-monetary terms of the proposed transfer, including, without limitation, delivery of other securities in exchange for the Shares proposed to be sold). The Company shall give written notice to the Participant as to whether such offer has been accepted in whole by the Company within sixty (60) days after its receipt of written notice from the Participant. The Company may only accept such offer in whole and may not accept such offer in part. Such acceptance notice shall fix a time, location and date for the closing on such purchase (“Closing Date”) which shall not be less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of the acceptance notice. The place for such closing shall be at the Company’s principal office. At such closing, the Participant shall accept payment as set forth herein and shall deliver to the Company in exchange therefor certificates for the number of Shares stated in the notice accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer.   
  
(iii) If the Company shall fail to accept any such offer, the Participant shall be free to sell all, but not less than all, of the Shares set forth in his or her notice to the designated transferee at the price and terms designated in the Participant’s notice, provided that (i) such sale is consummated within six (6) months after the giving of notice by the Participant to the Company as aforesaid, and (ii) the transferee first agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12 so that such transferee (and all subsequent transferees) shall thereafter only be permitted to sell or transfer the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof. After the expiration of such six (6) months, the provisions of this Section 12.3 shall again apply with respect to any proposed voluntary transfer of the Participant’s Shares.

* * *

(iv) The restrictions on transfer contained in this Section 12.3 shall not apply to (a) transfers by the Participant to his or her spouse or children or to a trust for the benefit of his or her spouse or children, (b) transfers by the Participant to his or her guardian or conservator, and (c) or transfers by the Participant, in the event of his or her death, to his or her executor(s) or administrator(s) or to trustee(s) under his or her will (collectively, “Permitted Transferees”); provided however, that in any such event the Shares so transferred in the hands of each such Permitted Transferee shall remain subject to this Agreement, and each such Permitted Transferee shall so acknowledge in writing as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such transfer.   
  
(v) The provisions of this Section 12.3 may be waived by the Company. Any such waiver may be unconditional or based upon such conditions as the Company may impose.   
  
12.4 In the event that the Participant or his or her successor in interest fails to deliver the Shares to be repurchased by the Company under this Agreement, the Company may elect (a) to establish a segregated account in the amount of the repurchase price, such account to be turned over to the Participant or his or her successor in interest upon delivery of such Shares, and (b) immediately to take such action as is appropriate to transfer record title of such Shares from the Participant to the Company and to treat the Participant and such Shares in all respects as if delivery of such Shares had been made as required by this Agreement. The Participant hereby irrevocably grants the Company a power of attorney which shall be coupled with an interest for the purpose of effectuating the preceding sentence. 

12.5 If the Company shall pay a stock dividend or declare a stock split on or with respect to any of its Common Stock, or otherwise distribute securities of the Company to the holders of its Common Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities of Company issued with respect to the shares then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be added to the Shares subject to the Company’s rights to repurchase pursuant to this Agreement. If the Company shall distribute to its stockholders shares of stock of another corporation, the shares of stock of such other corporation, distributed with respect to the Shares then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Shares subject to the Company’s rights to repurchase pursuant to this Agreement. 

12.6 If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares or combined into a smaller number of shares, or in the event of a reclassification of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, or if the Company shall be a party to a merger, consolidation or capital reorganization, there shall be substituted for the Shares then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement such amount and kind of securities as are issued in such subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger, consolidation or capital reorganization in respect of the Shares subject immediately prior thereto to the Company’s rights to repurchase pursuant to this Agreement. 

12.7 The Company shall not be required to transfer any Shares on its books which shall have been sold, assigned or otherwise transferred in violation of this Agreement, or to treat as 

8 

* * *

owner of such Shares, or to accord the right to vote as such owner or to pay dividends to, any person or organization to which any such Shares shall have been so sold, assigned or otherwise transferred, in violation of this Agreement. 

12.8 The provisions of Sections 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3 shall terminate upon the consummation of a public offering of any of the Company’s securities pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, in which offering the aggregate gross proceeds to the Company exceed $15,000,000 and in which the price per share of such securities equals or exceeds $5.00 (such price subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, combination, reorganization, reclassification or other similar event). 

12.9 If, in connection with a registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Act, the Company or its underwriter so requests, the Participant will agree not to sell any Shares for a period not to exceed 180 days following the effectiveness of such registration. 

12.10 The Participant acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company, its shareholders nor its directors and officers, has any duty or obligation to disclose to the Participant any material information regarding the business of the Company or affecting the value of the Shares before, at the time of, or following a termination of the employment of the Participant by the Company, including, without limitation, any information concerning plans for the Company to make a public offering of its securities or to be acquired by or merged with or into another firm or entity.

Exhibit A

NOTICE OF EXERCISE OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION 

[Form For Unregistered Shares]   
  
To:

454 Life Sciences Corporation  
  
322 East Main Street  
  
Branford, CT 06405  
  
ATTN: Chief Financial Officer  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I hereby exercise my Non-Qualified Stock Option to purchase  shares (the “Shares”) of the common stock, $.01 par value, of 454 Life Sciences Corporation(the “Company”), at the exercise price of $ per share, pursuant to and subject to the terms of that certain Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement between the undersigned and the Company dated April 2, 2001. 

I am aware that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or any state securities laws. I understand that the reliance by the Company on exemptions under the 1933 Act is predicated in part upon the truth and accuracy of the statements by me in this Notice of Exercise. 

I hereby represent and warrant that (1) I have been furnished with all information which I deem necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of the purchase of the Shares; (2) I have had the opportunity to ask questions concerning the Shares and the Company and all questions posed have been answered to my satisfaction; (3) I have been given the opportunity to obtain any additional information I deem necessary to verify the accuracy of any information obtained concerning the Shares and the Company; and (4) I have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that I am able to evaluate the merits and risks of purchasing the Shares and to make an informed investment decision relating thereto. 

I hereby represent and warrant that I am purchasing the Shares for my own personal account for investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution of all or any part of the Shares. 

I understand that because the Shares have not been registered under the 1933 Act, I must continue to bear the economic risk of the investment for an indefinite time and the Shares cannot be sold unless the Shares are subsequently registered under applicable federal and state securities laws or an exemption from such registration requirements is available. 

I agree that I will in no event sell or distribute or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Shares unless (1) there is an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction involving the Shares or (2) the Company receives an opinion of my legal counsel (concurred in by legal counsel for the Company) stating that such transaction is exempt from registration or the Company otherwise satisfies itself that such transaction is exempt from registration. 

12 

* * *

I consent to the placing of a legend on my certificate for the Shares stating that the Shares have not been registered and setting forth the restriction on transfer contemplated hereby and to the placing of a stop transfer order on the books of the Company and with any transfer agents against the Shares until the Shares may be legally resold or distributed without restriction. 

I understand that at the present time Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) may not be relied on for the resale or distribution of the Shares by me. I understand that the Company has no obligation to me to register the sale of the Shares with the SEC and has not represented to me that it will register the sale of the Shares. 

I understand the terms and restrictions on the right to dispose of the Shares set forth in the 2000 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan and the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, both of which I have carefully reviewed. I consent to the placing of a legend on my certificate for the Shares referring to such restriction and the placing of stop transfer orders until the Shares may be transferred in accordance with the terms of such restrictions. 

I have considered the Federal, state and local income tax implications of the exercise of my Option and the purchase and subsequent sale of the Shares. 

I am paying the option exercise price for the Shares as follows:

Please issue the stock certificate for the Shares (check one):
