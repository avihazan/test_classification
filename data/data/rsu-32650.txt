* * *

(i) information relating to the Company’s past and existing customers and vendors and development of prospective customers and vendors, including specific customer product requirements, pricing arrangements, payments terms, customer lists and other similar information;   
  
(ii) inventions, designs, methods, discoveries, works of authorship, creations, improvements or ideas developed or otherwise produced, acquired or used by the Company;

The Company devotes significant financial, human and other resources to the development of its products, its customer base and the general goodwill associated with its business, and the Company diligently maintains the secrecy and confidentiality of its Confidential Information.

(c) Remedies for Violation.  
  
(i) Injunctive Action. Participant acknowledges that if he or she violates the terms of this Section 6, the injury that would be suffered by the Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Option Agreement (including any provision of Section 6 (a) or (b) hereof) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Option Agreement, and the Company will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Without limiting the Company’s rights under this Section 6(c) (or Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof) or any other remedies of the Company, if the Participant breaches any of the provisions of Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof, the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to the Participant under this Option Agreement.   
  
(ii) Forfeiture of the Option and Repayment. In addition to the rights available to the Company under Section 6(c)(i) hereof, if Participant violates the terms of this Section 6 at any time, Participant, without any further action by the Company or Participant, shall forfeit, as of the first day of any such violation, all right, title and interest to this Option, any Option Shares then owned by Participant and any net proceeds received by Participant pursuant to any sales or transfer of any Option Shares prior to, on or after such date, and the Company shall have the right to issue a stop transfer order and other appropriate instructions to its transfer agent with respect to this Option and the Option Shares, and the Company further shall be entitled to reimbursement from Participant of any fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the Company’s rights under this Section 6. By accepting this Option grant, Participant hereby consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes to Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by the Company), to the extent of any amounts that Participant owes the Company under this Section 6. In addition to any injunctive relief sought under Section 6(c)(i) hereof and whether or not the Company elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount Participant owes to the Company, calculated as set forth in this Section 6(c)(ii), Participant agrees to immediately pay the unpaid balance to the Company.   
  
(d) Enforceability of Restrictive Covenants. The scope and duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Option Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate, protectible interest of the Company. However, if one or more provisions of this Option Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law to any extent, such provision(s) shall, to that extent, be excluded from this Option Agreement and the balance of the Option Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision(s) were so excluded to that extent and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.   
  
(e) Written Acknowledgement by Participant. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may require the Participant, as a condition to the exercise of this Option, to acknowledge in writing that he or she has not engaged, and is not in the process of engaging, in any of the activities described in this Section 6.
