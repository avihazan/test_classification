3. Payment. Your Award shall be settled by the delivery of shares of Company common stock.

4. Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents shall be credited in respect of Company common stock share equivalents covered by your Award.

Any additional share equivalents covered by your Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement to which they relate.

5. Securities Law Compliance. You may not be issued any shares under your Award unless the shares are either (i) then registered under the Securities Act or (ii) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

If the limitations and requirements of Code Section 409A are violated, deferred amounts will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates immediately upon such violation and will be subject to penalties equal to (i) 20% of the amount deferred and (ii) interest at a specified rate on the under-payment of tax that would have occurred had the deferred compensation been included in gross income in the taxable year in which it was first deferred.

9. Notices. Any notices provided for in your Award or the Plan shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the Company.
