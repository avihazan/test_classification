The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Quanex Building Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to the Quanex Building Products Corporation 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), hereby awards to you, the above-named Grantee, effective as of the Date of Award set forth above, that number of Performance Units set forth above (each, a “Performance Unit”, and collectively, the “Performance Units”), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Performance Unit Award Agreement (this “Agreement”).  
  
[The][Each] Performance [Units provide][Unit provides] you an opportunity to [receive shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”),][earn a cash payment] based upon attainment of the Performance Goals during the Performance Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Performance Period” means the _______

2.

FINAL PERFORMANCE FACTOR. The aggregate [number of shares of the Common Stock to be issued to you][amount payable] under this Agreement [(the “Shares”)] is equal to the number of Performance Units multiplied by the Target Value of each Performance Unit multiplied by the Final Performance Factor (which is determined as provided below)[divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share of Common Stock on the first business day immediately preceding the Payment Date]:  
  
2.1 The Final Performance Factor shall be equal to one (1) if (a) the Company achieves the Target Milestone during the Performance Period and does not achieve the Maximum Milestone during the Performance Period, (b) “a Change in Control of the Company has not occurred on or before the last day of the Performance Period, and (c) you remain in the active employ of one or more members of the Company Group through the last day of the Performance Period.

2.3 The Final Performance Factor shall be equal to three-fourths (3/4) if (a) the Company achieves the Threshold Milestone during the Performance Period and does not achieve the Target Milestone during the Performance Period, (b) a Change in Control of the Company has not occurred on or before the last day of the Performance Period, and (c) you remain in the active employ of one or more members of the Company Group through the last day of the Performance Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Threshold Milestone” means  . 

2.4 If the performance standard achieved with respect to a particular Performance Goal is between the Threshold Milestone and the Target Milestone or between the Target Milestone and the Maximum Milestone, the applicable Final Performance Factor shall be determined by interpolation. 

For example, assume that the Committee grants an executive a performance based compensation award under the Plan that is contingent upon achieving Performance Goal A and Performance Goal B, weighting the importance of the goals as 50% and 50%, respectively. The Committee establishes Threshold, Target and Maximum Milestones for each Goal. The Final Performance Factor assigned for achieving the threshold, target and maximum performance standards are 3/4, 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, assume that the executive is awarded 2,000 Performance Units with a Target Value of $100, is continuously employed by the Company throughout the Performance Period and achieves the Maximum Milestone for Performance Goal A, and precisely halfway between the Target and Maximum Milestones for Performance Goal B. The total amount payable to the executive under the award is $250,000, which is determined as follows: .The amount payable to the executive with respect to Performance Goal A is $100,000 (50% (Performance Goal Percentage) x 2,000 (Performance Units) x $100 (Performance Unit Value) x 1 (Final Performance Factor) = $100,000), and the amount payable to the executive with respect to Performance Goal B is $150,000 (50% (Performance Goal Percentage) x 2000 (Performance Units) x $100 (Target Value) x 1.5 (Final Performance Factor)= $150,000). 

2.5 If the Threshold Milestone is not achieved during the Performance Period and a Change in Control of the Company has not occurred on or before the last day of the Performance Period, then the award pursuant to this Agreement shall lapse and be forfeited as of the last day of the Performance Period. 

2.6 The Committee’s determinations with respect to the Performance Period for purposes of this Agreement shall be binding upon all persons. The Committee may not increase the amount payable under this Agreement. 

3.

[The Company, on behalf of the Employer, shall cause the Shares to be issued][Any amount payable to you pursuant to this Agreement will be paid] to you [by the Employer] as soon as administratively practicable following the date of the Committee’s certification that the Performance Goals have been satisfied, but no later than 21/2 months following the end of the calendar year in which the Ending Date occurs [the “Payment Date”], unless otherwise provided under this Agreement. [The Shares that may be issued to you under this Agreement][Such payment] will be [issued][made] to you in exchange for the Performance Units and thereafter you shall have no further rights with respect to such Performance Units or the Agreement.
