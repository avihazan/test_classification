II. AGREEMENT

1\. Grant of Option. The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to the Optionee named in the Notice of Stock Option Grant (the “Optionee”), an option (the “Option”) to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Stock Option Grant, at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Stock Option Grant (the “Exercise Price”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 10(e) of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail. This Option shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option, which does not qualify as an “incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code. 

2\. Exercise of Option.

(a) Right to Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Stock Option Grant and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. 

(b) Method of Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice in the form attached as Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”) which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company. 

No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such issuance and such exercise comply with Applicable Laws. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to such Shares. 

The Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with this Option Agreement) from the Optionee (or other person entitled to exercise the Option), and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, and (iii) any other documents required by this Option Agreement or the Exercise Notice. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment permitted by this Option Agreement. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 10(c) of the Plan. 

Exercise of this Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

##### 

(c) Vesting Acceleration. If, within the period of time beginning two (2) months prior and ending twelve (12) months after the consummation of a Change in Control transaction, Optionee’s employment with the Company terminates either as a result of (i) an involuntary termination by the Company other than for Cause (as defined in the Plan) or (ii) a voluntary termination by Optionee for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), then this Option shall become vested and exercisable as to one hundred percent (100%) of the unexercised outstanding Shares subject to the Option. 

3\. Term. Optionee may not exercise the Option before the commencement of its term or after its term expires. During the term of the Option, Optionee may only exercise the Option to the extent vested. The term of the Option commences on the Date of Grant and expires upon the earliest of the following: 

(a) With respect to the unvested portion of the Option, upon termination of Optionee’s Continuous Service; 

(b) With respect to the vested portion of the Option, sixty (60) days after the termination of Optionee’s Continuous Service for any reason other than Optionee’s Disability, death or termination for Cause; 

(c) With respect to the vested portion of the Option, immediately upon the termination of Optionee’s Continuous Service for Cause; 

(d) With respect to the vested portion of the Option, twelve (12) months after the termination of Optionee’s Continuous Service due to Optionee’s Disability or death; 

(e) Immediately prior to the close of certain Corporate Transactions, pursuant to Section 9(b) of the Plan; and 

(f) The day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. 

4\. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee: 

(a) cash or check; 

(b) in the discretion of the Company, determined at the time of exercise, consideration received by the Company under a formal broker-assisted stock option exercise program adopted by the Company in connection with the Plan, if any; 

(c) in the discretion of the Company, determined at the time of exercise, surrender of other Shares which, (i) in the case of Shares acquired from the Company, either directly or indirectly, have been owned by the Optionee for such length of time on the date of surrender as required under the financial accounting rules to a void a compensation expense, and (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares; or 

(d) any combination of the foregoing methods.

5\. Optionee’s Representations. In the event the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), at the time this Option is exercised, the Optionee shall, if required by the Company, concurrently with the exercise of all or any portion of this Option, deliver to the Company an investment representation statement in a form satisfactory to the Company. 

6\. Lock-Up Period. Optionee hereby agrees that Optionee shall not offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company or enter into any swap, hedging or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company held by Optionee (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company not to exceed ninety (90) days following the effective date of any registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act. 

Optionee agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the underwriter which are consistent with the foregoing or which are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or the representative of the underwriters of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, Optionee shall provide, within ten (10) days of such request, such information as may be required by the Company or such representative in connection with the completion of any public offering of the Company’s securities pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. The obligations described in this Section shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a Commission Rule 145 transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred eighty (180) day period. Optionee agrees that any transferee of the Option or shares acquired pursuant to the Option shall be bound by this Section. 

7\. Restrictions on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised until such time as the Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company, or if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would constitute a violation of any Applicable Law. 

8\. Non-Transferability of Option. Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Plan Administrator in writing, this Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.

9\. Withholding Tax Obligations.

Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are not delivered at the time of exercise. 

10\. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Optionee’s interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and Optionee.
