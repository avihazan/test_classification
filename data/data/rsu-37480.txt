Re: Incentive Stock Option

Notice is hereby given pursuant to Section 3 of my Agreement that I elect to purchase the number of shares set forth below at the exercise price set forth in my Agreement:

Stock Option dated: _____________________  
Number of shares being purchased: _____________________  
Option Exercise Price Per Share _____________________  
Aggregate Option Exercise Price _____________________  
  
A check in the amount of the aggregate price of the shares being purchased is attached.

I understand that the shares of Common Stock that I receive upon exercise of my Option may not be freely tradable.

Further, I understand that, as a result of this exercise of rights, I will recognize income in an amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock exceeds the exercise price. I agree to report such income in accordance with then applicable law and to cooperate with the Company in establishing the withholding and corresponding deduction to the Company for its income tax purposes.

I agree to provide to the Company such additional documents or information as may be required pursuant to the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.
