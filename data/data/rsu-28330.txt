7\. Limits on Transferability. During the period of time that any shares of Restricted Stock are unvested, such unvested shares shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or to a beneficiary upon the death of the Participant, or as otherwise specifically permitted by the Committee.

(b) for the period during which any obligation arising from financial assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (“TARP”) remains outstanding (disregarding any warrants to purchase common stock of the Company that the U.S. Treasury may hold, the “TARP Period”), the Participant shall forfeit the Restricted Stock granted hereunder if the Participant does not continue performing substantial services for the Company for at least two years from the date of grant, other than due to the Participant’s death or disability, or a change in control event (as defined Treas.

(c) the Restricted Stock granted hereunder may not become transferable (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.83–3(d)) at any time earlier than permitted under the following schedule (except as necessary to reflect a merger or acquisition of the Company or as may reasonably be required to pay federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that result from the vesting of the Restricted Stock, which transferred shares shall not be counted toward the percentages in the following schedule):

iv.

The remainder of the Restricted Stock granted at the time of repayment by the Company of 100% of the aggregate financial assistance received from the U.S. Treasury under TARP.  
  
15\. Compliance with Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Participant acknowledges that if Participant and any award governed by this Agreement are subject to Section 111 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended, and any regulations, determinations, or interpretations that may from time to time be promulgated thereunder (“EESA”), then any payment of any kind provided for by this Agreement must comply with EESA, and that this Agreement shall be interpreted or reformed to so comply. If the making of any payment pursuant to this Agreement would violate EESA, or if the making of such payment may in the judgment of the Company limit or adversely impact the ability of the Company to participate in the TA RP or to qualify for any other relief under EESA, Participant shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to such payment. In addition, if applicable, the shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder will be subject to forfeiture or repayment if the granting or payment of such shares is based on financial statements or performance metrics that are later determined to be materially inaccurate. If applicable, Participant also hereby grants to the U.S. Treasury (or other body of the U.S. government) and to the Company a waiver releasing the U.S. Treasury (or other body) and the Company from any claims that Participant may otherwise have as a result of the issuance of any regulations, determinations, or interpretations that adversely modify the terms of this Agreement or any benefits plans, arrangements, and agreements to eliminate any provisions that would not be in compliance with the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of Section 111 of EESA and any regulatio ns, determinations, or interpretations that may from time to time be promulgated thereunder, or any securities purchase agreement or other agreement entered into between the Company and the U.S. Treasury (or other body) pursuant to EESA.
