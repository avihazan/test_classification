STRAYER EDUCATION, INC.  
2011 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN  
RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

  


Restricted Stock/  
Nontransferability

This grant is an award of Stock in the number of shares set forth on the cover sheet subject to the vesting conditions set forth in the cover sheet and described below ("Restricted Stock"). To the extent not yet vested, your Restricted Stock may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor may the Restricted Stock be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process.   
  
Issuance and Vesting

The Corporation will issue your Restricted Stock in your name as of the Grant Date. 

Your right to the Stock under this Restricted Stock Agreement vests in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the cover sheet. 

Notwithstanding the vesting schedule in the preceding paragraph, the shares of Restricted Stock shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Corporation or upon your death or Disability. 

No additional shares of Restricted Stock will vest after your Service has terminated for any reason other than death or Disability.   
  
Evidence of Issuance The issuance of the Stock under the grant of Restricted Stock evidenced by this Agreement shall be evidenced in such a manner as the Corporation, in its discretion, deems appropriate, including, without limitation, book-entry, direct registration or issuance of one or more share certificates (which may be held in escrow at the option of the Corporation until vested), with any unvested shares of Restricted Stock bearing the appropriate restrictions imposed by this Agreement. As your interest in the Restricted Stock vests, the recordation of the number of shares of Restricted Stock attributable to you will be appropriately modified if necessary.   
Death or Disability If your Service terminates because of your death, then your shares of Restricted Stock will immediately become fully vested. If your Service terminates because of your Disability, then your shares of Restricted Stock will immediately become fully vested.

* * *

Escrow

If the Restricted Stock is certificated, the certificates for the Restricted Stock shall be deposited in escrow with the Secretary of the Corporation to be held in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. Each deposited certificate shall be accompanied by a duly executed Assignment Separate from Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. The deposited certificates shall remain in escrow until such time or times as the certificates are to be released or otherwise surrendered for cancellation as discussed below. Upon delivery of the certificates to the Corporation, you shall be issued an instrument of deposit acknowledging the number of shares of Stock delivered in escrow to the Secretary of the Corporation. 

All regular cash dividends on the Stock (or other securities at the time held in escrow) shall be paid directly to you and shall not be held in escrow. However, in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or other change affecting the Corporation's outstanding common stock as a class effected without receipt of consideration or in the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in the Corporation Stock, any new, substituted or additional securities or other property which is by reason of such transaction distributed with respect to the Stock shall be immediately delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation to be held in escrow hereunder, but only to the extent the Stock is at the time subject to the escrow requirements hereof. 

The shares of Stock held in escrow hereunder shall be subject to the following terms and conditions relating to their release from escrow or their surrender to the Corporation for cancellation: 

If your interest in the shares vests as described above, the certificates for such vested shares shall be released from escrow and delivered to you, at your request, in accordance with the following schedule: 

● The release of any vested shares (or other vested assets and securities) from escrow shall be effected within thirty (30) days following the date on which such shares first become vested.   
  
Withholding Taxes You agree, as a condition of this grant, that you will make acceptable arrangements to pay any withholding or other taxes that may be due as a result of the payment of dividends or the vesting of Stock acquired under this grant.

Section 83(b) 

Election

Under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the difference between the purchase price (if any) paid for the shares of Stock and their fair market value on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such shares lapse will be reportable as ordinary income at that time. For this purpose, "forfeiture restrictions" include the forfeiture as to unvested Stock described above. You may elect to be taxed at the time the shares are acquired, rather than when such shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date. You will have to make a tax payment to the extent the purchase price is less than the fair market value of the shares on the Grant Date. No tax payment will have to be made to the extent the purchase price is at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the Grant Date. The form for making this election is attached as Exhibit B hereto. Failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by you (in the event the fair market value of the shares as of the vesting date exceeds the purchase price) as the forfeiture restrictions lapse. 

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE CORPORATION'S, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO MAKE A FILING, AND IF YOU DETERMINE TO MAKE SUCH A FILING, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF YOU REQUEST THE CORPORATION OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON YOUR BEHALF. YOU ARE RELYING SOLELY ON YOUR OWN ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE ANY 83(b) ELECTION.

Non-Competition

To the extent permitted by law and applicable professional regulations, during the period you are providing Services to the Corporation and for a period of one year thereafter, you shall not take actions in competition with the Corporation in any state or similar jurisdiction in which the Corporation conducts a material amount of its business. Unless otherwise specified in an employment or other agreement between the Corporation and you, you take actions in competition with the Corporation if you: 

  * Fail to keep strictly confidential all confidential business information disclosed by the Corporation to you, or which is obtained by you or otherwise disclosed to you in connection with performing Services for the Corporation, or use any such confidential information for any purpose other than performing Services for the Corporation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to information which (1) at the time of disclosure to you is already a matter of public knowledge, (2) after disclosure to you becomes a matter of public knowledge, except by your breach of this provision , (3) was already in your possession at the time of disclosure and does not solely constitute specific and detailed information regarding the Corporation (it being acknowledged that you possessed extensive industry experience and general knowledge of the education sector prior to joining the Corporation); or (4) which is required to be disclosed by law or regulation; 


  * Enter into any employment, consulting or similar relationships with third parties which will result in a direct and material conflict of interest with the Corporation’s business; 


  * Act in any managerial capacity for or acquire an ownership interest in (except a minority interest of 5% or less acquired for investment purposes in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange) any person or entity that is a direct and material competitor of the Corporation; 


  * Without the written consent of the Corporation, solicit or direct anyone else to solicit any officer or key employee of the Corporation (y) to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with the Corporation or (z) to seek or accept employment with you or any third party; provided that the foregoing shall exclude actions which are the result of persons responding to general advertisements and do not involve any solicitation on your part. 



You acknowledge and agree that any material breach by you of any of the provisions of this Section (the “Restrictive Covenants”) would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages would not provide an adequate remedy. Therefore, if you materially breach, or threaten to materially breach, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Corporation and its affiliates shall have the right to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced (without posting bond and without the need to prove damages) by any court having equity jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the right to an entry against you of restraining orders and injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against violations, threatened or actual, and whether or not then continuing, of such covenants. This right and remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Corporation and its affiliates under law or in equity (including, without limitation, the recovery of damages). In addition, in the event of such a material breach of the Restrictive Covenants the Corporation shall have the right to cause a forfeiture of your Restricted Stock Agreement and the value of any shares of Restricted Stock that vested in the twelve (12) months prior to your material breach.

Clawback This Award is subject to mandatory repayment by you to the Corporation to the extent you are or in the future become subject to any Corporation “clawback” or recoupment policy that requires the repayment by you to the Corporation of compensation paid by the Corporation to you in the event that you fail to comply with, or violate, the terms or requirements of such policy.   
Shareholder Rights You have the right to vote the Restricted Stock and to receive any cash dividends declared or paid on such stock unless and until forfeited. Any stock distributions you receive as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares or other similar transaction shall be deemed to be a part of the Restricted Stock and subject to the same conditions and restrictions applicable thereto. Except as described in the Plan, no adjustments are made for dividends or other rights if the applicable record date occurs before your stock certificate is issued.   
Adjustments In the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in the Corporation stock, the number of shares covered by this grant may be adjusted (and rounded down to the nearest whole number) pursuant to the Plan. Your Restricted Stock shall be subject to the terms of the agreement of merger, liquidation or reorganization in the event the Corporation is subject to such corporate activity.
