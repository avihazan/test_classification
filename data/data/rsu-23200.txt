shall be appropriately adjusted, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Employee’s rights with respect to such Options and Shares or to reflect any changes in the number of outstanding Shares resulting from any event referred to in Section 5.3 of the Plan.

6. ADDITIONAL FORFEITURE PROVISIONS NOT APPLICABLE. The forfeiture conditions set forth in Section 7.4 of the Plan shall not apply to all Options hereunder and to gains realized upon the exercise of the Options, except as specifically stated herein.

Unless Employee has made separate arrangements satisfactory to the Company, the Company may elect to withhold Shares deliverable in settlement of the Options having a fair market value (as determined by the Committee) equal to the amount of such tax liability required to be withheld in connection with the exercise of the Options, but the Company shall not be obligated to withhold such Shares.

(d) Statements. An individual statement of Employee’s Options will be issued to Employee at such times as may be determined by the Company. Such a statement shall reflect the number of outstanding Options credited to Employee, transactions therein during the period covered by the statement, and other information deemed relevant by the Committee.
