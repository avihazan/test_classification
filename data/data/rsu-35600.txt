the part of the Corporation and ownership of all such forfeited Restricted Shares shall be transferred back to the Corporation.  
  
Any Shares, any other securities of the Corporation and any other property (except for cash dividends) distributed with respect to the Restricted Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as such Restricted Shares.

& #160; In order to facilitate the transfer back to the Corporation of any Restricted Shares that are forfeited and cancelled as described herein, including a transfer as payment of required withholding taxes as set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement, Grantee shall, upon the request of the Corporation, provide a stock power or other instrument of assignment (including a power of attorney) endorsed in blank, with a guarantee of signature if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Corporation.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period as to any portion of Restricted Shares shall be delayed in the event the Corporation reasonably anticipates that the expiration or termination of the Restriction Period, or the delivery of unrestricted Shares would constitute a violation of federal securities laws or other applicable law. If the expiration or termination of the Restriction Period, or the de livery of unrestricted Shares, is delayed by the provisions of this Section 3(b), such expiration, termination and/or delivery shall occur at the earliest date at which the Corporation reasonably anticipates such expiration, termination or delivery will not cause a violation of federal securities laws or other applicable law. For purposes of this Section 3(b), the delivery of Shares that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not considered a violation of applicable law.

9\. Withholding of Taxes.

(a) The Grantee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of this grant or the vesting of Restricted Shares hereunder. In the event that the Corporation or the Grantee's employer (the "Employer") is required to withhold taxes as a result of the grant or vesting or subsequent sale of Shares hereunder, the Grantee shall at the election of the Corporation, in its sole discretion, either (i) surrender a sufficient number of whole Shares for which the Restricted Period has expired or other Common Shares owned by the Grantee, having a fair market value, as determined by the Corporation on the last day of the Restricted Period equal to the amount of such taxes, or (ii) make a cash payment, as necessary to cover all applicable required withholding taxes and required social security/insurance contributions at the time the restrictions on the Restricted Shares lapse, unless the Corporation, in its sole discretion, has established alternative procedures for such payment. If the number of shares required to cover all applicable withholding taxes and required social security/insurance contributions includes a fractional share, then Grantee shall deliver cash in lieu of such fractional share. All matters with respect to the total amount to be withheld shall be determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion.

(b) Regardless of any action the Corporation or the Grantee’s Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security/insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), the Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him is and remains the Grantee’s responsibility and that the Corporation and or the Employer (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this grant of Restricted Shares, including the grant, vesting or release, the subsequent sale of Shares and receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms or any aspect of this grant of Restricted Shares to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax-Related Items. The Grantee shall pay the Corporation or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Corporation or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan or the Grantee’s receipt of Restricted Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described above in Section 9(a). The Corporation may refuse to deliver the Shares related thereto if the Grantee fails to comply with the Grantee’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

(c) Grantee will notify the Corporation in writing if he or she files an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. The Grantee understands that he or she should consult with his or her tax advisor regarding the advisability of filing with the Internal Revenue Service an election under 83(b) of the Code, which must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the acquisition of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, the Grant Date. This time period cannot be extended. The Grantee acknowledges that timely filing of a Section 83(b) election is the Grantee’s sole responsibility.

10\. Plan Governs and Entire Agreement. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions thereof. The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The terms of this Agreement are subject to, and governed by, in all respects the terms and conditions of the Plan, and in the case of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern.

11\. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or the Award, or would disqualify the Plan or Award under any laws deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or, if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and Award shall remain in full force and effect.

The Restricted Shares are personal to the Grantee and may not be sold, exchanged, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of by the Grantee until the Restricted Period expires or terminates as provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Grantee’s rights with respect to such Restricted Shares may be transferred by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution.
