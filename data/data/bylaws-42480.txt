SECTION 15.

The Company may, with the approval of the Board of Trustees, enter into an agreement with any person who is, or is about to become, a Trustee or officer of the Company, or who is serving, or is about to serve, at the request of the Company, any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, as a director, officer or in any other capacity, which agreement may provide for indemnification of such person and advancement of defense expenses to such person upon such terms, and to the extent, as may be permitted by law.
