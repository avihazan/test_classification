If there shall be any other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or of any stock or other securities into which such Common Stock shall have been changed, or for which it shall have been exchanged, and if a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall, in its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment to the terms of this Option, then such adjustment shall be made in accordance with such determination.
