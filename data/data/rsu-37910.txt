By signing below, the Optionee indicates acceptance of the Option and his or her agreement to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, which, together with the terms of the Plan, shall become the Company’s Stock Option Agreement with the Optionee. The Optionee also acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan. This Agreement will not be effective until it is signed and returned.

Re: Exercise of Incentive Stock Option

Gentlemen: 

Subject to acceptance by Fauquier Bankshares, Inc.

##### 

I represent and warrant to the Company that: 

(a) I am acquiring the Stock for my own account as principal for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution. 

(b) I am not acquiring the Stock based upon any representation, oral or written, by any person with respect to the future value of, or income from, the Stock but rather upon an independent examination and judgment as to the prospects of the Company. The Stock was not offered to me by means of publicly disseminated advertisements or sales literature, nor am I aware of any offers made to other persons by such means. I am able to bear the economic risks of the investment in the Stock, including the risk of a complete loss of my investment therein. 

(c) I recognize that purchase of the Stock involves a high degree of risk and have taken full cognizance of and understand such risk. 

(d) I have and have had complete access to and the opportunity to review and make copies of all material documents related to the business of the Company, including, but not limited to, contracts, financial statements, tax returns, leases, deeds and other books and records. I have examined such of these documents as I wished and am familiar with the business and affairs of the Company. I realize that the purchase of the Stock is a speculative investment and that any possible profit therefrom is uncertain. I have had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company and any person acting on its behalf and to obtain all material information reasonably available with respect to the Company and its affairs. I have received all information to date with respect to the Company which I have requested and have deemed relevant in connection with the evaluation of the merits and risks of my investment in the Company. I have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that I am capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the purchase of the shares hereunder. I understand that the Company has relied on my representations as set forth in this Notice of Exercise in determining materiality for purposes of the disclosure obligations of the Company under federal and state securities laws. 

(e) I understand and agree that the Company shall withhold from payments made to me, or I shall remit to the Company, all amounts required to be withheld by the Company to satisfy federal and state tax withholding obligations with respect to the exercise of the Option. 

(f) I agree that my certificate(s) for the Stock will bear legends to reflect any restrictions set forth herein and in the Agreement. The agreements, representations, warranties and covenants made by me herein extend to and apply to all of the Stock of the Company issued to me pursuant to the Option. Acceptance by me of the certificate representing such Stock shall constitute a confirmation that all such agreements, representations, warranties and covenants made herein shall be true and correct at such time. 

I would like the Stock to be registered in the name(s) of  as
