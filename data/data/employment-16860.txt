The determination of incapacity or disability under the preceding sentence shall be made in good faith by the Company based upon information supplied by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and reasonably acceptable to the Employee or his legal representative. During any period that the Employee fails to perform his duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness (the “Disability Period”), the Employee shall continue to receive his full Base Salary hereunder until his employment is terminated pursuant to this Section 4.2, provided that amounts payable to the Employee shall be reduced by the sum of the 

* * *

  


amounts, if any, paid to the Employee during the Disability Period under any disability benefit plans of the Company. If the Employee is terminated pursuant to this Section 4.2 the Company shall pay to the Employee (or his legal representative) (i) Severance and Acceleration Payment (as such terms are defined in Section 4.4.1 below), and (ii) all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the Employee in the performance of his duties hereunder prior to the date of termination due to disability.

4.3 Termination by Company.

In the event the Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company for “Cause”, the Employee shall be entitled to continue to receive Base Salary accrued but unpaid and expenses incurred but not repaid to the Employee, in each case only until the effective date of such termination.

5. Covenant Not to Disclose Confidential Information. During the Agreement Term, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, the Employee acknowledges that during the course of his affiliation with the Company he has or will have access to and knowledge of certain information and data which the Company considers confidential and/or proprietary and the release of such information or data to unauthorized persons would be extremely detrimental to the Company. As a consequence, the Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that he owes a duty to the Company not to disclose, and agrees that without the prior written consent of the Company, at any time, either during or after his employment with the Company, he will not communicate, publish or disclose, to any person anywhere, or use, any Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), except as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct his duties hereunder, provided the Employee is acting in good faith and in the best interest of the Company. The Employee will use his best efforts at all times to hold in confidence and to safeguard any Confidential Information from falling into the hands of any unauthorized person and, in particular, will not permit any Confidential Information to be read, duplicated or copied. The Employee will return to the Company all Confidential Information in the Employee’s possession or under the Employee’s control when the duties of the Employee no longer require the Employee’s possession thereof, or whenever the Company shall so request, and in any event will promptly return all such Confidential Information if the Employee’s relationship with the Company is terminated for any or no reason and will not retain any copies thereof. For purposes hereof, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean any information or data used by or belonging or relating to the Company whether communication is verbal or in writing that is not known generally to the industry in which the Company is or may be engaged, including without limitation, any and all trade secrets, proprietary data and information relating to the Company’s business and products, intellectual property, patents, or copyrightable works, price list, customer lists, processes, procedures or standards, know-how, manuals, business strategies, records, drawings, specifications, designs, financial information, whether or not reduced to writing, or information or data which the Company advises the Employee should be treated as Confidential Information.

6. Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement. The Employee acknowledges that he, at the expense of the Company, has been and will be specially trained in the business of the Company, has established and will continue to establish favorable relations with the customers, clients and accounts of the Company and will have access to trade secrets of the Company. Therefore, in consideration of such training and relations and to further protect trade secrets, directly or indirectly, of the Company, the Employee agrees that during the term of his employment by the Company, and for a period of one (1) year from and after the voluntary or involuntary termination of such employment for any or no reason, he will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written consent of the Company:

(a) own or have any interest in or act as an officer, director, partner, principal, employee, agent, representative, consultant or independent contractor of, or in any way assist in, any business located in or doing business in the United States of America or Canada in any area within one hundred (100) miles of any facility of the Company during the term of the Employee’s employment, by the Company which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in (i) the solid waste processing, disposal and management business, (ii) the utilization of recyclable materials business or (iii) any other business the Company is engaged in or proposes to engage in on the date this Agreement, or subsequently, at the date of termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, businesses in the nature of, or relating to, waste reduction, the creation of power or fuels out of waste, landfill gas to energy or gasification businesses (the businesses described in clauses (a)(i), (ii) and (iii) are collectively referred to as the “Competitive

* * *

  


Businesses”); provided, however, that notwithstanding the above, the Employee may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any such person which are traded on any national securities exchange or NASDAQ if the Employee (A) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person and (B) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such person;

(b) solicit clients, customers (who are or were customers of the Company, or were prospects to be customers of the Company, within the twelve (12) months prior to termination) or accounts of the Company for, on behalf of or otherwise related to any such Competitive Businesses or any products related thereto; or

(c) solicit, employ or in any manner influence or encourage any person who is or shall be in the employ or service of the Company to leave such employ or service.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this covenant not to compete shall be enforceable against Employee only to the extent that during Employee’s employment the Company continues to pay Employee compensation equal to the salary level set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement and after termination of Employee’s employment the Company continues to pay Employee any and all Severance Benefits, Severance and the Acceleration Payment as required under Section 4 of this Agreement. Furthermore, if any court determines that the covenant not to compete, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic area or scope covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration, area or scope of such provisions and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.

7. Assignment of Inventions and Work. Employee hereby agrees to disclose in writing to Company any current, past or future Inventions or copyrightable Works, which have been or are now or in the future conceived, made, discovered, written or created by Employee, alone and/or in combination with others, during Employee’s prior, current or future employment, and that Employee will, voluntarily and without additional consideration, assign all rights and title to such Inventions or Works to Company.

8. Specific Performance. Recognizing that irreparable damage will result to the Company in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any of the foregoing covenants and assurances by the Employee contained in Sections 5, 6 or 7 hereof, and that the Company’s remedies at law for any such breach or threatened breach will be inadequate, the Company and its successors and assigns, in addition to such other remedies which may be available to them, shall be entitled to an injunction, including a mandatory injunction, to be issued by any court of competent jurisdiction ordering compliance with this Agreement or enjoining and restraining the Employee, and each and every person, firm or company acting in concert or participation with him, from the continuation of such breach.

9. Potential Unenforceability of Any Provision. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that he has had an opportunity to seek advice of counsel in connection with this Agreement. If a final judicial determination is made that any provision of this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against the Employee, the provisions hereof shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial determination finds such provisions unenforceable, and such unenforceable provisions shall automatically be reconstituted and became a part of this Agreement, effective as of the date first written above, to the maximum extent in favor of the Company that is 

* * *

  


lawfully enforceable. A judicial determination that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable shall in no instance render the entire Agreement unenforceable, but rather the Agreement will continue in full force and effect absent any unenforceable provision to the maximum extent permitted by law.

10. General Release. Employee recognizes, understands and agrees that the provision of this Agreement by the Company, and its terms of employment, as well as its terms of Severance, Severance Benefits and the Acceleration Payment are generous and extraordinary, and that in consideration thereof, Employee agrees in this Agreement that in advance of and as a condition to the receipt of such Severance Benefits, Severance and the Acceleration Payment, if any, to execute a General Release as set forth hereto as Exhibit 1. Employee understands and agrees that no Severance Benefits, Severance and the Acceleration Payment will be made to Employee unless Exhibit 1 has been executed by Employee, and all waiting periods provided for therein have been exhausted or extinguished.
