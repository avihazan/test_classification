The Employee represents and warrants that he is not party to, or bound by, any agreement or commitment, or subject to any restriction, including but not limited to agreements related to previous employment containing confidentiality or noncompetition covenants, which limit the ability of the Employee to perform his duties under this Agreement.

5\. Confidentiality, etc.

For purposes of this Section 5, all references to the Company shall be deemed to include the Company’s affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries, whether now existing or hereafter established or acquired. In consideration for the compensation and benefits provided to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement, the Employee agrees with the provisions of this Section 5. The “Restrictive Period” is defined as one (1) year, commencing from date employment terminates with the Company (hereafter referred to as “Termination Date”) through the first (1st) anniversary of Termination Date.

(a) Confidential Information. (i) The Employee acknowledges that as a result of his retention by the Company, the Employee has and will continue to have knowledge of, and access to, proprietary and confidential information of the Company including, without limitation, research and development plans and results, software, databases, technology, inventions, trade secrets, technical information, know-how, plans, specifications, methods of operations, product and service information, product and service availability, pricing information (including pricing strategies), financial, business and marketing information and plans, and the identity of customers, clients and suppliers (collectively, the “Confidential Information”), and that the Confidential Information, even though it may be contributed, developed or acquired by the Employee, constitutes valuable, special and unique assets of the Company developed at great expense which are the exclusive property of the Company. Accordingly, the Employee shall not, at any time, either during or subsequent to the Term of this Agreement, use, reveal, report, publish, transfer or otherwise disclose to any person, corporation, or other entity, any of the Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company, except to responsible officers and employees of the Company and other responsible persons who are in a contractual or fiduciary relationship with the Company and who have a need for such Confidential Information for purposes in the best interests of the Company, and except for such Confidential Information which is or becomes of general public knowledge from authorized sources other than by or through the Employee.

(ii) The Employee acknowledges that the Company would not enter into this Agreement without the assurance that all the Confidential Information will be used for the exclusive benefit of the Company.

(b) Return of Confidential Information. Upon the termination of this Agreement or upon the request of the Company, the Employee shall promptly return to the Company all Confidential Information in his possession or control, including but not limited to all drawings, manuals, computer printouts, computer databases, disks, data, files, lists, memoranda, letters, notes, notebooks, reports and other writings and copies thereof and all other materials relating to the Company’s business, including, without limitation, any materials incorporating Confidential Information.

  


(c) Inventions, etc. During the Term and for a period of one year thereafter, the Employee will promptly disclose to the Company all designs, processes, inventions, improvements, developments, discoveries, processes, techniques, and other information related to the business of the Company conceived, developed, acquired, or reduced to practice by him alone or with others during the Term of this Agreement, whether or not conceived during regular working hours, through the use of Company time, material or facilities or otherwise (“Inventions”).

The Employee agrees that all copyrights created in conjunction with his service to the Company and other Inventions, are “works made for hire” (as that term is defined under the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended). All such copyrights, trademarks, and other Inventions shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and the Company shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other rights and protection in connection therewith. To the extent any such copyright and other Inventions may not be works for hire, the Employee hereby assigns to the Company any and all rights he now has or may hereafter acquire in such copyrights and any other Inventions. Upon request the Employee shall deliver to the Company all drawings, models and other data and records relating to such copyrights, trademarks and Inventions. The Employee further agrees as to all such Inventions, to assist the Company in every proper way (but at the Company’s expense) to obtain, register, and from time to time enforce patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other rights and protection relating to said Inventions in any and all countries, and to that end the Employee shall execute all documents for use in applying for and obtaining such patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other rights and protection on and enforcing such Inventions, as the Company may reasonably request, together with any assignments thereof to the Company or persons designated by it. Such obligation to assist the Company shall continue beyond the termination of the Employee’s service to the Company, but the Company shall compensate the Employee at a reasonable rate after termination of service for time actually spent by the Employee at the Company’s request for such assistance. In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure the Employee’s signature on any document or documents needed to apply for or prosecute any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other right or protection relating to an Invention, whether because of the Employee’s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, the Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two years after termination of this Agreement, as his agent coupled with an interest and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in his behalf and stead to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or similar rights or protection thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by the Employee.

The Employee agrees not to utilize his special knowledge of the Business and his relationships with customers, prospective customers, suppliers and others or otherwise to compete with the Company in the Business during the Restricted Period. During the Restricted Period, the Employee shall not, and shall not permit any of his respective employees, agents or others under his control, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Employee or any other Person, to engage or have an interest, anywhere in the world in which the Company conducts business or markets or sells its products, alone or in association with others, as principal, officer, agent, employee, director, partner or stockholder (except as an owner of two percent or less of the stock of any company listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market), whether through the investment of capital, lending of money or property, rendering of services or capital, or otherwise, in any Competitive Business. During the Restricted Period, the Employee shall not, and shall not permit any of his respective employees, agents or others under his control, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Employee or any other Person, to accept Competitive Business from, or solicit the Competitive Business of any Person who is a customer of the Business conducted by the Company, or, to the Employee’s knowledge, is a customer of the Business conducted by the Company at any time during the Restricted Period.

6. Remedies. The restrictions set forth in Section 5 are considered by the parties to be fair and reasonable. The Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Section 5 will not prevent him from earning a livelihood. The Employee further acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably harmed and that monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach of the provisions of Section 5. Accordingly, the Employee agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available to the Company, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to secure the enforcement of these provisions. In connection with seeking any such equitable remedy, including, but not limited to, an injunction or specific performance, the Company shall not be required to post a bond as a condition to obtaining such remedy. In any such litigation, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If any provisions of Sections 5 or 6 relating to the time period, scope of activities or geographic area of restrictions is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum permissible time period, scope of activities or geographic area, the maximum time period, scope of activities or geographic area, as the case may be, shall be reduced to the maximum which such court deems enforceable. If any provisions of Sections 5 or 6 other than those described in the preceding sentence are adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended (with respect only to the jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made) in such manner as to render them enforceable and to effectuate as nearly as possible the original intentions and agreement of the parties. For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Company shall be deemed to include the Company's affiliates and subsidiaries, whether now existing or hereafter established or acquired.

7. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate at the end of the Term set forth in Section 1. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of the Term set forth in Section 1 upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in, and subject to the terms of, this Section 7.

If the Employee is unable to perform his normal duties for the Company because of illness or incapacity (whether physical or mental) for 45 consecutive days during the Term of this Agreement, or for 60 days (whether or not consecutive) out of any calendar year during the Term of this Agreement, his disability shall be deemed to have become permanent. If this Agreement is terminated on account of the death or permanent disability of the Employee, then the Employee or his estate shall be entitled to receive accrued Base Compensation through the date of such termination, all granted but unvested stock options held by the Employee shall immediately vest and the Employee or the Employee’s estate, as applicable, shall have no further entitlement to Base Compensation, bonus, stock options or benefits from the Company following the effective date of such termination, except as provided in Section 3(b) and the last two sentences of Section 3(c) of this Agreement; provided, however, that any bonus pursuant to Section 3(b) of this Agreement shall be paid only for the year in which such termination occurred pro rated for the portion of such year prior to such termination and shall be paid at such time as the Board determines the bonuses for all senior executive officers of the Company for such year, but no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which it was earned.
