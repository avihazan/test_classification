As used herein, “Cause” shall mean any of the following: (i) an act of willful misconduct or gross negligence by Employee in the performance of his material duties or obligations to the Company; if such act is capable of cure, Employee shall be given written notice and such act shall not be deemed a basis for Cause if cured within 60 days after written notice is received by Employee specifying the alleged failure in reasonable detail (and during such 60 day period, Employee shall continue to be employed by the Company at full pay), or (ii) conviction of Employee of a felony involving moral turpitude or (iii) a material act of dishonesty or breach of trust on the part of Employee resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in personal gain or enrichment at the expense of the Company. 

6\. Termination by Employee. Employee may terminate this Agreement at anytime with or without reason on 30 days’ prior written notice. 

7\. Payment and Other Provisions Upon Termination. 

a. In the event Employee’s employment with the Company (including its subsidiaries) is terminated by the Company for Cause as provided in Paragraph 5 of this Agreement, then, on or before Employee’s last day of employment with the Company, the Company shall pay in a lump sum to Employee at the time of Employee’s termination an amount equal the unpaid salary due to the Employee for services performed prior to the date of termination of employment. Any and all other rights granted to Employee under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of termination. This same provision shall apply if Employee terminates his employment with the Company, with or without reason. 

b. In the event that Employee’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Employee for Good Reason (as defined below), Employee shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to three (3) months of Employee’s Base Salary payable within twenty (20) business days of such termination. As used herein, “Good Reason” shall mean: (i) material diminution in the nature or scope of the Employee’s responsibilities, duties or authority, but excluding for these purposes an isolated and insubstantial action not taken in bad faith which is remedied by Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by Employee and actions taken by the Company related to Employee’s performance of assigned duties; (ii) a material reduction in the compensation payable to the Employee; and (iii) relocation of the Employee’s principal worksite more than 50 miles from its current site, without Employee’s agreement in writing.

c. Regardless of the circumstances of termination of employment, the Company shall pay Employee the value of all accrued but unused vacation time. 

8\. Termination by Reason of Death. If Employee shall die while employed by the Company during the Term, all Employee’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate with the payment of such amounts of annual Base Salary as have accrued but remain unpaid through the month in which his death occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the death of Employee, the Company shall pay Employee’s estate the value of all accrued but unused vacation time. 

9\. Termination by Disability. Employee’s employment hereunder may be terminated by the Company forthwith in the event of Disability (as defined below). In such event, all Employee’s rights shall be governed by the applicable disability policies of the Company as then in effect and all Employee’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the Disability of Employee, the Company shall pay Employee’s estate the value of all accrued but unused vacation time. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that, as a result of Employee’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness or similar incapacity: (a) Employee shall have been absent from his duties hereunder on a substantially full-time basis for six (6) consecutive months; and (b) within thirty (30) days after the Company notifies Employee in writing that it intends to replace him, Employee shall not have returned to the performance of his duties hereunder on a full-time basis. 

10\. Non-competition. 

a. At all times during Employee’s employment hereunder, and for a period equal to the longer of (i) one (1) year after termination of employment with the Company or (ii) three (3) years from the Effective Date, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in any business, (except where approved by the Company in writing in advance), whether as owner, operator, shareholder (except as a holder of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any company traded on a national securities exchange or actively traded in a national over-the-counter market), director, partner, creditor, consultant, agent, employee or in any other capacity whatsoever that manufactures products or provides services that compete, in any material respect, directly with products or services of the Company (its affiliates, parents, subsidiaries or predecessors in interest) or markets such products anywhere in the world where the Company (its affiliates, parents, subsidiaries or predecessors in interest) (i) is engaged in business or (ii) has evidenced an intention of engaging in business and for which the Company, its affiliates, parents, or its subsidiaries prepared a business plan or study or committed resources of the Company to investigate on or before the date of termination of Employee’s employment. Employee acknowledges that he has read the foregoing and agrees that the nature of the geographical restrictions are reasonable given the international nature of the Company’s business. 

In the event that these geographical or temporal restrictions are judicially determined to be unreasonable, the parties agree that these restrictions shall be judicially reformed to the maximum restrictions which are reasonable. 

b. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Paragraph 10a., Employee may accept employment with a company that would be deemed to be a competitor of the Company (its affiliates, parents, subsidiaries or predecessors in interest) as described in the previous sentence (“Competitor”), so long as (i) the Competitor has had annual revenues of at least $1 billion in each of the prior two fiscal years, (ii) the Competitor’s revenues for products and maintenance in direct competition with the Company does not exceed 50% of its total revenues and (iii) Employee’s responsibilities are solely for divisions or subsidiaries of the Competitor that do not compete with the Company (its affiliates, subsidiaries or predecessors in interest).

Waldie, Richard S.J. Stevenson, Peter Cronk or Matthew Ramsay; provided, however, that the Employee obtains a prior written approval from the Company, which will not be unreasonably withheld or (b) call on or solicit any of the actual or targeted prospective customers of the Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries or predecessors in interest with respect to any matters related to or competitive with the business of the Company. 

12\. Confidentiality. 

a. Nondisclosure. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information (as defined below) is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Company’s business. Accordingly, except in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder, Employee shall not at any time during or subsequent to the term of his employment hereunder disclose, directly or indirectly, to any person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other entity any proprietary or confidential information relating to the Company or any information concerning the Company’s financial condition, business line, business strategy or prospects, the Company’s customers, the design, research, development, manufacture, marketing or sale of the Company’s products, or the Company’s methods of operating its business, or intellectual property of any kind, which shall include, without limitation, inventions, improvements, discoveries, creations, computer programs, computer hardware, design specifications, concepts, formulas, trade secrets, ideas, processes, know-how, methods, proprietary data, software code, source code, products, future products, techniques, any and all derivative works therefrom and any and all patents and copyrights therein or any improvements thereof (collectively “Confidential Information”).

Upon termination of Employee’s employment, for whatever reason and whether voluntary or involuntary, or at any time at the request of the Company, Employee shall promptly return all Confidential Information in the possession or under the control of Employee to the Company and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof. Employee shall at any time at the request of the Company destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, and documents, whether in “hard copy” form or as stored on magnetic or other media, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, prepared by Employee and shall provide the Company with a certificate that the foregoing materials have in fact been returned or destroyed.   
  
c. Books and Records. All books, records and accounts whether prepared by Employee or otherwise coming into Employee’s possession, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and shall be returned immediately to the Company upon termination of Employee’s employment hereunder or upon the Company’s request at any time.   
  
13\. Injunction/Specific Performance Setoff. Employee acknowledges that a breach of any of the provisions of Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 hereof would result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Company 

4 

* * *

which cannot be adequately or reasonably compensated at law. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company shall be entitled, if any such breach shall occur or be threatened or attempted, to a decree of specific performance and to a temporary and permanent injunction, without the posting of a bond, enjoining and restraining such breach by Employee or his agents, either directly or indirectly, and that such right to injunction shall be cumulative to whatever other remedies for actual damages to which the Company is entitled. Employee further acknowledges that the Company may have additional remedies set forth in other agreements that may be in effect between Employee and the Company that are available to the Company in the event of a breach of any or all of the provisions of Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 hereof and that nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of such remedies set forth in such other agreements. 

14\. Copyright and Other Intellectual Property. All works, designs, written material, ideas, inventions and the like produced or developed by the Employee in the course of the employment remain the property of the Company. 

15\. Severability. Any provision in this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

16\. Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company and any permitted successor of the Company. Neither this Agreement nor any rights arising hereunder may be assigned or pledged by: Employee or anyone claiming through Employee; or by the Company, except to any corporation which is the successor in interest to the Company by reason of a merger, consolidation, share exchange or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company. 

17\. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be written and sent by registered or certified mail, telecommunicated or hand delivered at the address set forth herein or to any other address of which notice is given:

18. Survivability. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 2, the provisions of Paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement. 

19\. Miscellaneous.
