A. The Corporation has implemented the Plan as an equity incentive program to encourage key employees and officers of the Corporation and the non-employee members of the Board to remain in the employ or service of the Corporation by providing them with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the success of the Corporation.

C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix A. 

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows: 

1\. Grant of Restricted Stock Units. The Corporation hereby awards to Participant, as of the Award Date, restricted stock units under the Plan. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the awarded restricted stock units and the applicable performance vesting requirement for those units and the underlying shares are set forth in the Award Summary below.

2\. Limited Transferability. Prior to the actual issuance of the Shares which vest hereunder, Participant may not transfer any interest in the restricted stock units subject to the Award or the underlying Shares or pledge or otherwise hedge the sale of those units or Shares, including (without limitation) any short sale or any acquisition or disposition of any put or call option or other instrument tied to the value of those Shares. However, any Shares which vest hereunder but otherwise remain unissued at the time of Participant’s death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of Participant’s will or the laws of inheritance or to Participant’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. Participant may make such a beneficiary designation at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designee. 

3\. Vesting Requirements. The Shares subject to the Award shall initially be unvested and shall vest only in accordance with the vesting provisions of this Paragraph 3 or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraph 5. The actual number of Shares in which Participant shall vest under this Paragraph 3 shall be determined as follows: 

(a) Performance Vesting: As soon as administratively practicable following the completion of the Performance Period, the Plan Administrator shall, on the basis of the Corporation’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year coincident with such Performance Period, determine whether the Performance Goal for that period has been attained. If the Performance Goal has not been attained, then the restricted stock units hereby awarded shall be immediately cancelled, and Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any of the Shares underlying those cancelled units. Should the Plan Administrator determine and certify, on the basis of such audited financial statements, that the Performance Goal for the Performance Period has been attained, then the Shares subject to this Award shall be re-designated as Performance Shares, and the number of those Performance Shares in which Participant may vest shall be dependent upon his or her completion of the Service vesting requirements set forth below. 

(b) Service Vesting: The Participant shall vest in twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Shares upon his or her continuation in Employee status through the completion of the Performance Period. Participant shall vest in the remaining Performance Shares upon his or her completion of each successive twelve (12)-month period of continued Service over the thirty-six (36)-month period measured from  , 200 . 

(c) Cessation of Service. In no event shall Participant vest in any additional Performance Shares following his or her cessation of Service. Accordingly, should Participant cease Service for any reason prior to vesting in one or more Shares subject to this Award, then the Award will be immediately cancelled with respect to those unvested Shares, and the number of restricted stock units will be reduced accordingly. Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled units, and those Shares shall cease to be subject to this Award.

4\. Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents

(a) The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting, dividend or liquidation rights, with respect to the Shares subject to the Award until Participant becomes the record holder of those Shares following their actual issuance upon the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any dividend or other distribution payable other than in shares of Class A Common Stock, whether regular or extraordinary, be declared and paid on the Corporation’s outstanding Class A Common Stock in one or more calendar years during which Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then a special book account shall be established for Participant and credited with a phantom dividend equivalent to the actual dividend or distribution which would have been paid on the Shares had such Shares been issued and outstanding and entitled to that dividend or distribution. As the Shares subsequently vest in one or more installments hereunder, the phantom dividend equivalents credited to those Shares in the book account shall be distributed to Participant (in cash or such other form as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in its sole discretion) concurrently with the issuance of the vested Shares to which those phantom dividend equivalents relate. However, each such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the Withholding Taxes applicable to that distribution. 

5\. Change in Control. Should a Change in Control be effected at a time when one or more unvested Shares remain subject to this Award, then Participant shall, immediately prior to the closing of that Change in Control transaction, vest in all those unvested Shares. The Shares so vested shall be issued immediately on the effective date of such Change in Control or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event more than fifteen (15) business days after such effective date, or shall otherwise be converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Class A Common Stock payable to the other holders of such Class A Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control and distributed at the same time as such stockholder payments, but in no event shall such distribution to Participant be completed later than the later of (i) the end of the calendar year in which such Change in Control is effected or (ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following the effective date of that Change in Control. Each issuance or distribution made under this Paragraph 5 shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

6\. Adjustment in Shares. Should any change be made to the Class A Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other change affecting the outstanding Class A Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, or should the value of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, or should there occur any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, then

##### 

equitable adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award in order to reflect such change and thereby prevent a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. In making such equitable adjustments, the Plan Administrator shall take into account any amounts credited to Participant’s book account under Paragraph 4(b) in connection with the transaction, and the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. However, in the event of a Change of Control, the adjustments (if any) shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 13.8 of the Plan governing Change of Control transactions. Notwithstanding the above, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Corporation shall not be deemed to have been effected without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration. 

7\. Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. 

(a) The Performance Shares in which Participant vests in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3 shall be issued in accordance with the following provisions: 

(i) The first twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Shares shall be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the Plan Administrator’s determination and certification, based on the Corporation’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year coincident with the Performance Period, that the Performance Goal for that period has been attained. The Performance Shares subject to each subsequent installment in which Participant vests on the basis of his or her continued Service shall be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the applicable vesting date for that installment. In no event shall any Performance Shares which vest in accordance with Paragraph 3 be issued later than the later of (A) the last day of the calendar year in which the particular vesting date for those shares occurs or (B the fifteenth (15th) day of third (3rd) calendar month following such vesting date. The phantom dividend equivalents credited to the Participant’s book account under Paragraph 4(b) shall be distributed concurrently with the issuance of the vested Performance Shares to which they relate. 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5, no Shares shall be issued prior to the completion of the Performance Period. 

(b) The Corporation shall collect the Withholding Taxes with respect to each distribution of phantom dividend equivalents by withholding a portion of that distribution equal to the amount of the applicable Withholding Taxes, with the cash portion of the distribution to be the first portion so withheld. 

(c) The Corporation shall collect the applicable Withholding Taxes with respect to all Shares which vest pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement through the following automatic share withholding method:

* * *

##### 

\- On the applicable issuance date, the Corporation shall withhold, from the vested Shares otherwise issuable to Participant at that time, a portion of those Shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the applicable Withholding Taxes; provided, however, that the number of Shares which the Corporation shall be required to so withhold shall not exceed in Fair Market Value the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporation’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 or this Paragraph 7, the settlement of all restricted stock units which vest under the Award shall be made solely in shares of Common Stock. In no event, however, shall any fractional shares be issued. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued at the time the Award vests shall, to the extent necessary, be rounded down to the next whole share in order to avoid the issuance of a fractional share. 

8\. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Award shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any Stock Exchange on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such issuance. 

9\. Notices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and addressed to Participant at the most recent address then on file for Participant in the Corporation’s Human Resources Department. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

10\. Successors and Assigns. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns and Participant and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Participant’s estate and any beneficiaries of the Award designated by Participant. 

11\. Construction. This Agreement and the Award evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. All decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in the Award. 

12\. Governing Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona without resort to that State’s conflict-of-laws rules.
