So long as the Executive is employed by the Company and for a period of eighteen (18) months after either (i) the voluntary termination of employment by Executive or (ii) the termination of the Executive by the Company for cause, as set forth in Section 8(b) hereof, the Executive specifically agrees that he will not, for himself, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, firm, corporation or entity, other than the Company (either as principal, employee, shareholder, member, director, partner, consultant, owner or part-owner of any corporation, partnership or any type of business entity) anywhere in any county in which the Company is doing business at the time of termination, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, participate in, or be connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation, or control of any business similar to the type of business conducted by the Company at the time of termination of the Executive's employment.

Executive's Acknowledgments and Agreements. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that:

(1) Due to the nature of the Company's business, the foregoing covenants place no greater restraint upon the Executive than is reasonably necessary to protect the business and goodwill of the Company; 

(2) These covenants protect a legitimate interest of the Company and do not serve solely to limit the Company's future competition;

(4) A breach of these covenants by the Executive would cause irreparable damage to the Company;

(5) These covenants will not preclude the Executive from becoming gainfully employed following termination of employment with the Company;

Remedies, Injunction. In the event of the Executive's actual or threatened breach of any provisions of this Agreement, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction restraining and enjoining the Executive from violating the provisions herein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Executive. The Executive further agrees that for the purpose of any such injunction proceeding, it shall be presumed that the Company's legal remedies would be inadequate and that the Company would suffer irreparable harm as a result of the Executive's violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In any proceeding brought by the Company to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no other matter relating to the terms of any claim or cause of action of the Executive against the Company will be defense thereto.
