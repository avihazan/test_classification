8\. Seller acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts different from or in addition to those now known or believed to be true with respect to any or all controversies, disputes, claims, demands, or causes of action described above and agrees that this instrument shall be and remain effective in all respects notwithstanding any such differences or additional facts. With the advice of counsel, Seller has read and understood the following language contained in Section 1542 of the California Civil Code: 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

Having reviewed this provision, and with the advice of counsel, upon the execution of this Agreement, and in consideration for the promises set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration received, the receipt, adequacy, and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by Seller and Acquiror, Seller voluntarily waives and relinquishes any and all rights or benefits Seller may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or under any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law, that is similar, comparable, or equivalent in effect to California Civil Code Section 1542, and fully releases the IPC Released Parties from any and all unknown claims of any kind whatsoever occurring or existing at any time in the past up to and including the date of this Agreement, except for the obligations expressly created or reserved by this Agreement. Seller acknowledges, and shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and a key element of the Agreement of which this release is a part. 

9\. Upon the execution of this Agreement, and in consideration for the promises set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration received, the receipt, adequacy, and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by Seller and Acquiror, and to the extent permitted by law, at no time subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will Seller file, maintain, or execute upon, or cause or permit the filing or maintenance or execution upon, in any state, federal or foreign court, or before any local, state, federal, or foreign administrative or regulatory agency, or any other tribunal, any judgment, charge, claim, or action of any kind, nature, and character whatsoever, known or unknown, which Seller released under Sections 7 and 8, above. Seller also warrants that neither Seller, nor anyone acting on Seller’s behalf, has filed any claim, charge, or action against any of IPC Released Parties based in whole or in part on any matter covered by Section 7, above. Seller also agrees not to file or maintain against the IPC Released Parties any judgment, charge, claim, or action of any kind in a representative, collective, or class capacity on behalf of others.

11\. The parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
