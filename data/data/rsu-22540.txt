(a) the  -year anniversary of the Date of Grant;

(b) be signed by the person or persons entitled to exercise the Option and, if the Option is being exercised by any person or persons other than the Participant, be accompanied by proof, satisfactory to the Company, of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.

6\. Withholding. The Participant shall make satisfactory arrangements for the withholding of any amounts necessary for withholding in accordance with applicable federal or state income tax laws. 

7\. Issuance of Shares. No person shall be, or have any of the rights or privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to an Option unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued and delivered to such person. As a condition of any issuance of a certificate for Shares, the Committee may obtain such agreements or undertakings, if any, as it may deem necessary or advisable to assure compliance with any provision of the Plan, the Option Agreement or any law or regulation including, but not limited to, the following: 

(a) A representation, warranty or agreement by the Participant to the Company at the time any Option is exercised that he or she is acquiring the Shares to be issued to him or her for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any such Shares; and

(b) A representation, warranty or agreement to be bound by any legends that are, in the opinion of the Committee, necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of any securities laws deemed by the Committee to be applicable to the issuance of the Shares and are endorsed upon the Share certificates. 

8\. Surrender of Option. Upon exercise of this Option in part, if requested by the Company, the Participant shall deliver this Option and any other written agreements executed by the Company and the Participant with respect to this Option to the Company, which shall endorse or cause to be endorsed thereon a notation of such exercise and return all such agreements to the Participant.

10\. Company Reservation. After the Date of Termination of the Participant for whatever reason, including for Cause, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase from the Participant (or his or her heirs, devisees or personal representatives) all or any part of the Shares that have been previously purchased, or are thereafter purchased, by the Participant (or his or her heirs, devisees or personal representatives) upon any exercise of this Option. Such right may be exercised by the Company (i) as to any Shares purchased prior to the Date of Termination, at any time within 60 days after the Date of Termination or (ii) as to any Shares purchased after the Date of Termination, at any time within 30 days after such purchase. The repurchase price per Share payable by the Company will equal the Share’s Fair Market Value on the Date of Termination. Subject to effecting satisfactory tax withholding arrangements, if agreed between the Participant (or the person or persons exercising this Option) and the Company, the Exercise Price for any Shares being purchased from the Company after the Date of Termination may be netted against the purchase price payable by the Company. 

11\. Administration. The Plan and this Option shall be administered by the Committee as provided for and described in the Plan.
