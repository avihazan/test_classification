If (i) this Agreement is not renewed pursuant to Section 1 or (ii) the Executive’s employment is terminated (A) without Cause by FTD (other than during the Change of Control Severance Period) or (B) by the Executive following the Executive’s assignment to a position that represents a material diminution in the Executive’s operating responsibilities (other than during the Change of Control Severance Period) (it being understood that a change in the Executive’s title shall not by itself entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive’s employment and

##

For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following events that FTD or the Board has determined, in good faith, has occurred: (i) the Executive’s continual or deliberate neglect of the performance of the Executive’s material duties; (ii) the Executive’s failure to devote substantially all of the Executive’s working time to the business of FTD and its subsidiaries or affiliated companies; (iii) the Executive’s engaging willfully in misconduct in connection with the performance of any of the Executive’s duties, including, without limitation, the misappropriation of funds or securing or attempting to secure personally any profit in connection with any transaction entered into on behalf of FTD or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies; (iv) the Executive’s willful breach of any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements with FTD (including this Agreement) or the Executive’s violation, in any material respect, of any code or standard of behavior generally applicable to employees or executive employees of FTD; (v) the Executive’s active disloyalty to FTD, including, without limitation, willfully aiding a competitor or improperly disclosing confidential information; or (vi) the Executive’s engaging in conduct that may reasonably result in material injury to the reputation of FTD, including conviction or entry of a plea of nolo contendre for a felony or any crime involving fraud or embezzlement under federal, state or local laws.

# 5. Confidential Information and Non-Competition. The Executive and FTD previously entered into the Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement, which provides for (a) non-disclosure of confidential information, (b) non-competition and (c) non-solicitation of customers, suppliers and employees. The Executive hereby acknowledges that such agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof from and after the date hereof and that such continuing force and effect is a material inducement to FTD’s entering into this Agreement.  Any severance payment made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute consideration for both the Executive’s termination of employment and the Executive’s agreement regarding non-competition set forth herein and in the Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement.

# 

# 6. Limitation on Payments and Benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that it shall be determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment or distribution by FTD or any of its affiliates to the Executive or for the Executive’s benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the

# lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (or any successor provision thereto), by reason of being considered “contingent on a change in ownership or control” of FTD within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto), or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes, then such payments and benefits to be paid or provided shall be reduced to an amount (but not below zero) that would result in the maximum possible net after tax receipts to the Executive from all such payments or distributions (determined by reference to the present value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) of all such payments net of all such taxes, or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) that applied to the Executive’s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year) (the “Reduced Amount”). The fact that the Executive’s payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this paragraph will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any of the Executive’s other rights other than pursuant to this Agreement. If it is determined that the Executive should receive a Reduced Amount, FTD will provide the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. The Executive will then be entitled to designate the payments or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this paragraph. In the event that the Executive fails to make such designation within ten business days of notification of the reduction in payments or benefits is required pursuant to this paragraph, FTD may effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.

# 

# 7. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. The Executive and FTD consent to jurisdiction and venue in any federal or state court in the City of Chicago. This Agreement and the Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement state the entire agreement and understanding regarding the Executive’s employment with FTD. This Agreement supercedes and replaces in its entirety the Letter Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by both the Executive and FTD. No delay or failure to exercise any right under this Agreement waives such rights under the Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is partially or completely invalid or unenforceable, then that provision shall only be ineffective to such extent of its invalidity or unenforceability, and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected. Any controversy relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, except as otherwise provided in the Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any personnel policy or manual of FTD with respect to any matter, this Agreement shall govern the matter.
