* * *

  
F.   
  
The fact that any Business Combination complies with the provisions of Section B of this Article IV shall not be construed to impose any fiduciary duty, obligation or responsibility on the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, or the Continuing Directors, or any of them, to approve such Business Combination or recommend its adoption or approval to the shareholders of the corporation, nor shall such compliance limit, prohibit or otherwise restrict in any manner the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, or the continuing Directors, or any of them, with respect to evaluations of or actions and responses taken with respect to such Business Combination.  
  
G.   
  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, this Article IV.  
  
  
ARTICLE V   


No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; provided, however, that this Article V shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under section 302A.559 or 80A.23 of the Minnesota Statutes, (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit, or (v) for any act or omission occurring prior to the effective date of this Article V. No amendment to or repeal of this Article V shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. 

  
ARTICLE VI   


The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than five nor more than twenty-one persons, who need not be shareholders. The number of directors may be increased by the shareholders or Board of Directors or decreased by the shareholders from the number of directors on the Board of Directors immediately prior to the effective date of this Article VI; provided, however, that any change in the number of directors on the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, changes at annual meetings of shareholders) shall be approved by the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined in Article IV), voting together as a single class, unless such change shall have been approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. If such change shall not have been so approved, the number of directors shall remain the same. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. 

At the 1988 annual meeting of shareholders, Class I directors shall be elected for a one-year term, Class II directors for a two-year term and Class III directors for a three-year term. At each succeeding annual meeting of shareholders beginning in 1989, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. In no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which the director's term expires and until a successor shall be elected and qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Removal of a director from 

* * *

  


office (including a director named by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship), with or without cause, shall require the affirmative vote of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of such director's predecessor. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes of preferred or preference stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by or pursuant to the applicable terms of these Articles of Incorporation, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article VI unless expressly provided by such terms. 

No person (other than a person nominated by or on behalf of the Board of Directors) shall be eligible for election as a director at any annual or special meeting of shareholders unless a written request that his or her name be placed in nomination is received from a shareholder of record by the Secretary of the corporation not less than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting, together with the written consent of such person to serve as a director. 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, this Article VI. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 9th day of January, 2002.
