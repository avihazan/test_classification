The determination of whether the conditions of (ii)(A) and (ii)(B) above have been satisfied shall be made by the Committee and approved by the Board at the Committee’s and Board’s sole discretion.

(c) During the Forfeiture Period, the shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of, and the Grantee agrees not to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of such shares, or attempt to do so, during the Forfeiture Period.

(d) During the Forfeiture Period, the Committee, in its discretion, but subject to approval by the Board, may modify and/or terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason.

4\. Termination of Employment. 

(a) Except to the extent provided in (b) below and notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the Plan, if the Grantee’s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates prior to the expiration of the Forfeiture Period, the Grantee shall, on the date employment terminates, forfeit the number of shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which the Forfeiture Period is in effect on the date employment terminates. 

(b) If the Grantee’s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated prior to the expiration of the Forfeiture Period due to the Grantee’s death, Disability, Retirement, or due to a Change of Control, the Committee may, at its sole discretion, waive part or all of the restrictions applicable to some or all of the Restricted Stock. 

5\. Plan Amendment. Upon approval of this Agreement by the Board, this Agreement shall constitute a limited-scope amendment of the provisions of the Plan that might otherwise be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Plan that might otherwise provide for more favorable vesting upon termination of employment. The Plan amendment created by the Board’s approval of this Agreement, however, shall be limited to the Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Agreement and the Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the other similar Restricted Stock Awards approved by the Board on same date that this Agreement is approved by the Board.

6\. No Right To Continued Employment. This Agreement shall not confer upon the Grantee any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary nor shall it interfere, in any way, with the right of the Company to modify the Grantee’s compensation, duties, and responsibilities, or the Company’s authority to terminate the Grantee’s employment.

7\. Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct any sums that federal, state or local tax laws require to be withheld from Grantee’s compensation from the Company upon the grant or vesting of Restricted Stock. In the alternative, the Board may require as a condition to either granting Restricted Stock or issuing Common Shares that the Grantee pay to the Company for deposit with the appropriate taxing authority, any amounts that federal, state or local tax laws require to be withheld.
