4\.

4\.

TWELFTH: From time to time any of the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada at the time in force; provided however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66- 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation’s capital stock entitled to vote thereon and 66- 2/3% of the members of the Board of Directors then holding office is required to amend those provisions of these Articles of Incorporation set forth in ARTICLES TENTH, ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH. 

THIRTEENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is authorized, subject to the bylaws, if any, adopted by the stockholders, to adopt, alter or amend the bylaws of the corporation.
