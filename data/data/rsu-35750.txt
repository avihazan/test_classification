WHEREAS, the Participant is a nonemployee director of the Company and it is important to the Company that the Participant be encouraged to remain a director of the Company; and 

WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to award to the Participant Number of Shares Granted shares of the Company’s Common Stock under the Plan subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, the Participant and the Company agree as follows:

The portion of the Restricted Stock that has vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed “Vested Stock.”

The Participant shall forfeit the unvested portion of the Award (including the underlying Restricted Stock and “Accrued Dividends”) upon the occurrence of the Participant’s Date of Termination unless the Award becomes vested under the circumstances described in paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) below. 

(i) The Award shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event which occurs prior to the Participant’s Date of Termination. 

(ii) The Award shall become fully vested upon the Participant’s Date of Termination if the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participant’s death. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to accelerate vesting of all or any portion of the Award if the Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participant’s disability or occurs under other special circumstances (as determined by the Committee).
