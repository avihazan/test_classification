4. This Award of Performance Units will vest, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, in three equal installments on each of December  ,  , December  ,  , and December  , (each a “Vesting Date”); provided, however, that if:   
  
(A) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of the Employee’s death or a Separation from Service on account of Disability, all Performance Units referenced in the chart above shall vest on such termination date and a cash amount equal to $1 for each Performance Unit shall be paid to the Employee on the date of Separation from Service; provided, however, any payment due to the Employee by reason of a Separation from Service on account of Disability shall be delayed to the extent required by Section 14(k)(i) of the Plan;   
  
(B) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the Payment Date by reason of a Separation from Service by the Company for cause (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), this Award of Performance Units (including any vested portion) will be forfeited in full and cancelled by the Company, and shall cease to be outstanding, upon such termination date; and   
  
(C) the Employee Separates from Service for any other reason, including voluntarily by the Employee, on account of Retirement, by reason of death or Disability subsequent to the end of the Performance Period, or by reason of a Separation from Service by the Company (other than for cause or by reason of death or Disability as provided in paragraphs 4(A) and 4(B)), the Employee will be eligible to receive the value of his or her vested Performance Units on the Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the terms set forth in paragraph 5 below.   
  
Any Performance Units that have not vested on or before the date that an Employee Separates from Service for any reason (other than by reason of death or Disability), (i) will not subsequently vest; and (ii) will be immediately cancelled and forfeited without payment or further obligation by the Company or any Affiliate. In addition, the Employee’s right to receive the applicable Performance Unit value in respect of vested Performance Units that have not been forfeited will be paid on the Payment Date, if, and only if, all relevant performance conditions are met, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. 

5. Each Performance Unit represents a right to receive the applicable Performance Unit value in the chart below, in cash on the Payment Date, if and only if, such Performance Unit (i) has not been forfeited prior to its Vesting Date and (ii) has vested in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   
  
The value of each Performance Unit will depend upon the Company’s actual Proportional-Adjusted EBITDA minus Mandatory CapEx (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as defined below1, over the Performance Period as compared to the performance target set forth and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Committee”) at the time of grant, as follows:   
  
ACTUAL ADJUSTED EBITDA OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD

PERFORMANCE  
UNIT VALUE  
  
Below 75% of Performance Target =

USD$ 0.00  
  
Equal to 87.5% of Performance Target =

USD$ 0.50  
  
Equal to 100% of Performance Target =

USD$ 1.00  
  
Equal to or greater than 125% of Performance Target =

USD$ 2.00  
  
1 Proportional-Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Earnings Before Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization); Addback: Interest; Subtract: Mandatory CapEx (defined as Maintenance & Environmental Capital Expenditures, excluding Environmental Capital Expenditures with Tracker Returns).

For Adjusted EBITDA levels achieved greater than 75% and less than 87.5% of performance target, greater than 87.5% and less than 100% of performance target, and greater than 100% and less than 125% of performance target, the Performance Unit value will be determined based on straight-line interpolation. The maximum value of a Performance Unit is $2.00. 

Notwithstanding the performance level achieved, the Committee may reduce or terminate the Performance Award altogether, but in no event may the Committee increase the value of a Performance Unit underlying this Award of Performance Units beyond the performance levels achieved. 

6. In addition, in the event that a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, if the Performance Units described herein have not already been previously forfeited or cancelled, such Performance Units shall become fully vested and payable in a cash amount equal to $1.00 for each Performance Unit. Payment of any amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence may be made in cash and/or securities or other property, in the Committee’s discretion, and will be made contemporaneous with the completion the Change of Control.
