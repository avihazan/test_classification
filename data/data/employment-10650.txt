  




This Employment Agreement (this “Agreement”), is made and entered into as of June 29, 2007, by and between Guideline, Inc., a New York corporation (“Company”), and Marc Litvinoff (“Employee”).

BACKGROUND

  


A.

On June 28, 2007, infoUSA Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“infoUSA”) and the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of infoUSA (the “Subsidiary”) will conduct a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, after which such subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation.  
  
B.

As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement, infoUSA has requested that the Company and Employee enter into this Agreement providing for the Employee’s employment and certain non-competition, non-interference, confidentiality and intellectual property related obligations on the part of Employee, and the Company and Employee have agreed to do the same, subject to the closing of the tender offer contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  
  
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Company and Employee, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  


1. Position. During the Employment Term (as defined below), Employee shall be employed as CEO and shall perform such duties as are consistent with such position for Company as well as such other duties as determined from time to time by Company. The Company acknowledges that in the event Employee terminates his employment as the result of any attempt by the Company to materially reduce or otherwise materially diminish Employee's job, title or Base Salary, such termination shall be considered a Termination without Cause, as set forth in Section 7(d) below. Employee shall diligently devote all of Employee’s business time to performing Employee’s duties pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and provided that such activities do not interfere with the fulfillment of Employee’s obligations hereunder in any material respect, Employee may (a) serve as a director or trustee of any charitable or non-profit entity; and (b) acquire solely as an investment any securities so long as (i) he remains a passive investor in such entity and (ii) such entity is not, directly or indirectly, in competition with Company or any of its affiliates (other than an interest of not more than 5% of the outstanding stock of any entity which is publicly traded on a national stock exchange or over-the-counter market). 

2. Term of Employment. Employee’s term of employment under this Agreement shall begin on the date that infoUSA and/or the Subsidiary accept tender of a total of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement and shall continue for five (5) years (the “Employment Term”), unless sooner terminated as described in paragraph 7. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, this Agreement shall be deemed negated and all provisions hereof shall be null and void, and Employee's current Employment Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

3. Compensation. As compensation for Employee’s services pursuant to this Agreement, Employee shall receive: 

(a)

An annual base salary of $350,000, less applicable withholdings, which shall be payable in regular periodic installments according to Company’s normal payroll practices (the “Base Salary”). Company shall review the Base Salary at least once a year to determine whether the Base Salary should be increased at Company’s discretion.

(b)

Employee shall also be entitled to participate in the Company incentive bonus plan for fiscal year 2007 (the “Incentive Bonus Plan”), as described in the documents attached hereto as Exhibit A. Such incentive bonus shall be payable on or before that date which is one month after the end of the Company’s fiscal year. Vinod Gupta, on behalf of the Company, and Employee shall negotiate and determine the structure and criteria for the Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal year 2008 and any subsequent years at a later date. Employee shall be entitled to receive a prorated portion of the incentive bonus he would have been entitled to receive under the Incentive Bonus Plan in any year in which Employee is terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(d).  
  
(c)

Employee shall also be entitled to receive an automobile allowance in the amount of $500 per month during the term of his employment.  
  
(d)

Employee shall receive a one-time sign-on bonus of $200,000, less applicable withholdings, payable within 10 business days of the date of this Agreement.   
  
4. Employee Benefits. Employee shall be entitled to participate in any Company-sponsored employee benefit plans on substantially the same terms as other similarly situated employees of Company. Employee shall also be entitled to such other fringe benefits as may be offered from time to time to other similarly situated executive employees of Company, subject to the terms and conditions applicable to such fringe benefits. If Employee elects COBRA coverage after termination of his employment with Company, Company shall pay the premium for Employee’s COBRA coverage during any period in which Employee is receiving severance payments under this Agreement; provided, however that Employee’s severance payments will be reduced by an aggregate amount equal to the amount which Employee was responsible to pay on a monthly basis for such insurance coverage under the Company’s plan immediately prior to termination multiplied by the total number of months of severance the Employee is to receive.

5. Paid Time Off. Employee shall be entitled to a prorated portion of four weeks paid time off for the remainder of 2007. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, Employee shall be entitled to paid time off consistent with similarly situated employees of Company as set forth in Company’s Employee Handbook.

6. Expenses. Company shall pay or reimburse Employee, in accordance with Company’s reimbursement policy, for any expenses reasonably incurred by Employee in furtherance of Employee’s duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable traveling, meals and hotel accommodations, upon submission by Employee of vouchers or itemized lists prepared in compliance with such rules and policies as Company may from time to time adopt and as may be required in order to permit such payments as proper deductions to Company under the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations adopted now or hereafter in effect.

7. Termination. Employee’s employment with Company may be terminated prior to the end of the Employment Term upon the occurrence of any one of following events:

(a)

Death. Immediately upon the death of Employee. In such event, Company shall pay Employee severance in an amount equal to one (1) times Employee’s then-current Base Salary to be paid over a one-year period in regular periodic installments and in accordance with Company’s then-current payroll practices.  
  
(b)

Disability. Employee’s physical or mental disability (as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act), which prevents Employee from performing the essential functions of Employee’s duties, with or without reasonable accommodation, for a continuous period of 90 days or for a period of 120 days in any six month period.  
  
(c)

Voluntary Termination. Voluntary termination of this employment by Employee upon giving Company at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice. In such event, Company shall pay Employee severance in an amount equal to one (1) times Employee’s then-current Base Salary to be paid over a one-year period in regular periodic installments and in accordance with Company’s then-current payroll practices. Severance payments provided under this Section 7(c) shall be reduced by the amount earned by Employee in any other employment during the severance period.

Upon notice of termination of employment pursuant to paragraph 7(c) or 7(d), Company shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to immediately relieve Employee of Employee’s duties pursuant to this Agreement but to continue paying Employee’s Base Salary through the remainder of the notice period. If Employee is not relieved of Employee’s regular duties through this notice period, Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee shall continue to perform Employee’s duties in a professional and ethical manner. 

Upon termination of Employee’s employment for any reason, Employee acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically provided herein, Employee is not entitled to any other compensation or benefits following the effective date of termination.
