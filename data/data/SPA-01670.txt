EXHIBIT 10.57

  




  


This Stock Purchase Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of February 12, 2008, by and among Rudolf Gunnerman and Doris Gunnerman (“Gunnerman”), and the entities identified on the signature pages hereto, as buyers (each a “Buyer” and collectively “Buyers”).

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, Gunnerman, Borrower and Buyer agree as follows:

1. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms, conditions and representations in this Agreement, Buyers agree to purchase from Gunnerman and Gunnerman agrees to sell to Buyers in the amounts indicated on the signature pages hereto (each a “Proportionate Amount”), all right, title and interest of Gunnerman in and to 2,000,000 shares of $.001 par value common stock (“Common Stock”) of Sulphco, Inc. (the “Company”) (“Purchased Stock”) for the purchase price (“Purchase Price”) described below.

  


2. Consideration and Payment of Purchase Price.

  


(a) The Purchase Price of 750,000 shares of Common Stock shall be $4.00 per share of Common Stock and be payable on the initial closing date (“Initial Closing Date”). On or prior to the Initial Closing Date, Gunnerman will deliver all of the Purchased Stock to Grushko & Mittman, P.C. as Escrow Agent, which will be held and released pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement among Gunnerman, Buyers and the Escrow Agent relating to the Purchased Stock. Seven hundred and fifty thousand shares of Purchased Stock will be delivered to the Escrow Agent in the Buyer’s names in their Proportionate Amounts or in Gunnerman’s name with two medallion signature guaranteed stock powers endorsed in blank. If such Purchased Stock is delivered in Gunnerman’s name, the Escrow Agent is instructed to arrange for the Company’s transfer agent to reissue the Purchased Stock in each Buyer’s Proportionate Amounts. On or prior to the Initial Closing Date, each Buyer will deliver its Proportionate Amount of $3,000,000 to the Escrow Agent. On the Initial Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will release up to $3,000,000 to Gunnerman and up to 750,000 shares of Purchased Stock to the Buyers registered in each Buyer’s name, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The date such funds and shares are actually released is the Initial Closing Date.

  


(b) The Purchase Price of 1,250,000 shares of Purchased Stock shall be determined as follows: one-thirtieth (1/30th) of 1,250,000 shares of Purchased Stock shall be valued each trading day for the thirty consecutive trading days commencing on the fiftieth trading after the Initial Closing Date (“Pricing Period”) at ninety percent (90%) of the daily volume weighted average price as reported by Bloomberg LP for the principal trading market for the Common Stock (“VWAP”), but not less than $2.75 nor more than $5.50 per share of Purchased Stock. Not later than five trading days after the thirtieth trading day of the Pricing Period (the actual date such notice is given being the “Payment Notice Date”), Grushko & Mittman, P.C. (the “Escrow Agent”) will notify Gunnerman and Buyers of the Purchase Price of the Purchased Stock priced during the Pricing Period. Not later than five trading days after the Payment Notice Date, each Buyer shall deliver to Grushko & Mittman, P.C., pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, its Proportionate Amount of the aggregate Purchase Price for the 1,250,000 shares of Purchased Stock to be priced during the Pricing Period. Thereafter, such Purchased Stock to be purchased by each Buyer will be released to each Buyer and the Purchase Price for such 1,250,000 shares of Purchased Stock will be released to Gunnerman pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The date of such mutual release is the Second Closing Date.

* * *

3. Delivery of Purchased Stock by Gunnerman. Not later than five days after the date of this Agreement, Gunnerman shall deliver the Purchased Stock referred to in Section 2(b) above, to the Escrow Agent issued in the names of the Buyers. Gunnerman will deliver two share certificates for each Buyer, with each such certificate representing one-half of the Proportionate Amount of each such Buyer’s Purchased Stock. In the alternative, Gunnerman will deliver one or more share certificates to the Escrow Agent representing 1,250,000 shares of Purchased Stock together with medallion signature guaranteed stock powers endorsed in blank. The Escrow Agent is instructed, prior to such release and prior to the Second Closing Date, to cause the Company’s transfer agent to reissue such certificates in the names of the Buyers in their respective Proportionate Amounts.

  


4. Purchase and Sale.

  


(a) Effective upon the date of this Agreement (“Closing Date”), and subject to and conditioned upon the terms, covenants, limitations, and conditions contained herein, Gunnerman hereby sells, transfers, and assigns to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases and accepts from Gunnerman, in each case on and as of the Closing Date, all of Gunnerman’s right, title and interest, in, to, and under each such Buyer’s Proportionate Share of the Purchased Stock.

(b) If Gunnerman receives any dividend or other payments from the Company with respect to the Purchased Stock after the Closing Date, Gunnerman will forward to each Buyer, such Buyer’s Allocated Portion of such dividends or other payments. 

5. Election Not to Purchase. In the event the VWAP for any of the last five trading days of the Pricing Period is less than $7.00 per share of Common Stock or the trading volume reported by Bloomberg LP for the principal trading market for the Common Stock is less than 1,000,000 shares for any such trading day, then each Buyer for himself by written notice to Gunnerman and the Escrow Agent not later than the Payment Notice Date may elect to not purchase the portion of the Purchased Stock to be priced during the Pricing Period.

6. Buyer’s Obligations. In connection with the sale and transfer of the Purchased Stock, each Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Agent and Gunnerman such Buyer’s Proportionate Amount of the Purchase Price and an executed copy of this Agreement.
