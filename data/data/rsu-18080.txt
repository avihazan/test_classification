2\. Employment with the Company. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Performance Shares granted hereunder are granted on the condition that the Participant remains an Employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries from the Grant Date through (and including) the end of the Performance Period. This Award of Performance Shares shall not confer any right to the Participant (or any other Participant) to be granted future Performance Shares or other Awards under the Plan. 

3\. Committee Determination. This Award of Performance Shares represents an agreement by the Company to deliver Shares of the Company to the Participant in the future, pursuant to the terms hereof. The Award of Performance Shares will become payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan based on the achievement of performance goals over the Performance Period. Attainment of the performance goals shall be determined and certified by the Committee in writing within sixty (60) days following the end of the Performance Period. 

4\. Performance Award. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the Company hereby grants the Participant an Award of Performance Shares in accordance with the following performance measures and performance goals:

(a) Two Performance Periods. The number of Performance Shares the Participant will receive in connection with this Award will be based on the Company’s performance during two (2) periods. The initial performance period for the Participant’s Performance Shares (the “Initial Performance Period”) will begin on January 1, 2015 and end on December 31, 2016 (two years). The secondary performance period for the Participant’s Performance Shares (the “Secondary Performance Period”) will begin on January 1, 2015 and end on December 31, 2017 (three years). The Initial Performance Period and the Secondary Performance Period are collectively referred to as the “Performance Period.”

(1)

EPS Performance Measure for Initial Performance Period. The Award shall be further adjusted after the end of the Initial Performance Period based on the Company’s compounded annual growth EPS during the Initial Performance Period, as set forth in the table attached as Exhibit A hereto.   
  
\- 3 -

* * *

(2)

rTSR Performance Measure for Secondary Performance Period. The Award will be further adjusted in accordance with Exhibit B hereto after the end of the Secondary Performance Period based on the Company’s rTSR relative to its Peer Group (the list of which is attached as Exhibit C hereto).  
  
After the end of the Secondary Performance Period, the Committee will certify a percentage adjustment in accordance with Exhibit B, and the Participant will receive a final number of Performance Shares. 

The levels of achievement of performance range are from the threshold level of achievement to the maximum level of achievement, as indicated on Exhibits A and B. For avoidance of doubt, there will not be an Award payout if the EPS threshold level of performance is not attained for the Initial Performance Period. If the threshold level of achievement is attained for the Performance Period, the Award will payout in accordance with the percentages set forth in Exhibits A and B. 

(b) Partial Performance Period; Separation from Service. 

(1)

Death or Disability. If the Participant ceases to be a Participant in the Plan before the end of the Performance Period due to the Participant’s Termination of Employment as a result of death or Disability, then the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiaries shall receive, within thirty (30) days after the date of such death or Disability, fully vested Performance Shares that the Participant would have been issued pursuant to the Award based on the formula set forth in Section 4(b)(4)(i) and (ii) below, with the death or Disability being the qualifying event and the date of death or Disability shall be substituted for the date of the Change of Control, and with rTSR calculated as of the last day of the month in which such Termination of Employment occurs.  
  
(2)

Retirement: If Termination of Employment of the Participant with the Company is by reason of Retirement, the portion of the Performance Shares that shall vest shall be a prorated number of Performance Shares. Such prorated Award shall be equal to the value of the Award at the end of the Performance Period based on the actual performance during the Performance Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (including partial months) that the Participant was actively employed during the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the thirty-six (36) total number of months in the Performance Period.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Retirement, (i) if the Retirement is not the result of the Company’s Termination of Employment for Cause, and (ii) no severance compensation is payable by the Company to the Participant as a result of such Retirement, then pursuant to Section 17.4 of the Plan, the Committee or its delegatee may approve the vesting of the Performance Shares for an additional twelve (12) months such that the Performance Shares that would have vested within the twelve (12) month period following Retirement would vest in full based on actual performance during the Performance Period.   
  
(3)

Termination without Cause; Termination for Good Reason. If the Participant’s Termination of Employment is by reason of (i) termination by the Company without Cause or (ii) termination by the Participant for Good Reason, the Performance Shares shall vest upon the date of the Participant’s Termination of Employment. Such Award shall be equal to the value of the Award at the end of the Performance Period based on the actual performance during the Performance Period. As used in this Section 4(b)(3), “Good Reason” has the meaning ascribed to it for Termination of Employment unrelated to a Change of Control in an employment or severance agreement or letter between the Participant and the Company.  
  
(4)

Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control at any time during the Performance Period and the Participant’s Termination of Employment by the Company without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason during the period of twenty-four (24) months following a Change of Control, the Performance Period shall be terminated upon such date of Termination of Employment and the Participant shall, within thirty (30) days following such date of Termination of Employment, receive fully vested Performance Shares, calculated based on (i) attainment of the EPS target performance level, and (ii) actual rTSR performance, with each of (i) and (ii) calculated up until the date of such Termination of Employment. As used in this Section 4(b)(4), the terms “Cause”, “Change of Control”, and “Good Reason” shall have the meanings set forth in the Participant’s December 12, 2008 Restated Severance Protection Agreement.

(5)

Termination for Any other Reason; Forfeiture of Award. If the Participant terminates employment other than for Good Reason, and this Award has not previously vested pursuant to Section 4(b)(4), this Award shall be forfeited in its entirety immediately upon such termination, and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to this Award. The Committee (or its delegatee, to the extent permitted under the Plan) shall have sole discretion to determine if a Participant’s rights have terminated pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the authority to determine the basis for the Participant’s Termination of Employment. The Participant expressly acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the termination of the Participant’s employment shall result in forfeiture of the Award and any underlying payout to the extent the Award has not vested as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment date.  
  
5\. Vesting of Award. Subject to the terms of the Plan and the Agreement, the Award, to the extent earned in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof, will be fully vested following the expiration of the Secondary Performance Period. The Committee has sole authority to determine whether and to what degree the Award has vested and is payable and to interpret the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. 

6\. Timing of Payout. Payout of all vested Performance Shares shall occur as soon as administratively feasible following the end of the Secondary Performance Period, but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days after such vesting date, provided that, if such seventy-five (75) day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, the Participant may not choose in which calendar year payment will be made. 

7\. Participant Not a Shareholder. This Award does not represent actual Shares of the Company and the Participant is not, and will not become, by virtue of this Award, a shareholder of the Company until such time as the Company delivers Shares to the Participant pursuant to Section 6 hereof. The Participant may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise alienate or hypothecate his or her rights under this Award and any attempt to do so shall result in immediate forfeiture of this Award. 

8\. Recapitalization. In the event of any change in the capitalization of the Company such as a stock split or a corporate transaction such as any reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities, stock dividend, liquidation, dissolution, or otherwise, the number and class of Performance Shares subject to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee in the manner set forth in Section 4.4 of the Plan to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights. 

9\. Beneficiary Designation. The Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Agreement is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Director of Human Resources of the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant’s death shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. 

10\. Continuation of Employment. This Agreement shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continue employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor shall this Agreement interfere in any way with the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ right to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time. The Participant’s employment shall continue to be on an “at-will” basis. 

11\. Award Adjustments. Subject to Section 12(b) and to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall have authority to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Award in, recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the financial statements of the Company, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, if the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations; provided, however, that if the Participant is a Covered Employee, such adjustments may only be made if the effect thereof is to reduce the value and payout of the Award.
