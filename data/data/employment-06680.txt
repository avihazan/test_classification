(i) Former Employer Indemnity. In the event that any action or proceeding is threatened or commenced against Executive by his former employer (the “Former Employer”) relating to the Executive’s employment with the Company as contemplated by this Agreement, whether before or after Executive begins employment with the Company, the Company will indemnify Executive and hold him harmless for any damages, costs, liabilities, judgments, interest and settlement to the fullest extent permitted by its by-laws and applicable law (the “Damages”), provided, however, that the Company will not have an obligation to defend and/or indemnify the Executive if the Damages arose out of Executive’s willful malfeasance (which term shall include any willful breach by the Executive of any legal, fiduciary or regulatory duty of confidence or other duty of fidelity owed by the Executive to the Former Employer or a failure by the Executive to act in accordance with a business strategy agreed by the Company), gross misconduct, gross negligence, fraudulent conduct or illegal conduct.

Any expense reimbursements shall be made promptly, but in any event on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs the related expense. Any reimbursement in one calendar year shall not affect the amount that may be reimbursed in any other calendar year and a reimbursement (or right thereto) may not be exchanged or liquidated for another benefit or payment. 

7\. Termination of Employment. 

(a) Death or Disability. The Term of Employment shall terminate upon the Executive’s death. The Company shall be entitled to terminate the Executive’s employment and, accordingly, the Term of Employment, because of the Executive’s Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have a Disability if the Executive is entitled to long-term disability benefits under the Company’s long-term disability plan or policy, as the case may be, as in effect on the Date of Termination (as that term is defined in subparagraph 7(c)(ii) below) or if no plan or policy is maintained and the Executive is unable to perform his duty hereunder for 180 consecutive days. 

(b) By the Company. 

(i) The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment and the Term of Employment, without Cause by delivering to the Executive written Notice of Termination (as that term is defined in subparagraph 7(d)(i) below), or for Cause by delivering to the Executive a written Notice of Termination. 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means: (A) the Executive’s willful misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company or any of its affiliates; (B) the Executive’s intentional failure to act subject to and in accordance with any proper and lawful specific material direction of the Co-CEO or his designee or the Board of Directors of the Company which breach is not promptly cured by the Executive after written notice of such breach; (C) the Executive’s having been convicted of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony under the laws of the United States or any State; (D) the Executive’s violation of any applicable federal or state law governing the Company’s business or of any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by any regulatory body, the violation of which shall either disqualify the Executive from employment or association with the Company as an executive or have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business; provided, however, that any such violation shall not constitute “cause” if it results from action taken by the Executive in accordance with instructions from the Co-CEO or his designee or the Board of Directors of the Company or upon the advice of internal or outside counsel to the Company; or (E) the intentional breach by the Executive of any written covenant or agreement with the Company or any of their affiliates not to disclose any information pertaining to the Company or any of its affiliates or not to compete or otherwise interfere with the Company or any of its affiliates.

(c) By Executive for Good Reason.

Any occurrence of Good Reason shall be deemed waived by the Executive unless the Executive provides written notice of the event giving rise to Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such event. 

(d) By Consolidation or Reorganization; Change in Control.

(i) If the employment of the Executive hereunder shall be terminated solely by reason of the liquidation of any affiliate for the purposes of consolidation or reorganization or as part of any arrangement for the consolidation of the undertaking of such affiliate not involving liquidation (in each case, other than a “Change in Control”, as defined below) and the Executive shall be offered employment with the consolidated or reorganized company on the same terms as the terms of this Agreement, the Executive shall have no claim against the Company or any affiliate in respect of the termination of his employment by the Company. 

(ii) If the employment of the Executive hereunder shall be terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason within the six-month period prior to a Change in Control or within the two-year period after a Change in Control, in addition to the benefits provided in Section 8(a), the Executive shall be entitled to the additional following benefits: other than share options and other equity-based awards granted prior to the date of this Agreement, which shall vest and be exercisable in accordance with the terms of their grant agreements, all share options and other equity-based awards shall immediately vest and remain exercisable for the remainder of their terms; 

For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall have the same meaning as under the Aspen Insurance Holdings 2003 Share Incentive Plan as in effect as of the date hereof. 

(e) Termination Procedures. 

(i) Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of the Executive’s employment (other than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with the notice provisions contained in subparagraph 14(b) hereof.

(ii) Date of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement, “Date of Termination” shall mean the date specified in the Notice of Termination or the date of the Executive’s death so long as such date constitutes a “separation from service” as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any related regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 409A”); provided, however, that the date of termination in case of a termination by the Executive for Good Reason may not be earlier than 90 days after the receipt of the Notice of Termination by the Company. 

(iii) No Waiver. The failure to set forth any fact or circumstance in a Notice of Termination shall not constitute a waiver of the right to assert such fact or circumstance in an attempt to enforce any right under or provision of this Agreement. 

8\. Obligations of the Company upon Termination. 

(a) Post-Employment Benefits. If the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death or Disability or by the Executive for Good Reason after the requisite notice and failure of the Company to cure the written grounds underlying the “Good Reason”, 

(i) the Company shall pay or provide to the Executive in cash, no later than twenty (20) business days after the normal payment date for each, (a) any portion of the Executive’s earned but unpaid Annual Base Salary to the date of termination, (b) any earned but unpaid prior year Annual Bonus; (c) any other earned but unpaid equity and/or incentive awards, (d) a payment reflecting accrued but unused vacation days (subject to the limitation in subparagraph 4(d)), and (e) any unreimbursed business expenses subject to paragraph 6 (collectively the “Accrued Obligations”);

(20) business days after the normal payment date for each the following amounts the Accrued Obligations as defined in clause 8(a)(i) above. 

(c) Termination due to death or Disability. If the Executive’s employment is terminated due to death or Disability, the Company shall pay to the Executive (or to the Executive’s estate or personal representative, in the case of the Executive’s death) in cash (i) on the normal payment date for each Accrued Obligation (as defined in clause 8(a)(i) above) and (ii) on the normal payment date for a prorated annual bonus based on the actual annual bonus earned for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, prorated based on the fraction of the year the Executive was employed.

After making such payment(s), the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement. 

(d) Six-Month Delay. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A on the Date of Termination and the right to any payment as a result of the Executive’s separation from service provides for the “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A, then all such payments (other than payments qualifying as a short-term deferral under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(4), or treated as not providing for a deferral of compensation under the separation pay provisions of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)) shall not be made or commence during the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the date that is six months following the Date of Termination or, if earlier, on the date of the Executive’s death, if the earlier making of such payment would result in tax penalties being imposed on the Executive under Section 409A. The amount of any payment that would otherwise be paid to the Executive during this period shall instead be paid to the Executive on the first business day following the date that is six months following the Date of Termination or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death. 

9\. Release. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company will require that, prior to payment of any amount or provision of any benefit under paragraph 8 of this Agreement (other than an Accrued Obligation or due to the Executive’s death), the Executive shall within sixty (60) days following the Date of Termination have executed with all periods of revocation expired a complete release of the Company and their affiliates and related parties in such form as is reasonably required by the Company. 

10\. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies for which the Executive may qualify (other than severance policies). Vested benefits and other amounts that the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any other plan, program, policy, or practice of, or any contract or agreement with, the Company or any of its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with the terms of each such plan, program, policy, practice, contract, or agreement, as the case may be, except as expressly modified by this Agreement.

11\. Non-Competition; Confidential Information; and Non-Solicitation. 

(a) Non-Competition. During the Term of Employment and for a period of one year following the termination of the Executive’s employment if he is entitled to severance payments pursuant to subparagraph 8(a), the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, as a shareholder, officer, director, partner, consultant, employee or otherwise, engage in any business or enterprise which is “in competition” with the Company, its affiliates, or their successors or assigns (such entities collectively referred to hereinafter in this paragraph 11 as the “Company”); provided, however, that the Executive’s ownership of less than five percent of the issued and outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded company shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute such competition. A business or enterprise is deemed to be “in competition” if it is engaged, in any of the geographical regions in which the Company conducts the casualty reinsurance underwriting business on the Date of Termination or any other business which the Executive is supervising. 

(b) Confidential Information. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets, methods, know-how or data relating to the Company and their businesses or acquisition prospects (including the compensation and other terms of employment of their employees) that the Executive obtained or obtains during the Executive’s employment by the Company and that is not and does not become generally known to the public (other than as a result of the Executive’s violation of this paragraph 11) (“Confidential Information”). Except as may be required and appropriate in connection with carrying out his duties under this Agreement, the Executive shall not communicate, divulge, or disseminate any material Confidential Information at any time during or after the Executive’s employment with the Company, except with the prior written consent of the Company or as otherwise required by law or legal process; provided, however, that if so required, the Executive will provide the Company with reasonable notice to contest such disclosure. 

(c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. The Executive recognizes that he may possess confidential information about other employees of the Company relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with suppliers to and customers of the Company. The Executive recognizes that the information he will possess about these other employees may not be generally known, may be of substantial value to the Company in developing its respective businesses and in securing and retaining customers, and may be acquired by him because of his business position with the Company. The Executive agrees that, for a period of one year following the termination of the Executive’s employment if he is entitled to severance payments pursuant to subparagraph 8(a), he will not, directly or indirectly, initiate any action to solicit or recruit or hire anyone who is then an employee of the Company for the purpose of being employed by him or by any business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity on whose behalf he is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that he will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of the Company to any other person except within the scope of the Executive’s duties hereunder. 

(d) Non-Interference with Customers. The Executive agrees that, for a period of one year following the termination of the Executive’s employment if he is entitled to 

9

##### 

severance payments pursuant to subparagraph 8(a), he will not interfere with any business relationship between the Company and any of its customers. 

(e) Remedies; Severability. 

(i) The Executive acknowledges that his skills and position in the insurance industry are unique and if the Executive shall breach or threaten to breach any provision of subparagraphs 11(a) through (d), the damages to the Company may be substantial, although difficult to ascertain, and money damages will not afford the Company an adequate remedy. Therefore, if the provisions of subparagraphs 11(a) through (d) are violated, in whole or in part, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief (without having to post any bond), without prejudice to other remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. 

(ii) If any term or provision of this paragraph 11, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this paragraph 11, or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this paragraph 11 shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Moreover, if a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision hereof to be too broad in time, scope, or area, it is expressly agreed that such provision shall be reformed to the maximum degree that would not render it unenforceable. 

12\. Assignment. This is a personal services agreement and the Executive may not assign this Agreement to any third party. The Company may assign this Agreement and the benefits hereunder without the consent of the Executive, without being relieved of any liability hereunder, to one of its direct or indirect “affiliates” or “associates” as those terms are defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company may assign this Agreement and the benefits hereunder to any entity (corporate or other) into which the Company or the business of the Company may be merged, consolidated or transferred but nothing contained herein shall release the Company of any of its obligations hereunder. 

13\. Arbitration. Except for matters covered under paragraph 11, in the event of any dispute or difference between the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the enforcement of rights hereunder, either the Executive or the Company may, by written notice to the other, require such dispute or difference to be submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if they cannot agree on an arbitrator or arbitrators within 30 days after the date arbitration is required by either party, then the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) upon the application of the Executive or the Company. The determination reached in such arbitration shall be final and binding on both parties without any right of appeal or further dispute. Execution of the determination by such arbitrator may be sought in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall not be bound by judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of evidence and shall interpret this Agreement as an honorable engagement and not merely as a legal obligation. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any such arbitration shall take place in Stamford, Connecticut.
