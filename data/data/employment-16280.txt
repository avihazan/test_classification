B. “Confidential Information” means information, to the extent it is not a Trade Secret, which is possessed by or developed for the Company or any of its subsidiaries and which relates to the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ existing or potential business or technology, which information is generally not known to the public and which information the Company or any of its subsidiaries seeks to protect from disclosure to its existing or potential competitors or others, including, without limitation, for example: business plans, strategies, existing or proposed bids, costs, technical developments, clients, existing or proposed research projects, financial or business projections, investments, marketing plans, negotiation strategies, training information and materials, information generated for client engagements and information stored or developed for use in or with computers. Confidential Information also includes information received by the Company or any of its subsidiaries from others which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has an obligation to treat as confidential. 

ii. Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. Except as required in the conduct of the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ business or as expressly authorized in writing on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Employee shall not use or disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information during the period of her employment with the Company. In addition, following the termination for any reason of Employee’s employment with the Company, Employee shall not use or disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information. This prohibition also does not prohibit Employee’s use of general skills and know-how acquired during and prior to employment by the Company, as long as such use does not involve the use or disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets. 

iii. Trade Secrets. During Employee’s employment by the Company, Employee shall do what is reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized misappropriation or disclosure and threatened misappropriation or disclosure of the Company or any of its subsidiaries’ Trade Secrets and, after termination of employment, Employee shall not use or disclose the Company or any of its subsidiaries’ Trade Secrets as long as they remain, without misappropriation, Trade Secrets. 

iv. Exceptions. The provisions of paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above will not be deemed to prohibit any disclosure that is required by law or court order, provided that Employee has not intentionally taken actions to trigger such required disclosure and, so long as not prohibited by any applicable law or regulation, the Company is given reasonable prior notice and an opportunity to contest or minimize such disclosure. 

b. Non-Competition. 

i. During Employment. During Employee’s employment hereunder, Employee shall not engage, directly or indirectly, as an employee, officer, director, partner, manager, consultant, agent, owner or in any other capacity, in any competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and agrees not to solicit any Company or any of its subsidiaries business contact, including but not limited to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries’ customers, clients, vendors, employees, and independent contractors.

ii. Subsequent to Employment. For a period of: (i) one year following the termination of Employee’s employment for any reason or without reason, Employee shall not in any capacity, whether in the capacity as an employee, officer, director, partner, manager, consultant, agent or owner, directly or indirectly advise, manage, render or perform services to or for any person or entity which is engaged in a business competitive to that of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and agrees not to solicit any Company or any of its subsidiaries business contacts, including but not limited to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries’ customers, clients, vendors, employees, and independent contractors. 

c. Non-solicitation.

The Company shall have the option to withhold the Employee’s final paycheck until all documents are returned. 

e. No Conflicts. To the extent that they exist, Employee will not disclose to the Company or any of its subsidiaries any of Employee’s previous employer’s confidential information or trade secrets. Further, Employee represents and warrants that Employee has not previously assumed any obligations inconsistent with those of this Agreement and that employment by the Company does not conflict with any prior obligations to third parties. In addition, Employee and the Company agree that it is important for any prospective employer to be aware of this Agreement, so that disputes concerning this Agreement can be avoided in the future. Therefore, Employee agrees that, following termination of employment with the Company, the Company or any of its subsidiaries may forward a copy of this Agreement (and any related Exhibits hereto) to any future prospective or actual employer, and Employee releases the Company or any of its subsidiaries from any claimed liability or damage caused to Employee by virtue of the Company’s act in making that prospective or actual employer aware of this Agreement (and any related Exhibits hereto). 

f. Agreement on Fairness. Employee acknowledges that: (i) this Agreement has been specifically bargained between the parties and reviewed by Employee; (ii) Employee has had an opportunity to obtain legal counsel to review this Agreement; and (iii) the covenants made by and duties imposed upon Employee hereby are fair, reasonable and minimally necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, and such covenants and duties will not place an undue burden upon Employee’s livelihood in the event of termination of Employee’s employment by the Company and the strict enforcement of the covenants contained herein. 

g. Equitable Relief and Remedies. Employee acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement will cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall in any such event be entitled to seek injunctive and other forms of equitable relief to prevent such breach and the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other, the prevailing party’s costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with enforcing this Agreement, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law, in equity or by statute.

Employee hereby assigns to the Company any rights the Employee may have or acquire in any and all Intellectual Property and agrees that any and all Intellectual Property shall be the sole property of the Company and its assigns, and the Company and its assigns shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights and other rights in connection therewith.

1\. To apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and 

2\. To defend, at the Company’s expense, any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection. 

e. Designation of Attorney-in-Fact.

Employee’s obligation to assist the Company in obtaining and enforcing patents and copyrights for Intellectual Property in any and all countries shall continue beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement, but the Company shall compensate the Employee at a reasonable and customary rate after such termination for time actually spent by the Employee at the Company’s request on such assistance. 

f. Work for Hire. Employee acknowledges that all original works of authorship which are made by her (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which are protectable by copyright are being created at the instance of the Company and are “works for hire”, as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act (17 USC Section 101). If such laws are inapplicable or in the event that such works, or any part thereof, are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a work made for hire under the United States copyright laws, this Agreement shall operate granting to Company an irrevocable right, title and interest (including, without limitation all rights in and to the copyrights throughout the world, including the right to prepare derivative works and the right to all renewals and extensions) in the Works in perpetuity.
