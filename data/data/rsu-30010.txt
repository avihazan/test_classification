The Grantee named above has been awarded the number of restricted shares (the “Restricted Stock”) of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Virtual Radiologic Corporation (the “Company”) as indicated above. This Agreement outlines certain terms and conditions of the award. The Restricted Stock is granted under and will be governed by terms of the Virtual Radiologic Corporation Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. 

1\. Rights as Stockholder. From and after the Grant Date, the Grantee will have all rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock, including the right to vote shares of Restricted Stock, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 8.8 of the Plan regarding dividends payable in Shares having a record date during a Period of Restriction on any of the Restricted Stock. 

2\. Restrictions; Delivery. 

(a) Until the Restricted Stock granted hereunder vests and applicable Periods of Restriction lapse in accordance with Section 3 hereof, one or more stock certificates representing the unvested portion of the Restricted Stock will be issued in the Grantee’s name, but will be held in custody by the Company or an escrow agent (which may be a brokerage firm) appointed by the Company. Alternatively, the unvested portion of the Restricted Stock may be reflected in an electronic account, with appropriate stop transfer instructions. The Grantee will not be permitted to sell, transfer, assign, give, place in trust, or otherwise dispose of or pledge, grant a security interest in, or otherwise encumber unvested shares of Restricted Stock, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any such attempted disposition or encumbrance will be void and unenforceable against the Company, provided that the Grantee may assign or transfer unvested shares of Restricted Stock in any manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this award, upon the vesting of any shares of Restricted Stock and the lapse of any applicable Period of Restriction, the Company will deliver to the Grantee a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Restricted Stock which have so vested. Alternatively, the Company may elect to deliver vested shares of Restricted Stock electronically, and if applicable, Grantee may be required by the Company to establish an account with a brokerage firm selected by the Company as a condition to receiving such shares. 

3\. Vesting of Restricted Stock. The Restricted Stock will vest (and become non-forfeitable), and all Periods of Restriction shall lapse as follows [INSERT VESTING TERMS]. 

4\. Securities Act Registration. The Grantee is prohibited from selling vested shares of Restricted Stock other than pursuant to either (i) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), which registration statement has become
