FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTE

  


PROMISSORY NOTE

  


$100,000.00 Salt Lake County, Utah  November ___, 2012  
  
  


FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned Midwest Monitoring and Surveillance Inc. a Corporation of the State of Minnesota ( “Maker”), promises to pay to the order of SecureAlert, Inc., a Utah corporation (the “Payee”, which term shall include any subsequent holder hereof) at 150 West Civic Center Drive, Suite 100, Sandy, Utah 84070 or at such other place as Payee may designate in writing from time to time in legal tender of the United States of America, the principal sum of One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) without interest which shall become due and payable on the date below and in the following manner:

  


Principal and interest, if any, shall be due and payable on April 1, 2013 (the “Maturity Date”). Provided however that payment may be withheld, without interest, until confirmation is received that Gary Bengtson has been paid off for the original sale of Midwest to Secure Alert.

  


TIME IS OF THE ESSENSE of this Note.

  


Privilege is hereby reserved to prepay the principal balance payable under this Note in whole or in part without penalty. Prepayment in part shall not affect, vary or postpone the duty of the Maker to pay all obligations when due, and it shall not affect or impair the right of the Payee to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder.

  


Payee shall have the right to declare the amount of the total unpaid principal balance, immediately due and payable upon the failure of the Maker to pay any payment hereunder within ten (10) days after its due date; upon the bankruptcy of Maker; or upon the occurrence of any event of default, or failure to perform in accordance with any of the terms and conditions of this Note or relating thereto and such default or failure to perform continues after expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods. Upon exercise of this option by the Payee, the entire unpaid principal shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum until paid. Forbearance to exercise this right with respect to any failure or breach of the Maker shall not constitute a waiver of the right as to any subsequent failure or breach. Exercise of this right shall be without notice to the Maker, notice of such exercise being hereby expressly waived.

  


Maker covenants and agrees to pay all and costs, taxes, fees, and expenses of every kind and nature, including the Payee’s reasonable attorneys’ fees (including on appeal and in bankruptcy), incurred or expended at any time by the Payee in the collection of the loan evidenced hereby or otherwise incurred in protecting and preserving Payee’s right under this Note, or under any other instrument evidencing the indebtedness evidenced hereby.

  


* * *

Maker, for itself, legal representatives, successors, and assigns, respectively, hereby expressly waive presentment, demand for payment, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of non-payment, and diligence in collection, and consent that the time of all payments or any part thereof may be extended, rearranged, renewed or postponed by the Payee, and agrees that the Payee shall not be required first to institute any suit or to exhaust any of its remedies against the Maker or any other person or party liable hereunder in order to enforce payment of this Note.

  


This Note is to be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Minnesota.

  


All agreements between the Maker and the Payee are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of advancement of the proceeds hereof, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof, or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Payee of this Note for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be advanced hereunder exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under any law which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable.

  


AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR PAYEE TO MAKE THE LOAN EVIDENCED HEREBY, PAYEE AND MAKER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT EITHER MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROMISSORY NOTE, THE LOAN EVIDENCED HEREBY, ALL DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS EXECUTED OR CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN EVIDENCED HEREBY, AND ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY.

  


“MAKER”
