* * *

  


#### have such disputes resolved via trial before a judge and/or jury. Such disputes shall include, without limitation, claims for breach of contract or of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claims of discrimination, claims under any federal, state or local law or regulation now in existence or hereinafter enacted and as amended from time to time concerning in any way the subject of the Executive’s employment with the Company or its termination.

With respect to such disputes, they shall not be subject to arbitration; rather, they will be resolved pursuant to applicable law.

#### 

Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”), provided, however, that the arbitrator shall allow the discovery authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1282, et seq., or any other discovery required by applicable law in arbitration proceedings, including, but not limited to, discovery available under the applicable state and/or federal arbitration statutes.

Arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California or, if the Executive does not reside within 100 miles of Santa Clara County at the time the dispute arises, then the arbitration may take place in the largest metropolitan area within 50 miles of the Executive’s place of residence when the dispute arises.

During the course of the arbitration, the Executive and the Company will each bear equally the arbitrator’s fee and any other type of expense or cost of arbitration, unless applicable law requires otherwise, and each shall bear their own respective attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator will not have authority to award attorneys’ fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. In such case, the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys’ fees as required or permitted by the applicable statute or contract. If there is a dispute as to whether the Executive or the Company is the prevailing party in the arbitration, the arbitrator will decide this issue.

The arbitrator shall issue a written award that sets forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief authorized by law in connection with the asserted claims or disputes. The arbitrator’s award shall be subject to correction, confirmation, or vacation, as provided by applicable law setting forth the standard of judicial review of arbitration awards. Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

#### (h) No Assignment. This Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Executive hereunder are personal to the Executive and may not be transferred or assigned by the Executive at any time. The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that assumes the Company’s obligations hereunder in connection with any sale or transfer of all or a substantial portion of the Company’s assets to such entity.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC.

EMPLOYEE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

AND INVENTIONS AGREEMENT

In consideration of my employment or continued employment by ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. (the “Company”), and the compensation now and hereafter paid to me, I hereby agree as follows:

1. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. At all times during my employment and thereafter, I will hold in strictest confidence and will not disclose, use, lecture upon or publish any of the Company’s Proprietary Information (defined below), except as such disclosure, use or publication may be required in connection with my work for the Company, or unless an officer of the Company expressly authorizes such in writing. “Proprietary Information” shall mean any and all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge, data or information of the Company, its affiliated entities, customers and suppliers, including but not limited to information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, methods, developmental or experimental work, improvements, discoveries, inventions, ideas, source and object codes, data, programs, other works of authorship, and plans for research and development. During my employment by the Company I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets, if any, of any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality, and I will not bring onto the premises of the Company any unpublished documents or any property belonging to any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality unless consented to in writing by that former employer or person.

2. Assignment of Inventions.

2.1. Proprietary Rights. The term “Proprietary Rights” shall mean all trade secret, patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights throughout the world.

2.2. Inventions. The term “Inventions” shall mean all trade secrets, inventions, mask works, ideas, processes, formulas, source and object codes, data, programs, other works of authorship, know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments, designs and techniques.

2.3. Prior Inventions. I have set forth on Exhibit B (Previous Inventions) attached hereto a complete list of all Inventions that I have, alone or jointly with others, made prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company that I consider to be my property or the property of third parties and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (collectively referred to as “Prior Inventions”). If no such disclosure is attached, I represent that there are no Prior Inventions. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate a Prior Invention into a Company product, process or machine, the Company is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I agree that I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, Prior Inventions in any Company Inventions without the Company’s prior written consent.

2.4. Assignment of Inventions. Subject to Section 2.6 and except for those Inventions which I can prove qualify fully under the provisions of California Labor Code 2870 (as set forth in Exhibit A), I hereby assign and agree to assign in the future (when any such Inventions or Proprietary Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to the Company all my right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Proprietary Rights with respect thereto). I will, at the Company’s request, promptly execute a written assignment to the Company of any such Company Invention, and I will preserve any such Invention as part of the Proprietary Information of the Company (the “Company Inventions”).

2.5. Obligation to Keep Company Informed. I will promptly and fully disclose in writing to the Company all Inventions during my employment and for one (1) year after my employment, including any that may be covered by Section 2870. I agree to assist in every proper way and to execute those documents and take such acts as are reasonably requested by the Company to obtain,

* * *

  


sustain and from time to time enforce patents, copyrights and other rights and protections relating to Inventions in the United States or any other country.

2.6. Government or Third Party. I also agree to assign all my right, title and interest in and to any particular Company Invention to a third party, including without limitation the United States, as directed by the Company.

3. NO CONFLICTING OBLIGATION. I REPRESENT that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and as an employee of the Company does not and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence information acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company. I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith.

4. RETURN OF COMPANY DOCUMENTS. Upon termination of my employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, voluntarily or involuntarily, and at any earlier time the Company requests, I will deliver to the person designated by the Company all originals and copies of all documents and other property of the Company in my possession, under my control or to which I may have access. I will not reproduce or appropriate for my own use, or for the use of others, any property, Proprietary Information or Company Inventions.

5. LEGAL AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES. Because my services are personal and unique and because I may have access to and become acquainted with the Proprietary Information of the Company, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.

6. NOTICES. Any notices required or permitted hereunder shall be given to the appropriate party at the address specified below or at such other address as the party shall specify in writing. Such notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery to the appropriate address or if sent by certified or registered mail, three (3) days after the date of mailing.

7. EMPLOYMENT. I agree and understand that nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with my right or the Company’s right to terminate my employment at any time, with or without cause.

GENERAL PROVISIONS. This Agreement will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of California, as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment and the assignment of this Agreement by the Company to any successor in interest or other assignee. No waiver by the Company of any breach of this Agreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach. No waiver by the Company of any right under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other right. The obligations pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement shall apply to any time during which I was previously employed, or am in the future employed, by the Company as a consultant if no other agreement governs nondisclosure and assignment of inventions during such period. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between us. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.

LIMITED EXCLUSION NOTIFICATION

THIS IS TO NOTIFY you in accordance with Section 2872 of the California Labor Code that the foregoing Agreement between you and the Company does not require you to assign or offer to assign to the Company any invention that you developed entirely on your own time without using the Company’s equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:

1. Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the Company’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company;
