12.

Enforcement.  
  
(a)

The Bank and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the relationship between Executive and the Bank, the agreements referred to in Sections 10 and 11 (including without limitation their scope, duration and geographic extent) are fair and reasonably necessary for the protection of the Bank’s and Company’s confidential information, goodwill and other protectable interests. If a court of competent jurisdiction should decline to enforce any of those covenants and agreements, Executive and the Bank request the court to reform these provisions to restrict Executive’s use of confidential information and Executive’s ability to compete with the Bank and Company to the maximum extent, in time, scope of activities and geography, the court finds enforceable.  
  
(b)

Executive acknowledges the Bank and Company will suffer immediate and irreparable harm that will not be compensable by damages alone if Executive repudiates or breaches any of the provisions of Sections 10 or 11 or threatens or attempts to do so. For this reason, under these circumstances, the Bank, in addition to and without limitation of any other rights, remedies or damages available to it at law or in equity, will be entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions in order to prevent or restrain the breach, and the Bank will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting of this relief.  
  
13.

Covenants. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of adequate consideration for the covenants contained in Sections 10 or 11 and that the Bank is entitled to require him to comply with these Sections. These Sections will survive termination of this Agreement. Executive represents that if his employment is terminated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, Executive has experience and capabilities sufficient to enable Executive to obtain employment in areas which do not violate this Agreement and that the Bank’s enforcement of a remedy by way of injunction will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood.  
  
14.

Arbitration.  
  
(a)

Arbitration. At either party’s request, the parties must submit any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with, or relating to, this Agreement or any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, to arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules then in effect (or under any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties). A single arbitrator agreed on by the parties will conduct the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, each party must select one arbitrator and those two arbitrators will select a third arbitrator. This third arbitrator will hear the dispute. The arbitrator’s decision is final (except as otherwise specifically provided by law) and binds the parties, and either party may request any court having jurisdiction to enter a judgment and to enforce the arbitrator’s decision. The arbitrator will provide the parties with a written decision naming the substantially prevailing party in the action. This prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement from the other party for its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

* * *

  


(b)

Governing Law. All proceedings will be held at a place designated by the arbitrator in Flathead County, Montana. The arbitrator, in rendering a decision as to any state law claims, will apply Montana law.  
  
(c)

Exception to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, if Executive violates Section 10 or 11, the Bank will have the right to initiate the court proceedings described in Section 12(b), in lieu of an arbitration proceeding under this Section 14.  
  
15.

Miscellaneous Provisions.

(b)

Binding Effect. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Bank’s and Executive’s heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.  
  
(c)

Litigation Expenses. If either party successfully seeks to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to collect any amount claimed to be due under it, this party will be entitled to reimbursement from the other party for any and all of its out-of-pocket expenses and costs including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the enforcement or collection.  
  
(d)

Waiver. Any waiver by a party of its rights under this Agreement must be written and signed by the party waiving its rights. A party’s waiver of the other party’s breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of any other breach by the breaching party.  
  
(e)

Assignment. The services to be rendered by Executive under this Agreement are unique and personal. Accordingly, Executive may not assign any of his rights or duties under this Agreement.  
  
(f)

Amendment. This Agreement may be modified only through a written instrument signed by both parties and ratified by the Company.  
  
(g)

Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. The invalidity of any provision will not affect the validity of other provisions of this Agreement.

(h)

Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with Idaho law, except to the extent that certain regulatory matters may be governed by federal law. The parties must bring any legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement in Kootenai County, Idaho.
