EXHIBIT 99.2 

CMGI, INC. 



Granted Under 2000 Stock Incentive Plan 

AGREEMENT made as of the 23rd day of August, 2005 (the “Grant Date”), between CMGI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Joseph C. Lawler (the “Executive”). 

This restricted stock award is granted pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement between the Company and the Executive dated August 23, 2004 (the “Employment Agreement”). In consideration of the Executive entering into the Employment Agreement and entering into the CMGI, Inc. Non-Competition Agreement dated August 23, 2005, for past services rendered and other valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1\. Grant of Shares. 

The Company hereby grants to the Executive, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Company’s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), 449,685 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (“Common Stock”). The Executive agrees that the Shares shall be subject to forfeiture as set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement and the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. 

2\. Forfeiture. 

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 2, in the event that the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, prior August 23, 2010, all of the Unvested Shares (as defined below) shall be forfeited. 

“Unvested Shares” means the total number of Shares multiplied by the Applicable Percentage at the time the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company. The “Applicable Percentage” shall be (i) 100% during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending August 22, 2006, (ii) 80% during the 12-month period ending August 22, 2007, (iii) 60% during the 12-month period ending August 22, 2008, (iv) 40% during the 12-month period ending August 22, 2009, (v) 20% during the 12-month period ending on August 22, 2009, and (vi) zero after August 22, 2010\. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, in the event of a termination of employment which entitles the Executive to severance under paragraph 3(a) or 3(b) of the Executive Severance Agreement entered into between the Executive and the Company dated August 23, 2004 (the “Executive Severance Agreement”), the Executive shall vest and be entitled to receive free of all restrictions all or a portion of the Unvested Shares, as determined and provided for in paragraph 3 of such Executive Severance Agreement. To the extent that any of the Unvested Shares do not become vested pursuant to such paragraph 3, they shall be forfeited in accordance with paragraph (a) above. 

* * *

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent or subsidiary of the Company. 

3\. Restrictions on Transfer. 

The Executive shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively “transfer”) any Shares, or any interest therein, that would be Unvested Shares if the Executive were to cease to be employed by the Company at the time of the transfer, except that the Executive may transfer such Shares (i) to or for the benefit of any spouse, children, parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, grandchildren and any other relatives approved by the Board of Directors (collectively, “Approved Relatives”) or to a trust established solely for the benefit of the Executive and/or Approved Relatives, provided that such Shares shall remain subject to this Agreement (including without limitation the forfeiture provisions of Section 2 and the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 3) and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (ii) as part of the sale of all or substantially all of the shares of capital stock of the Company (including pursuant to a merger or consolidation), provided that, in accordance with the Plan, the securities or other property received by the Executive in connection with such transaction shall remain subject to this Agreement. 

4\. Escrow. 

The Executive shall, upon the execution of this Agreement, execute Joint Escrow Instructions in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. The Joint Escrow Instructions shall be delivered to the Assistant Secretary of the Company, as escrow agent thereunder. The Executive shall deliver to such escrow agent a stock assignment duly endorsed in blank, in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B, and hereby instructs the Company to deliver to such escrow agent, on behalf of the Executive, the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares issued hereunder. Such materials shall be held by such escrow agent pursuant to the terms of such Joint Escrow Instructions. 

5\. Restrictive Legends. 

All certificates representing Shares shall have affixed thereto a legend in substantially the following form, in addition to any other legends that may be required under federal or state securities laws: 

“The shares of stock represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions on transfer and a risk of forfeiture as set forth in a certain Restricted Stock Agreement between the corporation and the registered owner of these shares (or his or her predecessor in interest), and such Agreement is available for inspection without charge at the office of the Secretary of the corporation.” 

* * *

6\. Provisions of the Plan. 

(a) This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which has been furnished to the Executive. 

(b) As provided in the Plan, upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event (as defined in the Plan), all rights of the Company hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the Company’s successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Shares were converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Reorganization Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Shares under this Agreement. If, in connection with a Reorganization Event, a portion of the cash, securities and/or other property received upon the conversion or exchange of the Shares is to be placed into escrow to secure indemnification or similar obligations, the mix between the vested and unvested portion of such cash, securities and/or other property that is placed into escrow shall be the same as the mix between the vested and unvested portion of such cash, securities and/or other property that is not subject to escrow. 

7\. Withholding Taxes; Section 83(b) Election. 

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Executive any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the lapse or partial lapse of the risk of forfeiture. 

(b) The Executive has reviewed with the Executive’s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Executive is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Executive understands that the Executive (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Executive’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Executive understands that it may be beneficial in many circumstances to elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are granted rather than when and as the risk of forfeiture lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of grant. 

THE EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE EXECUTIVE’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY’S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF THE EXECUTIVE REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON THE EXECUTIVE’S BEHALF. 

* * *

8\. Miscellaneous. 

(a) No Rights to Employment. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the Shares pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or being granted shares hereunder). The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the vesting period, for any period, or at all. 

(b) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 

(c) Waiver. Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors of the Company. 

(d) Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Executive and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. 

(e) Notice. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery or five days after deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed, if to the Company to the attention of the General Counsel at its corporate headquarters, and, if to the Executive, at the last address on file with the Company, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 8(e). 

(f) Pronouns. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. 

(g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

(h) Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Executive. 

(i) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.
