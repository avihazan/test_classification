10.06 Severability.

A Gross Up Payment shall be made by the Company promptly after either the Company or the Company’s independent accountants determine that any payments and benefits called for under this Employment Agreement together with any other payments and benefits made available to Employee by the Company and any other person will result in Employee being subject to an excise tax under § 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which shall be referred to in this Section 11 as the “Code”) or such an excise tax is assessed against Employee as a result of any such payments and other benefits if Employee takes such action (other than waiving Employee’s right to any payments or benefits in excess of the payments or benefits which Employee has expressly agreed to waive under this Section 11) as the Company reasonably requests under the circumstances to mitigate

12\. Indemnification.

12.01 Company Obligations. The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless Employee, to the extent allowed by applicable law, against all liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, lawsuits, judgments, expenses and costs, including but not limited to the reasonable costs of investigation and attorney’s fees, incurred by the Employee as a result of any threat, demand, claim action or lawsuits, made, instituted or initiated against the Employee, which arises out of, results from or relates to this Agreement or any action taken by Employee in the course of performance of Employee’s duties hereunder, except for Employee’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

12.02 Notice and Defense of Claim. If any claim suit or other legal proceeding shall be commenced, or any claim or demand be asserted against the Employee and Employee desires indemnification pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall be notified to such effect with reasonable promptness and shall have the right to assume at its full cost and expense the entire control of any legal proceeding, subject to the right of the Employee to participate at his full cost and expense and with counsel of his choice in the defense, compromise or settlement thereof. The Employee shall cooperate fully in all respects with the Company in any such defense, compromise or settlement, including, without limitation, making available to the Company all pertinent information under the control of the Employee. The Company may compromise or settle any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand without Employee’s approval so long as the Company obtains for Employee’s benefit a release of liability with respect to such claim from the claimant and the Company assumes and agrees to pay any amounts due with respect to such settlement. In no event shall the Company be liable for any settlement entered into by the Employee without the Company’s prior written consent.

12.03 Survival. The provisions of this paragraph 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of four (4) years, unless Employee is terminated for Cause, in which event the provisions of this Section 12 shall not survive termination of this Agreement. 

13\. Dispute Resolution.

13.01 Agreement to Arbitrate. In consideration for his continued employment with the Company, and other consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, but subject to Section 6.07(b) above, Employee acknowledges and agrees that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to Employees employment, termination of employment, or this Agreement including, but not limited to, controversies and claims that are protected or covered by any federal, state, or local statute, regulation or common law, shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. This includes, but is not limited to, violations or alleged violations of any federal or state statute or common law (including, but not limited to, the laws of the United States or of any state, or the Constitution of the United States or of any state), or of any other law, statute, ordinance, including but not limited to, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and any other statute or common law. This provision shall not, however, preclude the Company from seeking equitable relief as provided in Section 10.06 of this Agreement. 

13.02 Procedure. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association: a single arbitrator who is experienced in employment law shall be selected under those Rules, and the arbitration shall be initiated in Atlanta, Georgia, unless the parties agree in writing to a different location or the Arbitrator directs the arbitration to be held at a different location. Except for filing fees, all costs of the arbitrator shall be allocated by the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In addition to that provided for in the Employment Arbitration Rules, the arbitrator has sole discretion to permit discovery consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the judicial interpretation of those rules upon request by any party; provided, however, it is the intent of the parties that the arbitrator limit the time and scope of any such discovery to the greatest extent practicable and provide a decision as rapidly as possible given the circumstances of the claims to be determined. The arbitrator also shall have the power and authority to grant injunctive relief for any violation of Sections 10.02 through and including 10.04 and the arbitrator’s order granting such relief may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The agreement to arbitrate any claim arising out of the employment relationship or termination of employment shall not apply to those claims which cannot be made subject to this provision by statute, regulation or common law. These include, but are not limited to, any claims relating to work related injuries and claims for unemployment benefits under applicable state laws. 

13.03 Rights of Parties. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to prevent the Company from asking a court of competent jurisdiction to enter appropriate equitable relief to enjoin any violation of this Agreement by Employee. The Company shall have the right to seek 

Employee’s Initials:

##### 

such relief in connection with or apart from the parties’ rights under this clause to arbitrate all disputes. With respect to disputes arising under this Agreement that are submitted to a court rather than an arbitrator, including actions to compel arbitration or for equitable relief in aid of arbitration, the parties agree that venue and jurisdiction are proper in any state or federal court lying within Atlanta, Georgia and specifically consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such court for the purpose of any proceedings contemplated by this paragraph. By entering into this Agreement the parties have waived any right which may exist for a trial by jury and have expressly agreed to resolve any disputes covered by this Agreement through the arbitration process described herein. 

14\. Employee Acknowledgment.

By signing this Agreement, Employee acknowledges that the Company has advised Employee of his right to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement; that he has the right to retain counsel of his own choosing concerning the agreement to arbitrate or any waiver of rights or claims; that he has read and fully understands the terms of this Agreement and/or has had the right to have it reviewed and approved by counsel of choice, with adequate opportunity and time for such review; and that he is fully aware of its contents and of its legal effect. Accordingly, this Agreement shall not be construed against any party on the grounds that the party drafted this Agreement. Instead, this Agreement shall be interpreted as though drafted equally by all parties. 

15\. Amendments.

This Agreement may not be altered, modified or amended except by a written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto. 

16\. Successors.

As used in this Agreement, the term the Company shall include any successors to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement. 

17\. Assignment.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of either party hereunder shall be assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party, except that the Company may without the consent of Employee assign its rights and delegate its duties hereunder to any successor to the business of the Company. In the event of the assignment by the Company of its rights and the delegation of its duties to a successor to the business of the Company and the assumption of such rights and obligations by such successor, the Company shall, effective upon such assumption, be relieved from any and all obligations whatsoever to Employee hereunder. 

18\. Waiver.

##### 

Waiver by any party hereto of any breach or default by any other party of any of the terms of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any other breach or default, whether similar to or different from the breach or default waived. 

19\. Severability.

In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected thereby. 

20\. Survival.
