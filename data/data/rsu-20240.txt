(b) No Fractional Shares. Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be cumulated.

(c) Minimum Exercise. No fewer than 100 shares may be purchased at any one time, unless the number purchased is the total number at the time exercisable under the Option.

2\. Method of Exercise of Option. The Option may be exercised by the Optionee’s delivery to the Company of a properly completed and executed exercise form as from time to time approved by the Committee stating the number of shares to be purchased pursuant to the Option and accompanied by payment in the full amount of the purchase price of the shares in one or a combination of the following methods:

4\. Optionee not a Shareholder. Neither the Optionee nor any other person entitled to exercise the Option shall have any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company as to any Common Shares until the issuance and delivery to him or her of the shares acquired upon exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as to a shareholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.
