TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PURCHASE OF SHARES

1\.  Authorization and Sale of the Shares; Registration. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company has authorized the sale of the Shares. The Shares have been registered on a Form S-3, File No. 333-111226 (the “Registration Statement”), which registration statement has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on January 5, 2004, has remained effective since such date and is effective on the date hereof. 

2\.  Agreement to Sell and Purchase the Shares; Subscription Date; Additional Agreements.

2.1  At the Closing (as defined in Section 3), the Company will sell to the Investors, and the Investors, severally and not jointly, will purchase from the Company, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the respective number of Shares set forth opposite each Investor’s name on Exhibit A hereto at the purchase price set forth on such Exhibit A. 

2.2  The Company may enter into this same or a similar form of Stock Purchase Agreement with certain other investors (the “Other Investors”) and may complete sales of Shares to them. (The Investors and the Other Investors are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “Investors,” and this Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreements executed by the Other Investors are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “Agreements.”) 

2.3  The Investors acknowledge that: (a) the Company has retained Leerink Swann & Company as placement agent (in its capacity as placement agent of the Shares, the “Placement Agent”); (b) the Company intends to pay the Placement Agent a fee in respect of the sale of Shares to the Investors; and (c) the offering of the Shares is not a firm commitment underwriting. 

2.4  (a) The Investors will have the right to appoint a member to the Company’s Board of Directors as of the Closing Date (“Investor Director”), which right shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date. So long as the Investors in the aggregate continue to own not less than 1,150,000 shares of Common Stock (appropriately adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and the like), and exercise their right within the 12 month period from the Closing Date, the Investor Director shall have a right to serve on the Board of Directors, subject to the same terms and conditions as the Company’s other Directors. The Investor Director may resign from the Board of Directors at any time without notice and may not be removed from the Board of Directors by the Company without “Cause” as defined in subsection (b) below. 

(b) For purposes of this Section 2.4, the following shall constitute “Cause”: (i) any action by the Investor Director constituting fraud or embezzlement in the course of his tenure on the Board of Directors, (ii) any conviction of the Investor Director of a felony which would materially and adversely interfere with the Investor Director’s ability to perform his or her duties as a member of the Board of Directors; (iii) continued gross neglect or willful refusal by the Investor Director to perform his or her duties hereunder for a period of ten (10) days following notice to the Investor Director of such inaction; or (iv) a material breach by the Investor Director of any other material obligations under this Agreement or the Company’s By-

laws if such breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof by the Company to the Investor Director. 

3\.  Delivery of the Shares at Closing. The completion of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the “Closing”) shall occur at the offices of Holme Roberts & Owen LLP, 1700 Lincoln Street, Suite 4100, Denver, Colorado 80203, at 10:00 o’clock A.M. E.S.T. on February 18, 2005 (the “Closing Date”), but in no event earlier than such date and time as American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) shall have received all of the executed Stock Purchase Agreements. The executed Stock Purchase Agreements and the purchase price transferred by the Investor (jointly the “Escrowed Property”) will be held by the Escrow Agent until the Closing is confirmed by the Company and Placement Agent, under the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement to be entered into on the Closing Date by and among the Company, the Placement Agent and the Escrow Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Escrow Agreement”). If the Closing does not occur, the funds will be returned to the Investor. All wires should be sent to the Escrow Agent, JP Morgan Chase, 55 Water Street, New York, NY 10041, ABA# 021 000 021, Account #323 213251, Attention: Henry Reinhold. At the Closing, upon written instruction of the Company and the Placement Agent, the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrowed Property (in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement) to the Company and the Company shall arrange delivery to the Investor one or more stock certificates representing the number of Shares set forth on the Signature Page hereto, each such certificate to be registered in the name of the Investor or, if so indicated on the Stock Certificate Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A, in the name of a nominee designated by the Investor. Such stock certificates shall be unlegended and free of any resale restrictions. 

The Company’s obligation to issue the Shares to the Investors shall be subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by the Company: (a) receipt by the Company of the purchase price for the Shares being purchased hereunder as set forth on Exhibit A hereto; and (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Investors and the fulfillment of those undertakings of the Investors to be fulfilled prior to the Closing. 

Each Investor’s obligation to purchase the Shares shall be subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by the Investor: (a) trading in the Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the Commission (except for any suspension of trading of limited duration agreed to by the Company, which suspension shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date); (b) no stop order suspending the effectively of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and (c) receipt of a satisfactory legal opinion from the Company’s legal counsel pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement. The Investor’s obligations are expressly not conditioned on the purchase by any or all of the other Investors, if any, of the Shares that they have agreed to purchase from the Company. 

4\.  Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Company. Except as otherwise described in the Registration Statement and the Company’s filings with the Commission since December 31, 2003 (the “Commission Documents”), in the Company’s press releases since December 31, 2003, and in the certain operational, managerial and other

4.1  Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and lawful authority to conduct its business as described in its Company Information. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or as proposed to be conducted in its Company Information, by it or the properties owned, leased or operated by it, makes such qualification or licensing necessary and where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would have a material adverse effect upon the business, properties or financial condition of the Company (“Material Adverse Effect”). 

4.2  Capitalization and Voting Rights. The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in its Commission Documents as of the date thereof; all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in the Company Information and except for shares reserved for issuance pursuant to employee and consultant benefit and option plans within the limits specified therein, there are no outstanding options, warrants, agreements, commitments, convertible securities, preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase any shares of capital stock of the Company nor are there any agreements, promises or commitments to issue any of the foregoing. Except as set forth in the Company’s SEC filings, in this Agreement and as otherwise required by law, there are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of the Shares pursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), By-laws or other governing documents or any agreement or other instruments to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound. 

4.3  Authorization; Enforceability. The Company has all corporate right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. All corporate action on the part of the Company, its directors and stockholders necessary for the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company, the authorization, sale, issuance and delivery of the Shares and the performance of the Company’s obligations hereunder has been taken. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and to limitations of public policy. The Shares have been duly and validly authorized and, upon the issuance and delivery thereof and payment therefor as contemplated by this Agreement, will be free and clear of liens other than liens caused by the Investors, duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The issuance and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby will not give rise to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal on behalf of any person.

##### 

4.4  No Conflict; Governmental Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the offer and sale of the Shares will not result in the violation of any material law, statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or governmental authority to or by which the Company is bound, or of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, and will not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, any lease, loan agreement, mortgage, security agreement, trust indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its properties or assets is subject, where such conflict, breach or default is likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any of the material properties or assets of the Company. 

(b) No consent, waiver, approval, authorization or other order of any governmental authority is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement or with the authorization, issuance and sale of the Shares, except such filings as may be required to be made, and which shall have been made at or prior to the required time, with the SEC, the NASD and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (“Nasdaq”), and with any state or foreign blue sky or securities regulatory authority. 

4.5  Licenses. The Company has all licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations currently required for the conduct of its business or ownership of properties and is in all material respects complying therewith, except for any licenses, permits or other governmental authorizations, the lack of which would not likely result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

4.6  Litigation. The Company knows of no pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings against the Company which would likely result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

4.7  Accuracy of Reports. All reports required to be filed by the Company within the three years prior to the date of this Agreement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”), have been duly and timely filed with the SEC, complied at the time of filing in all material respects with the requirements of their respective forms and, were complete and correct in all material respects as of the dates at which the information was furnished, and contained (as of such dates) no untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

4.8  Investment Company. The Company is not an “investment company” within the meaning of such term under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. 

4.9  Listing. The Company has filed a Notification Form: Listing of Additional Shares with the Nasdaq Stock Market and hereby represents and warrants to the 

4

4.12  Compliance with Laws. The Company is in compliance with all applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements. There are no proceedings pending or to the Company’s knowledge threatened against the Company relating to the continued listing of the Company’s Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Company has not received any notice of, nor to the knowledge of the Company is there any basis for, the delisting of the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market.

To the best of the Company’s knowledge, neither this Agreement nor any other documents, certificates or instruments furnished to the Investors by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a whole together with the Company Information, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made herein or therein, not misleading. 

4.15  Registration Statement; Effectiveness. The sale and issuance by the Company of the Shares have been validly registered pursuant to the Registration Statement and such Shares of Common Stock will be issued without a restrictive legend.

5.5  Each Investor understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other materials presented to the Investor in connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares constitutes legal, tax or investment advice.
