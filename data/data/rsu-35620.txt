KiOR, Inc. 

2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan 



1. Grant of Restricted Stock Units  
  
KiOR, Inc. (the “Company”) hereby grants to (the “Grantee”) an award of restricted stock units (the “RSUs”), effective as of February 24, 2012 (the “Grant Date”) in accordance with the KiOR, Inc. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). 

2. Relationship to the Plan  
  
This Award Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee from time to time. Any terms used in this Award Agreement and not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Plan. In the event of an inconsistency between the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan will control. 

3. Vesting  
  
Unless vested on an earlier date as provided in Section 7 hereof, the RSUs will vest as follows:   
  
Vesting Date

Percentage Vested  
  
provided that the Grantee has been continuously employed by the Company from the Grant Date through the applicable vesting date. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, all RSUs not then vested shall vest immediately upon termination if the Grantee’s employment with the Company terminates by reason of the Grantee’s Disability or death. If the Grantee’s employment with the Company terminates other than by reason of Disability or death, the RSUs (to the extent not then vested) shall be forfeited as of the date the Grantee’s employment so terminates. 

* * *

4. Non-Transferability  
  
No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the Grantee. Any purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or other encumbrance of the Restricted Stock, prior to the lapse of restrictions, that does not satisfy the requirements hereunder shall be void and unenforceable against the Company. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the Grantee’s Disability or death, the Grantee’s rights under this Award Agreement may be exercised by the Grantee (or his or her guardian) in the event of Disability or his or her Beneficiary in the event of death. 

5. Stockholder Rights  
  
The Grantee shall not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the RSUs, including voting and the right to receive dividends. 

6. Disability  
  
Determination of the date of termination of employment by reason of Disability and the satisfaction of the requirements for Disability shall be based on such evidence as the Committee may require and a determination by the Committee of such date of termination and satisfaction shall be final and controlling on all interested parties. 

7. Forfeiture  
  
If the Grantee’s employment is terminated prior to the date all of the RSUs vest pursuant to Section 3, such unvested RSUs shall be forfeited immediately, except as provided in this section. In the event of the Grantee’s death or Disability while employed by the Company prior to the date all of the RSUs vest pursuant to Section 3, all of such unvested RSUs shall be immediately vested. 

8. Settlement of RSUs  
  
Payment of vested RSUs shall be made in the form of cash or shares of Common Stock as determined by the Committee as soon as administratively practicable after the date the RSUs vest, but in no case later than the March 15th following the year in which vesting occurs. 

9. Tax Withholding  
  
The Committee may make such provisions as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which it determines is required in connection with this Award Agreement. 

10. Beneficiary  
  
The Grantee may designate a beneficiary to receive the RSUs that become vested due to the Grantee’s death, and may change the beneficiary designation from time to time. Beneficiary designations must be duly executed using the proper form designated by the Committee attached hereto as Exhibit A and timely filed with the Company’s General Counsel. If the Grantee fails to designate a beneficiary, any vested RSUs will be transferred to the legal representative of the Grantee’s estate.
