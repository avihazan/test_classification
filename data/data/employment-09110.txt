The Executive shall continue to receive his Annual Base Salary, annual bonus and all other compensation and perquisites referenced in Section 4 through the Date of Termination. 

6\. Severance Payments. 

(a) Termination for any Reason. In the event the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, the Company shall pay the Executive (or his beneficiary in the event of his death) any unpaid Annual Base Salary that has accrued as of the Date of Termination, any unreimbursed expenses due to the Executive in accordance with the Company’s expense reimbursement policy and an amount equal to compensation for accrued but unused sick days and vacation days. The Executive shall also be entitled to accrued, vested benefits under the Company’s benefit plans and programs as provided therein. The Executive shall be entitled to the additional payments and benefits described below only as set forth herein. 

(b) Termination without Cause, Resignation for Good Reason or Termination by Reason of Death or Disability. Subject to Sections 6(c) and (d) and the restrictions contained herein, in the event of the Executive’s Termination without Cause (pursuant to Section 5(a)(v)), Resignation for Good Reason (pursuant to Section 

* * *

5(a)(iv)) or termination by reason of death or Disability (pursuant to Section 5(a)(i) or (ii), respectively), the Company shall pay to the Executive the amounts described in subsection (a). In addition, subject to Section 6(c) and (d) and the restrictions contained herein, the Company shall do all of the following: 

(i) The Company shall pay to the Executive (or his beneficiary in the event of his death) an amount equal to the “Severance Amount” described below. For purposes of this Agreement the Severance Amount is equal to the sum of: 

(A) 1.0 times his Annual Base Salary (except that for a termination for Good Reason under clause (v) of the definition thereof, the amount shall be 1.5 times his Annual Base Salary), and 

(B) 1.0 times the greater of (I) the total of all bonuses paid (or payable) to executive in respect of the fiscal year ending immediately prior to the Date of Termination, excluding any bonuses that are extraordinary in nature (e.g., a transaction related bonus) or (II) the target bonuses for the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination falls, determined in accordance with the Company’s bonus program or programs, if any (except that for a termination for Good Reason under clause (v) of the definition thereof, the amount shall be 1.5 times the greater of the foregoing clauses (I) or (II)). 

The Severance Amount as so determined shall be payable to the Executive (or his beneficiary) in substantially equal installments of the 12 month period following the Date of Termination (the “Payment Period”) in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices; 

(ii) The Company shall offer to the Executive continuation of any health plan coverage of the Executive in accordance with the requirements of applicable law (e.g. COBRA coverage), at a monthly cost to the Executive that is not greater than the monthly cost that the Executive is being charged for such coverage or coverages as of the Date of Termination. The Company may require the Executive to complete and file any election forms that are generally required of other employees to obtain COBRA coverage; and the Executive’s COBRA coverage may be terminable in accordance with applicable law. 

(c) Benefits Provided Upon Termination of Employment. If the Executive’s termination or resignation does not constitute a “separation from service,” as such term is defined under Code Section 409A, the Executive shall nevertheless be entitled to receive all of the payments and benefits that the Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement on account of his termination of employment. However, the payments and benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement shall not be provided to the Executive until such time as the Executive has incurred a “separation from services” within the meaning of Code Section 409A. 

(d) Payments on Account of Termination to a Specified Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Sections 6(a) or 6(b), in the event that the Executive is determined to be a Specified Employee at the time of his termination of employment under this Agreement (or, if later, his “separation from service” under Code Section 409A), to the extent that a payment, reimbursement or benefit under Section 6(b) is considered to provide for a “deferral of compensation” (as determined under Code Section 409A), then such payment, reimbursement or benefit shall not be paid or provided until six months after the Executive’s separation from service, or his death, whichever occurs first. Any payments, reimbursements or benefits that are withheld under this provision for the first six months shall be payable in a lump sum on the 181st day after such termination of employment (or, if later, separation from service). The restrictions in this Section 6(d) shall be interpreted and applied solely to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, payments, benefits or reimbursements under Section 6(B) or any other part of this Agreement may nevertheless be provided to Executive with the six-month period following the date of Executive’s termination of employment under this Agreement (or, if later, his “separation from service” under Code Section 409A), to the extent that it would nevertheless be permissible to do so under Code Section 409A because those payments, reimbursements or benefits are (i) described in Treasury Regulations Section 409A because those payments, reimbursements or benefits are (i) described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (i.e., payments within the limitations therein that are being made on account of an involuntary termination or termination for good reason, within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations), or (ii) benefits described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) (e.g. health care benefits). 

* * *

7\. Competition; Nonsolicitation. 

(a) During the Term and, following any termination of Executive’s employment, for a period equal to (i) the Payment Period, in the case of a termination of employment for which payments are made pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, or (ii) 24 months from the date of such termination in the event of a voluntary termination of employment by the Executive without Good Reason, or a termination by the Company for Cause, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Board, directly or indirectly engage in, or have any interest in, or manage or operate any person, firm, corporation, partnership or business (whether as director, officer, employee, agent, representative, partner, security holder, consultant or otherwise) that engages in any business (other than a business that constitutes less than 5% of the relevant entity’s net revenue and a proportionate share of its operating income) which competes with any business of the Company or any entity owned by it anywhere in the world; provided, however, that the Executive shall be permitted to acquire a stock interest in such a corporation provided such stock is publicly traded and the stock so acquired does not represent more than one percent of the outstanding shares of such corporation. 

(b) During the Term and for a period of two years following any termination of the Executive’s employment, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, whether as an owner, employee, service provider or otherwise, solicit or induce any person who is or was employed by, or providing consulting services to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries during the twelve-month period prior to the date of such termination, to terminate their employment or consulting relationship with the Company or any such subsidiary. 

(c) In the event the agreement in this Section 7 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable, and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. 

8\. Nondisclosure of Proprietary Information. 

(a) Except as required in the faithful performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder or pursuant to subsection (c), the Executive shall, in perpetuity, maintain in confidence and shall not directly, indirectly or otherwise, use, disseminate, disclose or publish, or use for his benefit or the benefit of any person, firm, corporation or other entity any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of or relating to the Company, including, without limitation, information with respect to the Company’s operations, processes, products, inventions, business practices, finances, principals, vendors, suppliers, customers, potential customers, marketing methods, costs, prices, contractual relationships, regulatory status, compensation paid to employees or other terms of employment, except for such information which is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach by the Executive of this Section 8, or deliver to any person, firm, corporation or other entity any document, record, notebook, computer program or similar repository of or containing any such confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets. The parties hereby stipulate and agree that as between them the foregoing matters are important, material and confidential proprietary information and trade secrets and affect the successful conduct of the businesses of the Company (and any successor or assignee of the Company). 

(b) Upon termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company all correspondence, drawings, manuals, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, programs, plans, proposals, financial documents, or any other documents concerning the Company’s customers, business plans, marketing strategies, products or processes and/or which contain proprietary information or trade secrets. 

(c) The Executive may respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought and shall assist such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. 

9\. Injunctive Relief. It is recognized and acknowledged by the Executive that a breach of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 8 will cause irreparable damage to the Company and its goodwill, the exact amount of which will be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach will be inadequate. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections 7 and 8, in addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief. 

10\. Survival. The expiration or termination of the Term shall not impair the rights or obligations of any party hereto which shall have accrued hereunder prior to such expiration.
