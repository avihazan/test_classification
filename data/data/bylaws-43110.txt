Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from a newly created directorship, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors, shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A director of any class elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders. A director of any class elected by the shareholders to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. In no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. The election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Corporation’s Bylaws so require. 

Section 5.4. The shareholders shall not have the right to remove any one or all of the directors except for cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and  2/3% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (“Voting Stock”) that are not beneficially owned (as defined in Article Six) by any Interested Shareholder (as defined in Article Six). 

Section 5.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock that may be authorized in the future and issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of that class or series (“Preferred Stock Designation”) as determined by the shareholders or by the Board of Directors, and such directors so elected shall serve annual terms and shall not be divided into classes pursuant to Section 5.2 except as expressly provided by the Preferred Stock Designation for that class or series. 

Section 5.6. In addition to the powers and authority herein or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are herby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the Corporation Code, these Articles of Incorporation and any Bylaws adopted by the shareholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the shareholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted. 

Section 5.7. No action shall be taken by shareholders of the Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation or by unanimous written consent and the right of shareholders to act by less than unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting is specifically denied. Unless otherwise prescribed by law, special meetings of shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (ii) the President of the Corporation, (iii) the Secretary of the Corporation at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, or (iv) the Secretary of the Corporation at the request in writing of the holders of at least 66 and  2/3 % of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock that are not beneficially owned by any Interested Shareholder.

The Board of Directors may amend the Bylaws of the Corporation upon the affirmative vote of the number of directors required, under the terms of the Bylaws, to take action of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that any amendment, addition or repeal of any provision of the Bylaws regarding indemnification of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the Disinterested Directors. Shareholders may not amend the Bylaws of the Corporation except upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and  2/3% of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock that are not beneficially owned by any Interested Shareholder, except that the affirmative vote of the holders of only a majority to the Bylaws approved by the Board of Directors if at least two-thirds ( 2/3) of the directors then in office are Disinterested Directors.
