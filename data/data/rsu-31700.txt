Following the Committee's certification, the Participant shall vest in and be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the number of vested Performance Units, multiplied by (b) the Payout Value. Such cash payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Committee's certification and, in any event, on or before March 15, 2017. If, in accordance with the Committee's determination under Paragraph 3, the Vesting Percentage is zero, the Participant shall immediately forfeit any and all rights to the Performance Units.

termination, and the rights of the Participant and the obligations of the Corporation under this Award Agreement shall be terminated. 

  


6. Vesting Upon Termination of Employment due to Death. If Participant's Employment is terminated by reason of death prior to the close of the Performance Cycle, the Participant's right to receive the Performance Units shall vest in full as of the date of death, the Vesting Percentage shall be 100%, and the Payout Value for each Performance Unit shall be the Fair Market of a share of Common Stock on the date of the Participant's death. A cash payment equal to the vested value of the Performance Units shall be made to the Participant's estate on the first day of the third month following the death of the Participant. Such vesting and the making of the related cash payment (including, if applicable, a payment for Dividend Equivalents, as provided in Paragraph 9) shall satisfy the rights of the Participant and the obligations of the Corporation under this Award Agreement in full. 

  


7. Vesting Upon Termination of Employment due to Retirement. In the event of the Retirement of the Participant on or after completion of half of the Performance Cycle, the Participant may vest, at the discretion of the Committee, in a number of Performance Units equal to or less than the product of (a) the percentage equal to the days of Participant's Employment during the Performance Cycle divided by the total days in the Performance Cycle, (b) the number of Performance Units granted under this Award Agreement, and (c) the Vesting Percentage, as determined by the Committee under Paragraph 3. Following the Committee's determination under this Paragraph 7, the Participant shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the number of vested Performance Units, multiplied by (y) the Payout Value.

A cash payment equal to the vested value of the Performance Units shall be made on the first day of the third month following the Change in Control; provided, however that if such Change in Control fails to qualify as a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treas. Regs. section 1.409A-3(i)(5), then the cash payment will be made during the first week of January 2017. Such vesting and the making of the related cash payment shall satisfy the rights of the Participant and the obligations of the Corporation under this Award Agreement in full.

  


9. Dividend Equivalents. With respect to each of the Performance Units granted under Paragraph 1, the Participant shall be credited with Dividend Equivalents equal to the amount per share of Common Stock of any ordinary cash dividends declared by the Board with record dates during the period beginning on the first day of the Performance Cycle and ending on the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the Performance Cycle, (b) the effective date of a Change in Control and (c) the date on which the Performance Units otherwise vest or are forfeited in accordance with Paragraphs 5, 6 or 7.

Any Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited as and when the related Performance Units are forfeited in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreement.

  


10. Repayment or Forfeiture Resulting from Forfeiture Event.

  


(a) If there is a Forfeiture Event either while the Participant is employed or within two years after termination of the Participant's Employment, then the Committee may, but is not obligated to, cause some or all of the Participant's outstanding Performance Units to be forfeited by the Participant. 

  


(b) If there is a Forfeiture Event either while the Participant is employed or within two years after termination of the Participant's Employment and a payment has previously been made in settlement of Performance Units granted under this Award Agreement, the Committee may, but is not obligated to, require that the Participant pay to the Corporation an amount (the “Forfeiture Amount”) up to (but not in excess of) the amount paid in settlement of the Performance Units.

  


(c) This Paragraph 10 shall apply notwithstanding any provision of this Award Agreement to the contrary and is meant to provide the Corporation with rights in addition to any other remedy which may exist in law or in equity. This Paragraph 10 shall not apply to the Participant following the effective time of a Change in Control.

  


11. Taxes.
