In the event such meeting is not held at the time and place determined under the preceding sentence, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special 

3 

* * *

meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the Directors. 

SECTION 6. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.

SECTION 8. Quorum. At all meeting of the Board a majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

SECTION 10. Action by Consent. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. 

SECTION 11. Executive and Other Committees. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, appoint three or more of its members to constitute an Executive Committee which to the extent provided by the Board of Directors shall have and exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. All action taken by the Executive Committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at its first meeting thereafter. The Board of Directors may also from time to time by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board appoint other committees from among its members and/or officers of the corporation, and such committee or committees shall have such powers and duties to be exercised under the control and direction of the Board of Directors as the latter may from time to time prescribe.

4 

* * *

Directors, a majority of the members of any committee appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section shall constitute a quorum at any meeting thereof and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee.

SECTION 2. Classes of Stock—Rights. If the corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock, or more than one series of any class, the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class of stock; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests, the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

8 

* * *

Vice President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary may be facsimile. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation. 

SECTION 4. Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost or destroyed. 

SECTION 5. Transfers of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock shall be made upon the transfer books of the corporation, kept at the office of the transfer agent designated to transfer the shares, only upon direction of the person named in the certificate or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing. The corporation is under a duty to register the transfer of its shares only if: 

(a) the old share certificate is surrendered and is endorsed by the appropriate person or persons; and 

(b) reasonable assurance is given that the endorsements are genuine and effective; and 

(c) the corporation has no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any such duty; and

In lieu of closing the stock transfer books as aforesaid, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, not less than ten nor more than sixty days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go 

9

into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining such consent, as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meetings, and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, or to give such consent, and in such case such stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. 

SECTION 7. Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognized the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
