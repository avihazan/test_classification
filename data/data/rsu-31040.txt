Total Number of Shares to Be Granted:  ___________

1\. Grant of Restricted Stock. The Board of Directors of the Company, subject to the terms and provisions of the OriginOil, Inc. Restricted Stock Award Plan, as amended (the “Plan”) hereby awards to the Grantee, effective as of the Effective Date, the number of shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, set forth above as restricted stock (the “Restricted Stock”) on the following terms and conditions. As used in this Agreement, the term “Shares” shall mean shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement, and all securities received (i) in replacement of the Shares, (ii) as a result of stock dividends or stock splits with respect to the Shares, (iii) in replacement of the Shares in a merger, recapitalization, reorganization or similar corporate transaction; and (iv) pursuant to an adjustment to the number of Shares issuable on any vesting date by virtue of Section 2.6 of this Agreement.

2. Eligibility for Vesting and Issuance The Shares of Restricted Stock shall become eligible for vesting, and shall vest and be issued to the Grantee, upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement. The Restricted Shares are forfeitable as set forth in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 of this Agreement.

2.1 Schedule of Company Performance Goals. Shares of Restricted Stock shall become eligible for vesting (and shall become “Eligible Restricted Shares”) for each Company Performance Goal attained as follows:

Restricted Shares Company Performance Goals  
[40%] The Company’s consolidated gross revenue, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, equals or exceeds $2,500,000 for the trailing twelve-month period as reported in the Company’s quarterly or annual financial statements  
[60%] The Company’s consolidated net profit, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, equals or exceeds $500,000 for the trailing twelve-month period as reported in the Company’s quarterly or annual financial statements.  
  
1  
  
2.2 Vesting and Issuance of Eligible Restricted Shares. Eligible Restricted Shares shall vest on a monthly basis, based on the following formula:

Vesting Percentage x Prior Monthly Trade Value  
Monthly Vested Shares = Fair Market Value of the Company’s Shares  
  
For the purposes of this Agreement,

(i) the “Prior Monthly Trade Value” of the Company’s Shares shall mean the aggregate sum of the Daily Trade Value in the calendar month immediately before the date of determination.

(ii) the “Daily Trade Value” is defined as the closing trade price of the Company’s Shares multiplied by the daily trade volume. For example, if the closing trade price was $1.00 and the daily trade volume on that day was 500,000 shares, then the Daily Trade Value for that day would be $500,000.

(iii) the “Vesting Percentage” shall mean the product (expressed as a percentage) of (a) 10%, multiplied by (b) a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of Eligible Restricted Shares at the date of determination, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares issued under the Plan at the date of determination, and which shall initially be 66,050,000. For example, if the numerator is 1,000,000 and the denominator is 66,050,000, then the Vesting Percentage shall be 0.1514%.

(iv) the “Fair Market Value” shall equal the average of the trailing ten (10) closing trade prices of the Company’s common stock on the last ten (10) trading days of the month immediately prior to the date of determination as quoted on the public securities trading market on which the Company’s common stock is then traded; provided, that if the Company’s common stock is not then publicly trading or quoted, “Fair Market Value” shall be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in good faith.

If the Company’s common stock is no longer publicly traded, then the Board of Directors in good faith shall determine the Monthly Vested Shares.

If the Prior Monthly Trade Value is less than $50,000, then zero Eligible Restricted Shares shall vest for that month.

By way of example only, if the Vesting Percentage is 0.1514%, the Prior Monthly Trade Value is $10,000,000 and the Fair Market Value is $1.00, then the number of Monthly Vested Shares shall be 15,140.

The Monthly Vested Shares, if any, shall be issued to the Grantee within five (5) business days after the last day of each month.

2.3 Forfeiture. Grantee shall forfeit all vesting rights for any Eligible Restricted Shares that have not vested within five (5) years of the date that the Eligible Restricted Shares became eligible for vesting.

2.4 Termination. If the Grantee ceases to provide any services to the Company as officer, director, employee or consultant, for any reason before the date that the Company Performance Goals have been met (it being understood that if the Grantee continues without interruption to serve thereafter in one or more capacities as officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company this shall not be considered a cessation of service), then the Shares of Restricted Stock associated with the unmet Company Performance Goals as of the date of such cessation of services shall immediately be forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services. The Eligible Restricted Shares associated with any Company Performance Goals met prior to the date the Grantee ceases to provide any services to the Company shall continue to vest in accordance with Sections 2.2 of this Agreement.

2  
  
2.5 Title to Shares. The exact spelling of the name(s) under which Grantee shall take title to the Shares is:

Grantee desires to take title to the Shares as follows:

[ ] Individual, as separate property

[ ] Husband and wife, as community property

[ ] Joint Tenants

2.6 Adjustment to Number of Shares. The Company agrees that if the Fair Market Value of the Company’s common stock on the Monthly Vesting Date is less than the Fair Market Value of the Company’s common stock on the Effective Date, then the number of Monthly Vested Shares issuable (assuming all conditions are satisfied) within ten business days of the Monthly Vesting Date shall be increased so that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Monthly Vested Shares issuable equals the aggregate Fair Market Value that such number of Shares would have had on the Effective Date.

3\. Representations and Warranties of Grantee. Grantee represents and warrants to the Company that:
