In the event that you forfeit the Restricted Stock prior to settlement, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock; provided, however, that such a forfeiture shall not create any obligation for you to repay any dividends received prior to that forfeiture nor shall it invalidate any votes that you have given during the time that you held the Restricted Stock.

4. Restrictions; Forfeiture. The Restricted Stock are restricted in that they may not be sold, transferred or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until these restrictions are removed or expire as contemplated in Section 5 or 6 of this Agreement.

The Company shall have the full right to cancel any evidence of your ownership of forfeited Restricted Stock or to take any other action necessary to demonstrate that you no longer own the forfeited Restricted Stock.

The provisions of this Award regarding the forfeiture and transfer of forfeited Restricted Stock shall be specifically performable by the Company in any court of equity or law. 

5. Expiration of Restrictions and Risk of Forfeiture. Except as provided otherwise in Section 6, the restrictions on the Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Agreement will expire and the Restricted Stock will become transferable and nonforfeitable, provided that you remain in the employ of, or a service provider to, the Company or its Subsidiaries until the applicable dates set forth below in Section 5(a) and 5(b) (each, a “Vesting Date”): 

  


* * *

Ex. 10.1

  


(a) Time-Based Restricted Stock. [TBD] of the total number of Restricted Stock shall vest based upon the passage of time (the “Time-Based Restricted Stock”) in accordance with the following schedule:   
  
Percentage of Time-Based Restricted Stock to Vest

Vesting Date  
  
[x]%

[x]  
  
Total: [x]%  
  
  


(b) Performance-Based Restricted Stock. [TBD]

If an installment of the vesting would result in a fractional share of Restricted Stock becoming vested, that installment will be rounded to the next higher or lower share, as determined by the Company, except for the final installment, which will be for the balance of the Award.

  


6. Termination of Services and Change in Control. 

(a) Termination Generally. Subject to subsection (b), (c), or (d), if your service relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated for any reason, then those Restricted Stock (both Time-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock) for which the restrictions have not lapsed as of the date of termination shall become null and void and those Restricted Stock shall be forfeited to the Company without any payment to you. The Restricted Stock for which the restrictions have lapsed as of the date of such termination shall not be forfeited to the Company. For purposes of clarity, if your service relationship is transferred between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, such a transfer shall not constitute a termination of the service relationship unless the transfer would be deemed to be a “separation from service” pursuant to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules.

(b) Death. In the event that your service relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated due to your death, all Time-Based Restricted Stock that has not already become vested pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement shall immediately become vested. For purposes of clarity, the termination of your service relationship due to your death will not automatically vest your Performance-Based Restricted Stock. 

(c) Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, all Restricted Stock that has not already become vested pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall immediately become vested.

(d) Effect of Individual Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any inconsistency between Sections 5 or 6 and any individual employment, severance, change in control or other similar agreement entered into by and between you and the Company, the terms of such other agreement shall control.

7. Leave of Absence. With respect to the Award, the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine that if you are on leave of absence for any reason you will be considered to still be in the employ of, or providing services for, the Company, provided that rights to the Restricted Stock during a leave of absence will be limited to the extent to which those rights were earned or vested when the leave of absence began.

8. Delivery of Stock. Promptly following the expiration of the restrictions on the Restricted Stock as contemplated in Section 5 of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to you or your designee a certificate or other evidence of the number of Restricted Stock as to which restrictions have lapsed, free of any restrictive legend relating to the lapsed restrictions, upon receipt by the Company of any tax withholding as may be requested pursuant to Section 9. The value of such Restricted Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time.

9. Tax Issues. 

(a) Payment of Taxes. The Company may require you to pay to the Company (or the Company’s Subsidiary if you are an employee of a Subsidiary of the Company), an amount the Company deems necessary to satisfy its (or its Subsidiary’s) current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes that you incur as a result of the Award. With respect to any required tax withholding, you may (a) direct the Company to withhold from the shares of Stock to be issued to you under this Agreement the number of shares necessary to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold taxes; which determination will be based on the shares’ Fair Market Value on the applicable Vesting Date; (b) deliver to the Company shares of Stock sufficient to satisfy the Company’s tax withholding obligations, based on the shares’ Fair Market Value on the applicable Vesting Date; (c) deliver cash to the Company sufficient to satisfy its tax withholding obligations; or (d) satisfy such tax withholding through any combination of (a), (b) and (c). If you desire to elect to use the stock withholding option described in subparagraph (a), you must make the election at the time and in the manner the Company prescribes. The Company, in its discretion, may deny your request to satisfy its tax withholding obligations using a method described under subparagraph (a) or (b). In the event the Company determines that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock withheld as payment of any tax withholding obligation is insufficient to discharge that tax withholding obligation, then you must pay to the Company, in cash, the amount of that deficiency immediately upon the Company’s request.

Ex. 10.1

  


(b) Elections. By accepting this Award, you acknowledge that Section 83 of the Code generally requires that the applicable portion of the Award be taxed to you as ordinary income on each applicable Vesting Date. You also acknowledge that, provided that you are a U.S. citizen, you may elect to be taxed at the Date of Grant rather than at the time the Restricted Stock vest by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service and by providing a copy of the election to the Company. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE AVAILABILITY OF MAKING AN ELECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 83(b) OF THE CODE; THAT SUCH ELECTION MUST BE FILED WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (AND A COPY OF THE ELECTION GIVEN TO THE COMPANY) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK; AND THAT GRANTEE IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SUCH ELECTION. You further acknowledge that the tax consequences associated with this Award are complex and that the Company has urged you to review with your own tax advisors the federal, state and local tax consequences of this Award. You are relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. 

10. Compliance with Securities Law. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of Stock (including Restricted Stock) will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state, or foreign law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), is at the time of issuance in effect with respect to the shares issued or (a) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issued may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Award will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance hereunder, the Company may require you to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. From time to time, the Board and appropriate officers of the Company are authorized to take the actions necessary and appropriate to file required documents with governmental authorities, stock exchanges, and other appropriate Persons to make shares of Stock available for issuance.
