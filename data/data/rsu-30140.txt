(i) Provided that Employee either qualifies for “Early Retirement” or “Normal Retirement” under the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Retirement Plan (the “Retirement Plan”), or is a Late Career Recipient (as defined below), in the case of Employee’s death or Disability, Employee shall be deemed to have been employed by the Company through the end of the Performance Period and Employee (or his or her estate) will receive the Stock, if any, to which Employee is entitled at the time specified in Section 4(a). 

(ii) In the case of Employee’s Termination of Employment during the Performance Period which constitutes an Early Retirement or a Normal Retirement under the Retirement Plan, Employee shall be deemed to have been employed by the Company through the end of the Performance Period and Employee (or his or her estate) will receive the Stock, if any, to which Employee is entitled at the time specified in Section 4(a). 

(iii) If, at the time of Employee’s death, Disability or retirement Employee has reached sixty (60) years of age and has been credited with at least five (5) Years of Service, as defined under the Retirement Plan, and does not otherwise meet the criteria for Early Retirement or Normal Retirement under the Retirement Plan, Employee shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a “Late Career Recipient”. Upon a Late Career Recipient’s retirement during the Performance Period, Employee will receive a straight prorated payout of the number of Performance Shares calculated in accordance with Section 5 based on the number of days Employee was employed during the Performance Period. Upon a Late Career Recipient’s retirement following the end of the Performance Period, Employee will receive a payout of the number of Performance Shares calculated in accordance with Section 5. No fractional Stock shall be issued. If the Stock payout results in a fractional share of one-half or greater, such fraction will be increased to provide for the issuance of a full share of Stock. Employee will receive the Stock, if any, to which Employee is entitled at the time specified in Section 4(a).   
  
(c)

Termination Without Cause. In the event Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company may determine in his discretion if, to what extent, and when any unvested portion of the Performance Shares granted under this Agreement should vest; provided, however, that (i) any vesting of unvested Performance Shares granted under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall be approved by the Committee, and (ii) nothing herein shall obligate the CEO to exercise his discretion to cause any unvested Performance Shares to vest.  
  
(d)

Termination For Cause. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 4, in the event Employee is terminated for Cause, then regardless of Employee’s retirement, Early Retirement, Normal Retirement, death or Disability, Employee shall forfeit the right to receive any Stock hereunder that Employee would otherwise be entitled to receive following his or her date of termination. For purposes only of this Section 4(d), “Cause” means (A) embezzlement, theft, fraud, deceit and/or dishonesty by the Employee involving the property, business or affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (B) an act of moral turpitude which in the sole judgment of the CEO reflects adversely on the business or reputation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or negatively affects any of the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ employees or customers.  
  
(e)

Disability. “Disability” has the meaning set forth for such term in the Retirement Plan.   
  
(f)

Dividend Equivalents. In satisfaction of the Dividend Equivalents Award made pursuant to Section 1, at the time of the Company’s delivery of Stock to Employee pursuant to this Section 4, the Company also will deliver to Employee fully transferrable shares of Stock equal in value to the amount of dividends, if any, that Employee would have received if Employee had directly owned the Stock to which the Performance Shares relate from the Date of Grant to the date of the Stock payout, plus interest on such amount at the rate of 5 percent compounded quarterly, as determined pursuant to the Plan. The number of shares   
  
  


2

* * *

  


  


of Stock distributed to Employee will be determined by dividing the amount of the Dividend Equivalents and interest by the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock as of the applicable date of the Stock payout. No fractional Stock shall be issued. If the Stock payout results in a fractional share of one-half or greater, such fraction will be increased to provide for the issuance of a full share of Stock.  
  
(g)

Impact on Retirement Plans. The value of the shares of Stock distributed upon payment for the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents will be disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of Employee’s benefit under any Company retirement plans.  
  
5.

Performance Criteria and Adjustments. Fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares awarded under this Award Agreement will be determined pursuant to Section 5(a) and fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares awarded under this Award Agreement will be determined pursuant to Section 5(b). In no event will Employee be entitled to receive a number of Performance Shares pursuant to this Award Agreement greater than 2.0 times the Base Grant.  
  
(a)

Adjustment of Base Grant for Total Shareholder Return. Fifty percent (50%) of the Base Grant will increase or decrease based upon the Company’s “Total Shareholder Return” as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the companies in the Growth Index during the Performance Period, as follows:  
  
If the Company’s Total Shareholder Return Over The Performance Period As Compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the Companies in the Growth Index is:

  


The Number of Performance Shares will be:  
  
90th Percentile or greater

75th Percentile

1.0 X Base Grant

.75 X Base Grant  
  
50th Percentile

0.5 X Base Grant  
  
25th Percentile

0.25 X Base Grant  
  
Less than 25th Percentile

None  
  
If intermediate percentiles are achieved, the number of Performance Shares awarded will be prorated (partial shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share when applicable). For example, if the Company’s Total Shareholder Return during the Performance Period places the Company’s performance in the 60th percentile, then the number of Performance Shares would be increased to 0.60 (0.5 X 60/50) multiplied by the Base Grant. In no event will Employee be entitled to receive a number of Performance Shares pursuant to this Subsection 5(a) greater than 1.0 times the Base Grant.   
  
(b)

Adjustment of Base Grant for Performance Metrics. Fifty percent (50%) of the Base Grant will increase or decrease based upon the Company’s “Average Performance” with respect to the “Performance Metrics,” as follows:  
  
If the Company’s Average Performance is:

The Number of Performance Shares will be:

  
  
  
90th Percentile or greater

75th Percentile

1.0 X Base Grant

.75 X Base Grant  
  
50th Percentile

0.5 X Base Grant  
  
25th Percentile

0.25 X Base Grant  
  
Less than 25th Percentile

None

If intermediate percentiles are achieved, the number of Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Subsection 5(b) will be prorated (partial shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share when applicable). For example, if the Company’s Average Performance during the Performance Period places the Company’s performance in the 60th percentile, then the number of Performance Shares would be increased to .60 (0.5 X 60/50) multiplied by the Base Grant. In no event will Employee be entitled to receive a number of Performance Shares pursuant to this Subsection (b) greater than 1.0 times the Base Grant.  
  
6.

Definitions.  
  
(a)

Performance Metrics. The “Performance Metrics” for the Performance Period are: (i) the JD Power Residential National Large Segment Survey for investor-owned utilities; (ii) the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (Major Events Excluded) (“SAIFI”); (iii) Arizona Public Service Company’s customer to employee improvement ratio; (iv) the OSHA rate (All Incident Injury Rate); (v) nuclear capacity factor; and (vi) coal capacity factor.   
  
(1)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (i) of this Subsection 6(a), the JD Power Residential National Large Segment Survey will provide data on an annual basis reflecting the Company’s percentile ranking, relative to other participating companies.   
  
(2)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (ii) of this Subsection 6(a), the Edison Electric Institute (“EEI”) will provide data on an annual basis regarding the SAIFI result of the participating companies; the Company will calculate its SAIFI result for the year in question and determine its percentile ranking based on the information provided by EEI.  
  
(3)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (iii) of this Subsection 6(a), SNL, an independent third party data system, will provide data on an annual basis regarding the customer and employee counts; the Company will use its customer and employee counts for the year in question and determine its percentile ranking based on the information provided by SNL. Only those companies whose customers and employees were included in the data provided by SNL in each of the years of the Performance Period will be considered.  
  
(4)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (iv) of this Subsection 6(a), EEI will provide data on an annual basis regarding the OSHA rate of the participating companies; the Company will calculate its OSHA rate for the year in question and determine its percentile ranking based on the information provided by EEI.  
  
(5)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (v) of this Subsection 6(a), SNL will provide data on an annual basis regarding the nuclear capacity factors of the participating nuclear plants; the Company will calculate its nuclear capacity factor for the year in question and determine its percentile ranking based on the information provided by SNL. Only those plants that were included in the data provided by SNL in each of the years of the Performance Period will be considered.  
  
(6)

With respect to the Performance Metric described in clause (vi) of this Subsection 6(a), SNL will provide data on an annual basis regarding the coal capacity factors of the participating coal plants; the Company will calculate its coal capacity factor for the year in question and determine its percentile ranking based on the information provided by SNL. Only those plants that were included in the data provided by SNL in each of the years of the Performance Period will be considered.

(7)

The Company’s percentile ranking during the Performance Period for each Performance Metric will be the average of the Company’s percentile ranking for each Performance Metric during each of the three years of the Performance Period (each, an “Average Performance Metric”); provided, however, that if the third year of a Performance Metric is not calculable by December 15 of the following year, the Performance Metric shall consist of the three most recent years for which such Performance Metric is calculable. The Company’s “Average Performance,” for purposes of determining any Base Grant adjustments pursuant to Subsection 5(b) above will be the average of the Average Performance Metrics. If only quartile, rather than percentile, rankings are available for a particular Performance Metric, the Average Performance Metric for any such Performance Metric shall be expressed as a percentile. For example, if the Performance Metric was in the top quartile for two Performance Periods and in the lowest quartile in the other Performance Period, the average of these quartiles would be 3 (the average of 4, 4, and 1) and the Average Performance Metric would be the 75th percentile (3 /4). The calculations in this Subsection 6(a)(7) will be verified by the Company’s internal auditors.  
  
(8)

If either EEI or SNL discontinues providing the data specified above, the Committee shall select a data source that, in the Committee’s judgment, will provide data most comparable to the data provided by EEI or SNL, as the case may be. If the JD Power Residential National Large Segment Survey for investor-owned utilities (or a successor JD Power survey) is not available during each of the years of the Performance Period, the Performance Metric associated with the JD Power Residential Survey (Subsection 6(a)(1)) will be disregarded and not included in the Company’s Average Performance for purposes of determining any Base Grant adjustments pursuant to Subsection 5(b).  
  
(b)

Total Shareholder Return. “Total Shareholder Return” for the Performance Period is the measure of a company’s stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid during the Performance Period. Only those companies that were included in the Growth Index in each of the years of the Performance Period will be considered. Total Shareholder Return for the Company and the companies in the Growth Index will be determined using the Daily Comparative Return as calculated by Bloomberg (or other independent third party data system). If the Growth Index is discontinued, the Committee shall select the most comparable index then in use for the sector comparison. In addition, if the sector comparison is no longer representative of the Company’s industry or business, the Committee shall replace the Growth Index with the most representative index then in use. Once the Total Shareholder Returns of the Company and all relevant companies in the Growth Index have been determined, the member companies will be ranked from greatest to least. Percentiles will be calculated (interpolated from 0% to 100%) based on a company’s relative ranking. Percentiles will be carried out to one (1) decimal place. If the Company is not in the Growth Index, then its percentile will be interpolated between the companies listed in the relative ranking. These calculations will be verified by the Company’s internal auditors.  
  
7.

Termination of Award. This Award Agreement will terminate and be of no further force or effect on the date that Employee is no longer employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether due to voluntary or involuntary termination, death, retirement, Disability, or otherwise, except as specifically set forth in Section 4 above or in Article 15 of the Plan. Employee will, however, be entitled to receive any Stock and Dividend Equivalents payable under Section 4 of this Award Agreement if Employee’s employment terminates after the end of the Performance Period but before Employee’s receipt of such Stock and Dividend Equivalents.  
  
8.
