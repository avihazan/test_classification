5

(i) The Company may require each holder of Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement.

4\. Registration Expenses. The Company shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2 and 3. 

5\. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each such holder and each person who controls any such holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in 

6 

* * *

conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have. 

(b) Each holder of securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Shelf Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such holder, but only if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such holder specifically for inclusion in the applicable document referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement shall be acknowledged by each Notice Holder in such Notice Holder’s Notice and Questionnaire and shall be in addition to any liability that any such Notice Holder may otherwise have. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party’s choice at the indemnifying party’s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party’s election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there is or would be a conflict of interest between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the indemnifying party’s expense, the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense of such action on such indemnified party’s behalf); or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate 

7 

* * *

counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. 

(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively, “Losses”) to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 5, each person who controls a holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Shelf Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 5, and shall survive the sale by a holder of securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement. 

6\. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate original principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding; provided that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 5 hereof shall be effective as against any holder of Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such holder; and provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 6 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of each holder.
