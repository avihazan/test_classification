2.6

If the Outsource Agreement is terminated during an initial term of 9 years from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”) and the Minibar System removed from the Hotel, then HOMI will, at its own cost, reinstall the Minibar System at one or more other hotels at which the Minibar System will have equivalent revenue earning capacity as in the Hotel, as soon as possible and in any event within 6 months of its removal from the Hotel.  
  
2.7

If reinstallation was not performed within said 6 months, then HOMI shall be obliged, at any time during the following 3 months, to transfer the fixed charge being granted to Lender under Section 5.1 below, to other installed minibars, of equivalent value and revenue earning capacity, and such other minibars will then form the basis for the computations as set forth in Section 2.2above.  
  
2.8
