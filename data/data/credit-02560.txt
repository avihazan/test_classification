(b) Binding Obligations. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Loan Agreement and all of the other Loan Documents by Borrower have been duly authorized by all necessary action by Borrower, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as limited by Bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws of general application relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights and except to the extent specific remedies may generally be limited by equitable principles. 

(c) No Consent. The execution, delivery and performance of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not (i) conflict with, result in a violation of, or constitute a default under (A) any provision of its partnership agreement, any provision of the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Borrower's general or limited partner, or any agreement or other instrument binding upon Borrower, its general or limited partner, or (B) any law, governmental regulation, court decree or order applicable to Borrower, or (ii) require the consent, approval or authorization of any third party.

* * *

  


(c) The occurrence of an event of default under any of the other Loan Documents or under any other agreement now existing or hereafter arising between Lender and Borrower after the giving of any required notice and expiration of any applicable cure period. 

(d) Any representation contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents made by Borrower or any Obligated Party is false or misleading in any material respect.

14\. Waiver and Agreement. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of Lender to exercise any right, power or privilege herein or under any of the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any provision in this Loan Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents and no departure by Borrower therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lender, and then shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given and to the extent specified in such writing. No modification or amendment to this Loan Agreement or to any of the other Loan Documents shall be valid or effective unless the same is signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced. 

15\. Benefits. This Loan Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Lender and Borrower, and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that Borrower may not, without the prior written consent of Lender, assign any rights, powers, duties or obligations under this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. 

16\. Notices. All notices, requests, demands or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and given by (i) personal delivery, (ii) expedited delivery service with proof of delivery, or (iii) United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the intended addressee at the address set forth on the first page hereof and shall be deemed to have been received either, in the case of personal delivery, as of the time of personal delivery, in the case of expedited delivery service, as of the date of first attempted delivery at the address and in the manner provided herein, or in the case of mail, upon deposit in a depository receptacle under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service. Either party shall have the right to change its address for notice hereunder to any other location within the continental United States by notice to the other party of such new address at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such new address. 

17\. Construction. This Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been executed and delivered in the State of Texas, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, and shall be performable by the parties hereto in the county in Texas where the Lender's address set forth on the first page hereof is located. 

18\. Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, such provision shall be fully severable and the remaining provisions of this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance.

* * *

  


19\. Expenses. Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with (i) any action required in the course of administration of the indebtedness and obligations evidenced by the Loan Documents, and (ii) any action in the enforcement of Lender's rights upon the occurrence of Event of Default. 

20\. Participation of the Loans. Borrower agrees that Lender may, at its option, sell interests in the Loans and its rights under this Loan Agreement to a financial institution or institutions and, in connection with each such sale, Lender may disclose any financial and other information available to Lender concerning Borrower to each prospective purchaser. 

21\. Conflicts. In the event any term or provision hereof is inconsistent with or conflicts with any provision of the other Loan Documents, the terms and provisions contained in this Loan Agreement shall be controlling. 

22\. Counterparts. This Loan Agreement may be separately executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which, taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. 

23\. Facsimile Documents and Signatures. For purposes of negotiating and finalizing this Loan Agreement, if this document or any document executed in connection with it is transmitted by facsimile machine ("fax"), it shall be treated for all purposes as an original document. Additionally, the signature of any party on this document transmitted by way of a facsimile machine shall be considered for all purposes as an original signature. Any such faxed document shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as an original document.
