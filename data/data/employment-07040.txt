The Employee covenants that, at the Employer’s request, the Employee shall work overtime and/ or outside the normal working hours whenever a proper performance of duties so requires. With respect to said overtime, no remuneration shall be paid.   
  
4. The Employee shall within the boundaries of his position, perform the duties assigned by the Employer management.   
  
5. The Employee shall also perform, within the boundaries of his position, the functions reasonably assigned to the Employee by the Employer for any member of the Affiliated Companies. Such functions shall be governed by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and shall not entitle the Employee to any further remuneration.   
  
6. For the purposes of this Agreement, an “Affiliated Company” is any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Employer.   
  
Article 3. Salary, holiday and benefits  
  
1. The Employee shall receive a fixed base salary of € 262,987.00 gross on an annual basis (“Annual Base Salary”), prorated to the Effective Date, to be paid in twelve equal monthly instalments, payable in arrears on the last day of every calendar month. The Employee’s 8% holiday allowance is included in this amount.   
  
2 The Employee is also eligible (provided he is employed by the Employer or an Affiliated Company through the last working day of the calendar year) for additional variable compensation (“the Additional Variable Compensation”) in accordance with the Forrester Research, Inc. Amended and Restated Executive Cash Incentive Plan (“the Plan”). For the period January 1, 2013 through the Effective Date, the Employee’s annualized target Additional Variable Compensation is €98,007.00 gross. As of the Effective Date, the Employee’s annualized target Additional Variable Compensation is €112,708.00 gross. The Employee acknowledges that Forrester Research, Inc. has reserved the right to change the terms and conditions of the Plan, or to cease operation of the Plan, at any time in order to reflect business goals. The exact amount of Additional Variable Compensation earned, if any, will be measured and determined annually in accordance with the Plan. As a result, the Employee may earn more or less than any targeted amount.   
  
3. The Employee’s Annual Base Salary will be reviewed at least once each year but neither the Employer nor any Affiliated Company shall be under any obligation to increase it following any such review. The award of any increase and the amount of any such increase will be at the Employer’s sole discretion.   
  
4.

Subject to the approval of the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of Forrester Research, Inc., the Employee shall be granted on the Effective Date an option to purchase 10,000 shares of the common stock of Forrester Research, Inc. with an exercise price equal to the closing price of such common stock on the grant date pursuant to the Forrester Research, Inc.

6. The Employer shall reimburse the Employee for the income-related contribution for medical insurance (zorgverzekering). The payments will be made directly through payroll, as the Employer’s contribution is subject to tax deductions. In addition, the Employer shall make a contribution towards the Employee’s annual nominal premium for health care, which is subject to tax deductions. The Employee will provide the Employer with a copy of his health insurance policy.   
  
7.

The Employee authorises the Employer to withhold the Employee’s contribution from the salary in equal and consecutive instalments, if possible.
