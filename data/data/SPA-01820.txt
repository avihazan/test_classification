4. Investor Representations and Warranties. The Investor represents and warrants to the Corporation that:

a. Account. The Investor is acquiring the Shares for investment for its own account, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and it has no present intention of selling or distributing any of the Shares. The Investor understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. as amended (the “Securities Act”) by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment as expressed herein.

b. Access to Data. The Investor has had an opportunity to discuss the Corporation's business, management and financial affairs with its management and to obtain any additional information which the Investor has deemed necessary or appropriate for deciding whether or not to purchase the Securities, and has had an opportunity to receive, review and understand the disclosures and information regarding the Corporation's financial statements, capitalization and other business information as set forth in Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC Filings”) which are all incorporated herein by reference, together with all exhibits referenced therein. Investor understands that any information obtained from the Corporation that has not been disclosed in the Corporation's SEC Filings is confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party or used by the Investor for purposes of trading in the Corporation's publicly traded stock until such information is publicly released by the Corporation. The Investor acknowledges that no other representations or warranties, oral or written, have been made by the Corporation or any agent thereof except as set forth in this Agreement.

c. No Fairness Determination. The Investor is aware that no federal, state or other agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness of the investment, nor made any recommendation or endorsement of the Shares.

d. Limited Public Market.

There is no guarantee that a more established public market will develop at any time in the future. The Investor understands that the Shares are all unregistered and may not presently be sold in even this limited public market. The Investor understands that the Shares cannot be readily sold or liquidated in case of an emergency or other financial need. The Investor has sufficient liquid assets available so that the purchase and holding of the Shares will not cause it undue financial difficulties. The Investor further acknowledges that the Corporation, nor any of its officers or directors, have given any opinion or recommendation as to the value of the Shares or the investment in the Corporation.

e. Authority. If Investor is a corporation, partnership, trust or estate: (i) the individual executing and delivering this Agreement on behalf of the Investor has been duly authorized and is duly qualified to execute and deliver this Agreement on behalf of Investor in connection with the purchase of the Shares and (ii) the signature of such individual is binding upon Investor.
