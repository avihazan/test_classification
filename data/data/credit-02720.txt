ARTICLE IV 

PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PRIMARY CREDIT AGREEMENT 

4.1. General. The following provisions shall apply at all times until the termination of the Non-Extended Commitments on the Commitment Termination Date: 

(a) No Revolving Loan shall be made by a Lender pursuant to an Extended Commitment unless there shall simultaneously be made a “Revolving Loan” under and as defined in the Primary Credit Agreement (the “Corresponding Loan”) by the same Lender pursuant to its “Extended Commitment” under the Primary Credit Agreement, which Corresponding Loan shall bear the same proportion to the “Commitment” of such Lender under the Primary Credit Agreement as such Revolving Loan bears to such Lender’s Extended Commitment, and shall be of the same Type and, if applicable, for the same Interest Period, as such Revolving Loan. No conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Revolving Loan (or portion thereof) shall be made hereunder unless there shall be made simultaneously a conversion, continuation or prepayment of the Corresponding Loan (or a ratable portion thereof) under the Primary Credit Agreement. 

(b) The maximum LC Exposure specified in Section 2.6(b) shall apply on a combined basis to the LC Exposures under and as defined in both Credit Agreements and (i) each Letter of Credit under and as defined in the Primary Credit Agreement will be deemed also to be issued under this Agreement (it being understood that the LC Exposure in respect of each such Letter of Credit for purposes of this Agreement shall exclude the participations of the “Lenders” under the Primary Credit Agreement in such Letter of Credit); (ii) each Lender will acquire (or, in the case of any Existing Letter of Credit, will be deemed to have acquired) under this Agreement a participation in each Letter of Credit bearing the same proportion to its Commitment hereunder as its participation in such Letter of Credit under the Primary Credit Agreement bears to its Extended Commitment thereunder; (iii) the provisions of Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreements will operate, and the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender will have the same rights and obligations, as if the Letters of Credit had been issued under a single credit agreement having the terms set forth in Section 2.6; and (iv) the portion of each Letter of Credit deemed issued under this Agreement shall be equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Commitment at such time and the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Commitment at such time (in each case, as the Commitments and the Aggregate Commitment are adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) and the “Aggregate Commitment” under the Primary Credit Agreement (as so adjusted) at such time (or, if the Aggregate Commitment has been terminated, a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at such time and the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at such time and the “Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure” under the Primary Credit Agreement at such time). 

(c) No reduction of the “Extended Commitment” of any Lender under the Primary Credit Agreement shall be made unless the Commitment of such Lender shall be simultaneously ratably reduced. 

3 

* * *

(d) No payment of interest on any “Revolving Loan”, and no payment of fees, shall be made under the Primary Credit Agreement unless a simultaneous ratable payment is made of interest on the Corresponding Loan of the same Lender hereunder or of fees hereunder. 

(e) No assignment shall be made of any “Extended Commitment” of any Lender, or of any Loans made pursuant to such a Commitment or any rights or interests related thereto, under the Primary Credit Agreement unless a ratable assignment is made of the Extended Commitment of such Lender, and of the corresponding Loans made pursuant to such Commitment and the corresponding rights or interests, under this Agreement. 

(f) The Borrower Sublimits shall apply on a combined basis to borrowings and other extensions of credit under both Credit Agreements. 

(g) Borrowing and prepayment minimums and multiples shall apply on a combined basis to borrowings and prepayments under both Credit Agreements. 

(h) No amendment shall be made to one Credit Agreement without a corresponding amendment to the other. Voting shall be separate under the two Credit Agreements, but any matter approved by the “Required Lenders” under the Primary Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders under this Agreement. 

(i) A single promissory note will evidence the obligations of each Borrower under both Credit Agreements. 

(j) The Agent and the Borrowers shall be authorized to make such other amendments as they shall deem advisable to implement the intent that the Lenders under this Agreement will have the same rights and benefits, on a ratable basis, as Consenting Lenders under the Primary Credit Agreement. 

4.2. After the Commitment Termination Date. Upon the termination of the Non-Extended Commitments on the Commitment Termination Date, (a) all the “Commitments” and “Credit Extensions” hereunder (together with all amounts accrued or owing in respect thereof or otherwise under this Agreement) shall be deemed to be outstanding under the Primary Credit Agreement, (b) each of the “Aggregate Commitment” and the “Commitment Schedule” under and as defined in the Primary Credit Agreement will be automatically amended to reflect the addition of the Commitments hereunder and (c) this Agreement shall terminate.
