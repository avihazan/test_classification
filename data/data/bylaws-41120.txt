Capital Stock

The aggregate number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation has authority to issue is 101,000,000, of which 100,000,000 are to be shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and of which 1,000,000 are to be shares of serial preferred stock, $.01 par value per share. The aggregate par value of all shares of capital stock is $1,010,000. All of such shares are initially classified as common stock. The shares may be issued by the Corporation from time to time as approved by the board of directors of the Corporation without the approval of the stockholders except as otherwise as provided in this Article VI or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares shall be paid to or received by the Corporation in full before their issuance and shall not be less than the par value per share. The consideration for the issuance of the shares, other than cash, shall be determined by the board of directors in accordance with the General Laws of the State of Maryland. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board of directors as to the value of such consideration shall be conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, the part of the surplus of the Corporation which is transferred to stated capital upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend shall be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.

A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the Corporation’s capital stock, and a statement of the relative powers, designations, preferences and rights of the shares of each class and series (if any) of capital stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, are as follows:

Common Stock. Except as provided in these Articles, the holders of the common stock shall exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder.

Whenever there shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends, the full amount of dividends and sinking fund or retirement fund or other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends may be paid on the common stock, and on any class or series of stock entitled to participate therewith as to dividends, out of any assets legally available for the payment of dividends, but only as declared by the board of directors of the Corporation.

In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after there shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class having preference over the common stock in any such event, the full preferential amounts to which they are respectively entitled, the holders of the common stock and of any class or series of stock entitled to participate therewith, in whole or in part, as to distribution of assets shall be entitled, after payment or provisions for payment of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation, to receive the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution, in cash or in kind.

Each share of common stock shall have the same relative powers, preferences and rights as, and shall be identical in all respects with, all of the other shares of common stock the Corporation.

Serial Preferred Stock. Except as provided in these Articles, the board of directors of the Corporation is authorized, by resolution or resolutions from time to time adopted, to provide for the issuance of serial preferred stock in series and to fix and state the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including, but not limited to determination of any of the following:

1\. the distinctive designation and the number of shares constituting such class or series;

2\. the dividend rates or the amount of dividends to be paid on the shares of such class or series, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates, the payment date or dates for dividends, and the participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends;

7\. whether the shares of such class or series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation and, if so convertible or exchangeable, the conversion price or prices, or the rate or rates of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;

8\. the subscription or purchase price and form of consideration for which the shares of such class or series shall be issued;

9\. whether the shares of such class or series which are redeemed or converted shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares of serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares of the same or any other class or series; and

Each such notice given by a stockholder to the secretary of the Corporation with respect to business proposals to bring before a meeting shall set forth in writing as to each matter: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, of the stockholder proposing such business; (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these Articles to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article X.

C. The chairman of the annual or special meeting of stockholders may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to such meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination or proposal shall be disregarded and laid over for action at the next succeeding adjourned, special or annual meeting of the stockholders taking place thirty days or more thereafter. This provision shall not require the holding of any adjourned or special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of considering such defective nomination or proposal.

ARTICLE XI

Directors

A. Number; Vacancies. The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such number, not less than 5 nor more than 15 (exclusive of directors, if any, to be elected by holders of preferred stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a class), as shall be provided from time to time in or in accordance with the bylaws, provided that no decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director, and provided further that no action shall be taken to decrease or increase the number of directors from time to time unless at least two-thirds of the directors then in office shall concur in said action. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class of preferred stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled by a majority vote of the stockholders or the directors then in office. A director so chosen by the stockholders shall hold office for the balance of the term then remaining. A director so chosen by the remaining directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders, at which time the stockholders shall elect a director to hold office for the balance of the time then remaining.

B. Classified Board. At the first annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the board of directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as the then total number of directors constituting the entire board of directors shall permit, which classes shall be designated Class I, Class II and Class III. At such annual meeting of stockholders, directors assigned to Class I shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the first succeeding annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, directors assigned to Class II shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting thereafter, and directors assigned to Class III shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting thereafter. Thereafter, at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, directors of classes the terms of which expire at such annual meeting shall be elected for terms of three years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director whose term shall expire at any annual meeting shall continue to serve until such time as his successor shall have been duly elected and shall have qualified unless his position on the board of directors shall have been abolished by action taken to reduce the size of the board of directors prior to said meeting.

Should the number of directors of the Corporation be reduced, the directorship(s) eliminated shall be allocated among classes as appropriate so that the number of directors in each class is as specified in the immediately preceding paragraph. The board of directors shall designate, by the name of the incumbent(s), the position(s) to be abolished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. Should the number of directors of the Corporation be 

5

* * *

increased, the additional directorships shall be allocated among classes as appropriate so that the number of directors in each class is as specified in the immediately preceding paragraph.

Whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the board of directors shall consist of said directors so elected in addition to the number of directors fixed as provided above in this Article XI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise may be required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the terms of the director or directors elected by such holders shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.

ARTICLE XII

Removal of Directors

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles or the bylaws of the Corporation or the Maryland General Corporation Law, any director or the entire board of directors of the Corporation may be removed, at any time, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the preceding provisions of this Article XII shall not apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred stock.

ARTICLE XIII

Acquisition of Capital Stock

A. Five-Year Prohibition. For a period of five years from the effective date of the completion or the conversion of Cecil Federal Savings Bank from mutual to stock form (which entity shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation upon such conversion), no person shall directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Corporation, unless such offer or acquisition shall have been approved in advance by a majority vote of the Continuing Directors, as defined in Article XIV. In addition, for a period of five years from the completion of the conversion of Cecil Federal Savings Bank from mutual to stock form (which-entity shall become a wholly owned subsidiary. of the Corporation upon such conversion), and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Articles or in the bylaws of the Corporation, where any person directly or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Corporation in violation of this Article XIII, the securities beneficially owned in excess of 10% shall not be counted as shares entitled to vote, shall not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares in connection with any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, and shall not be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum or the affirmative vote necessary to approve any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote.

B. Prohibition after Five Years. If, at any time after five years from the effective date of the completion of the conversion of Cecil Federal Savings Bank from mutual to stock form (which entity shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation upon such conversion), any person shall acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Corporation without the prior approval by a majority vote of the Continuing Directors, as defined in Article XIV, then the record holders of voting stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such acquiring person shall have only the voting rights set forth in this paragraph B on any matter requiring the vote or consent of shareholders. With respect to each vote in excess of 10% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation which such record holders would otherwise be entitled to cast without giving effect to this paragraph B, the record holders in the aggregate shall be entitled to cast only one-hundredth of a vote, and the aggregate voting power of such record holders, so limited for all shares of voting stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such acquiring person, shall be allocated 

6

* * *

proportionately among such record holders. For each such record holder, this allocation shall be accomplished by multiplying the aggregate voting power, as so limited. of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such acquiring person by a fraction whose numerator is the number of votes represented by the shares of voting stock of the Corporation and whose denominator is the total number of votes represented by the shares of voting stock of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by such acquiring person. A person who is a record owner of shares of voting stock of the Corporation that are beneficially owned simultaneously by more than one person shall have, with respect to such shares, the right to cast the least number of votes that such person would be entitled to cast under this paragraph B by virtue of such shares being so beneficially owned by any of such acquiring persons.

C. Definitions. The term “person” means an individual, a group acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a syndicate or any other group acting in concert formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities of the Corporation. The term “acquire” includes every type of acquisition, whether effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise. The term group “acting in concert” includes (a) knowing participation in a joint activity or conscious parallel action towards a common goal whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, and (b) a combination or pooling of voting or other interest in the Corporation’s outstanding shares for a common purpose, pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise. The term “beneficial ownership” shall have the meaning defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the date of filing of these Articles.

D. Exclusion for Employee Benefit Plans, Directors, Officers, Employees and Certain Proxies. The restrictions contained in this Article XIII shall not apply to (i) any underwriter or member of an underwriting or selling group involving a public sale or resale of securities of the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof; provided. However, that upon completion of the sale or resale of such securities, no such underwriter or member of such selling group is a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Corporation, (ii) any proxy granted to one or more Continuing Directors, as defined in Article XIV, by a stockholder of the Corporation or (iii) any employee benefit plans of the Corporation. In addition, the Continuing Directors of the Corporation, the officers and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the directors of subsidiaries of the Corporation, the employee benefit plans of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, entities organized or established by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof pursuant to the terms of such plans and trustees and fiduciaries with respect to such plans acting in such capacity shall not be deemed to be a group with respect to their beneficial ownership of voting stock of the Corporation solely by virtue of their being directors, officers or employees of the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof or by virtue of the Continuing Directors of the Corporation, the officers and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and the directors of subsidiaries of the Corporation being fiduciaries or beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan of the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no director, officer or employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or group of any of them shall be exempt from the provisions of this Article XIII should any such person or group become a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Corporation,

E. Determinations. A majority of the Continuing Directors, as defined in Article XIV, shall have the power to construe and apply the provisions of this Article XIII and to make all determinations necessary or desirable to implement such provisions, including but not limited to matters with respect to (a) the number of shares beneficially owned by any person, (b) whether a person has an agreement, arrangement or understanding with another as to the matters referred to in the definition of beneficial ownership, (c) the application of any other definition or operative provision of this Article XIII to the given facts or (d) any other matter relating to the applicability or effect of this Article XIII. Any constructions, applications, or determinations made by the Continuing Directors pursuant to this Article XIII in good faith and on the basis of such information and assistance as was then reasonably available for such purpose shall be conclusive and binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders.
