## 6. Termination Following Change of Control.

### a. Definitions:

#### i. Detrimental Change in Duties is defined as (A) without Enloe’s written consent, a significant and material reduction in duties, titles, working conditions or responsibilities solely caused by a Change of Control; (B) changes in reporting relationship such that Enloe is no longer directly reporting to the Board or the board of directors of the successor of Trinity; or (C) a material breach of this Agreement by Trinity, or its successor, as applicable.

#### ii. Change of Control is defined as the occurrence of any of the following:

##### (A) the consummation of the acquisition by any person (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Trinity;

##### (B) the individuals who, as of the Effective Date, are members of the Board (the “Continuing Directors”) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board, unless the election, or nomination for election by the stockholders of Trinity, of any new director was approved by a vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors, and such new director shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be considered as a Continuing Director; or

##### (C) consummation by Trinity of: (I) a merger or consolidation if the stockholders of Trinity, immediately before such merger or consolidation, do not, as a result of such merger or consolidation, own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty 

5

##### percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the entity resulting from such merger or consolidation; or (II) a complete liquidation or dissolution or an agreement for the sale or other disposition of two-thirds or more of the consolidated assets of Trinity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because (x) fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of Trinity is acquired by a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one or more employee benefit plans maintained for employees of the Trinity or its Affiliates; or (y) the transaction is a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of Trinity in which no “person,” as defined above, acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of Trinity’s then-outstanding securities.

### b. Cure Period. Enloe shall provide Trinity, or its successor, as applicable, with advance written notice of his intention to terminate his employment pursuant to a Detrimental Change in Duties specifying the condition causing the Detrimental Change in Duties and Trinity, or is successor, as applicable, shall have ten (10) days to cure the specified condition.

### c. Tax Limitations. If it is determined that any payment or distribution from Trinity, any Affiliate (as defined below), or trusts established by the Trinity or by any Affiliate to or for the benefit of Enloe (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, and with a “payment” including, without limitation, the vesting or payment of non-cash benefits or property) (a “Payment”) would be nondeductible by Trinity or its successor, as applicable, for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision, then the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit of Enloe pursuant to this Agreement (“Agreement Payments”) shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. For purposes of this section, the “Reduced Amount” shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to be nondeductible because of said Section 280G of the Code. The determination to be made hereunder shall be made within twenty (20) days after the date of termination by the accounting firm for Trinity (the “Accounting Firm”), which shall provide detailed calculations thereof to Trinity and to Enloe, provided, however, that Enloe shall elect which and how much of the Agreement Payments shall be reduced consistent with such calculations. The determination to be made by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Trinity and Enloe. For purposes of this Agreement, Trinity’s “Affiliates” include each company, corporation, partnership, 

6

## 7. Termination by Reason of Enloe’s Disability or Death. Enloe’s employment may be terminated upon the event of his death or the good faith determination of the Board of his Disability as defined herein.

### a. Disability is defined as: (i) Enloe is permanently and totally disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months; (ii) Enloe’s limitation due to sickness or injury, in performance of the material and substantive duties of his position for a period of six (6) consecutive months; or (iii) Enloe is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees.

## 8. Termination for Non-Renewal of the Agreement. Should Trinity determine not to renew this Agreement following the Initial Term or any applicable Renewal Term, Enloe’s employment shall terminate on the last date of the then-current Term. In order to terminate through non-renewal, Trinity must serve notice upon Enloe not later than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current Term. No amounts shall be made upon termination due to non-renewal of this Agreement, provided, however, that if a Change of Control shall occur within six (6) months of the termination due of non-renewal of the Agreement then Trinity, or is successor as applicable, shall pay Enloe such amounts as are payable pursuant to a Termination due to Change of Control as provided in Section D.6.

## 9. Specified Employee. If at the time of any payment hereunder: (a) Enloe is considered to be a “specified employee” as that term is or may be, defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”); and (b) such payment is required to be treated as deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, then no such payment may be made before the date which is six (6) months after the date of separation from service.

## 10. Release of Employment Claims. Enloe agrees, as a condition to receipt of the payments and benefits provided in Section D, that he will execute a comprehensive release, releasing any and all claims arising out of his employment (other than enforcement of this Agreement and his rights under any of Trinity’s incentive compensation and employee benefit plans and programs to which he is entitled under this Agreement) upon termination from the Companies for any reason.

## 11. Consultation Services. Subsequent to Enloe’s termination of employment for reasons other than for Cause, death or disability, beginning thirty (30) days thereafter and as a precondition to entitlement to receive amounts as provided in Section D herein, Enloe shall keep himself at all times reasonably available for a period of twelve (12) months to render such services of any advisory or consultative nature as the Board shall reasonably require. Trinity shall not be entitled to call upon Enloe for more than one-hundred (100) hours in such twelve (12) month period.

# E. Conduct, Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

## 1. Conduct in Conformance with the Code of Conduct. At all times during the Term of this Agreement, Enloe shall engage in behavior consistent with Trinity’s then-current Code of Conduct and shall not engage in any activities that may disparage the business or any employee or director of Trinity or its Affiliates. Enloe agrees to avoid any situation which may cause a conflict of interest or which could appear to cause a conflict of interest. Enloe further agrees to notify the Board of any potential relationships in which he may have a conflict of interest so that appropriate measures may be taken to ensure all transactions are conducted at an arm’s length. Enloe agrees that the duty to refrain from any conduct disparaging to Trinity and its Affiliates, and its and their employees or directors shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

## 2. Confidentiality. Enloe acknowledges that Trinity and its Affiliates possess substantial confidential information which is proprietary to Trinity and its Affiliates and the confidentiality and exclusive use of which by Trinity and its Affiliates is essential to the continuing success of Trinity and Enloe’s services for the Companies will bring him into close contact with additional confidential information which has not been made know to the public. In order to induce Trinity to enter into this Agreement, Enloe hereby covenants and agrees to promptly deliver to Trinity upon termination of his employment, or at any time Trinity may so request, all memoranda, notes, lists (including customer lists), records, reports manuals, drawings, and other documents (and all copies thereof) relating to the Companies’ business and all property associated therewith which he may then possess or which are then under his control. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

## 3. Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation. In consideration for this Agreement, Enloe agrees that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) 

8

  


* * *

### a. Enloe will not approach clients, customers or contacts of the Companies or other persons or entities introduced to Enloe in his capacity as a representative of the Companies for the purposes of doing business with such persons or entities and will not interfere with the business relationship between the Companies and such persons and/or entities;

### b. Unless expressly consented to by Trinity in writing, Enloe shall not assume employment with or provide services, directly or indirectly, as a director, consultant or otherwise for any competitor of the Companies within any county in which any one of the Companies conducts business, or engage, whether as a principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, in any business which is in direct or indirect competition with the business of the Companies; provided, however, that nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall be deemed to prohibit Enloe from acquiring, solely as an investment, shares of capital stock of any corporation the shares of the same class of which corporation are traded on the national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long as he does not acquire direct or indirect ownership of one percent (1%) or more of any class of capital stock of said corporation; and

### c. Unless expressly consented to by Trinity in writing, Enloe will not seek directly or indirectly, or offer alternative employment or other inducement whatsoever, in order to solicit the services of any employee of the Companies employed as of the date of termination of his employment or this Agreement for any reason, or employed at any time during the twelve (12) months preceding such termination.

## 4. Severability. The provisions provided in Section E.3 shall be separate and severable and enforceable independently of each other and independent of any other provision of this Agreement. The provisions contained in Section E.3 are considered reasonable by the parties and consideration for such covenants is hereby acknowledged, but, in the event that any such provision should be found to be void under the laws of the State of New Mexico but would be valid if some portion thereof were removed or the area of applicability were reduced, such provisions shall apply with such modification as may be imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in order to make them valid and enforceable.

## 1. Within 15 days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator and the two selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten days of their appointment.
