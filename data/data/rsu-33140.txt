# 4\. Capital Adjustments. The number of Covered Shares and the Option Price shall be subject to such adjustment, if any, in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Plan.

# 5\. Method of Exercise.

## A. Notice. The Option shall be exercised, in whole or in part, by the delivery to XM of written notice of such exercise, in such form as the Committee may from time to time prescribe, accompanied by:

### c. such representations and documents as the corporation, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and any other Federal or State securities laws or regulations. XM may, in its absolute discretion, also take whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to effect such compliance, including, without limitation placing legends on share certificates and issuing stop-transfer orders to transfer agents and registrars; and

### d. if the Option or portion thereof shall be exercised pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.C of this Agreement by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option or portion thereof.

Until the Committee notifies the Optionee to the contrary, the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A shall be used to exercise the Option.

# 6\. Compliance with Law; Disposition of Shares of Common Stock Issued Upon Exercise.

## A. Compliance with Law: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Optionee agrees, for himself or herself and his or her successors, that XM shall not be required to honor the exercise of the Option if XM does not have in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the offer of Shares to the Optionee under the Plan, if XM reasonably determines that the exercise of such Option would violate the Securities Act. The Optionee further agrees, for himself or herself and his or her successors, that upon the issuance of any Shares upon the exercise of the Option, he or she will, upon the request of the XM, agree in writing that he or she is acquiring the Shares for investment only and not with a view to resale, and that he or she will not sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of such shares so issued, unless and until (a) XM is furnished with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to XM to the effect that registration of such shares pursuant to the Securities Act is not required by that Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (b) the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a “no-action” letter with respect to such disposition; or (c) such registration or notification as is, in the opinion of counsel for the corporation, required for the lawful disposition of such shares has been filed by XM and has become effective; provided, however, that XM is not obligated hereby to file any such registration or notification.

## The Optionee further agrees that so long as the Optionee is an employee of XM he or she will only sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of such shares issued upon the exercise of the Option in accordance with all insider trading policies of XM then in effect. The present version of XM’s policy requires approval of transfers by certain categories of employees, and notice and certification by other employees. An approval or notification form based on the current plan is attached for Optionee’s convenience, although Optionee is responsible for completing different or other forms if then required by XM’s policy.

## B. Disposition or Transfer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Optionee agrees, for himself or herself and his or her successors, that he or she will not sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of shares issued upon the exercise of the Option until the first to occur of the following: (i) the average closing price for the Shares on the Nasdaq National Market system, or principal stock exchange on which the Shares are then listed, over the any 20 consecutive trading days following the Date of Grant equals or exceeds $10, or (ii) seven years have elapsed since the Date of Grant. If Optionee intends to dispose of shares issued upon the exercise of the Option, Optionee will provide to XM a written notice describing the proposed transfer and indicating which of the prior clauses has been satisfied.

# 7\. Representations and Warranties. Upon exercise of the Option in whole or in part, if the shares underlying the option shall not then be registered under the Securities Act, the Optionee shall represent, warrant and acknowledge the following:

## A. The Optionee has made such investigations as the Optionee deems necessary and appropriate of the business and/or financial prospects of XM.

* * *

  


## B. The Option is being exercised and the Covered Shares are being acquired for investment for the Optionee’s own account and not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, and the certificate for such stock may be legended to that effect, that such stock is not registered under federal or state securities laws and that the registration exemptions being relied on are the federal and state private or limited offering exemptions and the Optionee has no reason to believe that such exemptions are not applicable to the Optionee.

## C. The Optionee acknowledges that XM has made available to the Optionee the opportunity to obtain information to evaluate the merits and risks associated with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Optionee acknowledges that the investment contemplated by the Option involves a high degree of risk, including risks associated with XM’s business operations and prospects including competition and the dependence on XM’s technology and events beyond XM’s control, the limits on transferability of the Option and Covered Shares, and the absence of a public market for the Covered Shares.

# 8\. Rights as Stockholder. The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Covered Shares subject to the Option until and unless a certificate or certificates representing such shares are issued to the Optionee pursuant to this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of such certificate or certificates.

# 9\. Employment. Neither the granting of the Option evidenced by this Agreement nor any term or provision of this Agreement shall constitute or be evidence of any understanding, express or implied, on the part of XM to employ or continue the employment of the Optionee for any period. Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to the employment of the Optionee, it means employment by XM or its affiliates.

# 10\. Subject to the Plan. The Option evidenced by this Agreement and the exercise of the Option are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, but the terms of the Plan shall not be considered an enlargement of any benefits under this Agreement. In addition, the Option is subject to any rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee.

# 11\. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, following a Public Offering, award exercises and issuances involving the issuance of Shares may only be effected in whole (and not fractional) shares.

# 12\. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

# 13\. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is in lieu of and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, negotiations, or other understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It may not be amended or altered except in a writing signed by the Optionee and the authorized representatives of XM.

5

* * *

  


# 14\. Waiver and Severability.

## A. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of the same or any other breach by either of the parties to this Agreement, whether prior or subsequent.

## B. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the legality, validity, or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not thereby be affected, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent necessary to delete such provision.

# 15\. Headings. The Section, paragraph, and subparagraph headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
