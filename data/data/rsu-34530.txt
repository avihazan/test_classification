1\. 

Option Grant and Exercise Period. The Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee an Incentive Stock Option ("Option") to purchase, pursuant to the Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), and upon the terms and conditions therein and hereinafter set forth, an aggregate of ________ shares (the "Option Shares") of the common stock of the Corporation ("Common Stock") at the price of _______ per share (the "Exercise Price").

subject to Section 3 below, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the Optionee or other person exercising this Option a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Common Stock so purchased, registered in the name of the Optionee (or such other person), or, upon request, in the name of the Optionee (or such other person) and in the name of another in such form of joint ownership as requested by the Optionee (or such other person) pursuant to applicable state law. 

  
  
  
3.

Delivery and Registration of Shares of Common Stock The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock hereunder shall, if the Committee so requests, be conditioned upon the Optionee's compliance with the terms and provisions of Section 11 of the Plan.   
  
4.

Nontransferability of This Option. This Option may not be assigned, encumbered, transferred, pledged or hypothecated except, in the event of the death of the Optionee, by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution to the extent provided in Section 5 below. This Option is exercisable during the Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee or a person acting with the legal authority of the Optionee. The provisions of this Option shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto, the successors and assigns of the Corporation and any person acting with the legal authority of the Optionee or to whom this Option is transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.   
  
5.

Termination of Service or Death of the Optionee. Except as provided in this Section 5 and Section 9 below, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Option to the contrary, this Option shall be exercisable only if the Optionee has not incurred a Termination of Service at the time of such exercise.   
  
If the Optionee incurs a Termination of Service for any reason excluding death and Termination of Service for Cause, the Optionee may, but only within the period of three months (or one year in the case of disability, as defined in Section 22(e) (3) of the Code) immediately succeeding such Termination of Service and in no event after the Expiration Date, exercise this Option to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise this Option on the date of Termination of Service. If the Optionee incurs a Termination of Service for Cause, all rights under this Option shall expire immediately upon the giving to the Optionee of notice of his termination, except as provided in Section 9 below. 

In the event of the death of the Optionee prior to the Optionee's Termination of Service or during the three-month period referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, the person or persons to whom the Option has been transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution may, but only to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise this Option on the date of the Optionee's death, exercise this Option at any time within one year following the death of the Optionee, but in no event after the Expiration Date. Following the death of the Optionee, the Committee may, in its sale discretion, as an alternative means of settlement of this Option, elect to pay to the person to whom this Option is transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, the amount by which the Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of this Option shall exceed the Exercise Price per Option Share, multiplied by the number of Option Shares with respect to which this Option is properly exercised. Any such settlement of this Option shall be considered an exercise of this Option for all purposes of this Option and of the Plan.   
  
6.

Notice of Sale. The Optionee or any person to whom the Option Shares shall have been transferred shall promptly give notice to the Corporation in the event of the sale or other disposition of Option Shares within the later of (i) two years from the Grant Date or (ii) one year from the date of exercise of this Option. Such notice shall specify the number of Option Shares sold or otherwise disposed of and be directed to the address set forth in Section 12 below.   
  
7.

Such amount may be payable fully in cash, fully in one or more of the kind or kinds of property payable in such merger, consolidation or combination, or partly in cash and partly in one or more of such kind or kinds of property, all in the discretion of the Committee.
