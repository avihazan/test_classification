“The registered holder of the shares represented by this certificate, at the time of issuance hereof, may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Corporation under the Securities Act of 1933. Such securities may not be sold, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or transferred in the absence of an effective registration statement covering such transaction under such laws or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Corporation that such registration is not required.”

If, prior to a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan) occurring after the date of this Agreement or prior to the death of Director, the employment of Director with the Corporation and its subsidiaries terminates for any reason (other than due to the death of Director), all of the Shares that are not vested under Section 4 as of the date of termination shall be forfeited to the Corporation (such event being referred to herein as a “Forfeiture Event”). Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Event, Director shall return for cancellation all stock certificates representing unvested Shares, and irrespective of whether such stock certificates are so returned and cancelled, all unvested Shares shall automatically, without further action, be cancelled and shall no longer be issued and outstanding.
