1. NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT

Grantee’s Name:

Kenneth A. Sexton  
  
You have been granted restricted shares of the Common Stock of the Company (“Restricted Shares”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Stock Agreement, as follows:

August 22, 2002  
  
Vesting Commencement Date:

June 24, 2002  
  
Total Number of Restricted Shares Granted:

100,000   
  
Vesting Schedule and Forfeiture:

25% of the total number of the Restricted Shares shall vest twelve months after the Vesting Commencement Date, and 1/36th of the total remaining number of the Restricted Shares shall vest each month thereafter, provided that Restricted Shares actually will vest on any such date only if the Grantee is a Service Provider on such date.

If your service terminates for any reason, then the Restricted Shares will be forfeited to the extent that they have not vested before the termination date and do not vest as a result of the termination. This means that the Restricted Shares will immediately revert to the Company. No payment by the Company will be due to Grantee for Restricted Shares that are forfeited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Restricted Stock Agreement, the vesting of the Restricted Shares shall be accelerated to the same extent as the stock options, as described in the Employment Agreement between you and the Company, dated July 19, 2002.
