Plan

All capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the Plan, the text of which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In case of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:

Number of Shares  
and Exercise Price

To the extent vested (and prior to the end of the Term described above), this Option gives you the right to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the cover page, at the Exercise Price set forth in the cover page.  
  
The Exercise Price is subject to Section 6 of the Plan and to Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that the Exercise Price may not be less than the Fair Market Value (or, if this Option is an Incentive Stock Option and you are a 10% Stockholder, 110% of the Fair Market Value) of the Shares on the Date of Option Grant.  
  
The number of Shares and/or Exercise Price may be adjusted to reflect a stock split or other corporate transaction or event, in the sole discretion of the Committee.  
  
Vesting

The cover page indicates the criteria for vesting.   
  
With respect to any portion of this Option that vests according to the Vesting Schedule set forth in the cover page, a leave of absence shall not count as service, except as required by law.  
  
In addition, this Option shall vest upon the occurrence of any vesting event (for example, onset of Disability or a change in control of the Company) set forth in a separate written agreement between you and the Company.  
  
Special Provisions  
for Incentive Stock  
Options

If this Option is an Incentive Stock Option, the following provisions apply:  
  


• Although the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, the Company does not warrant that the Option will be treated as an Incentive Stock Option for tax purposes. To the extent that the Option fails for any reason to satisfy the requirements applicable to Incentive Stock Options, the Option shall be a Non-qualified Stock Option.  
  
• The Option will not be treated as an Incentive Stock Option for tax purposes if you sell or otherwise dispose of Shares issued upon exercise before the later of: (i) the first anniversary of the date the Shares are delivered to you, or (ii) the second anniversary of the Date of Option Grant. Any earlier sale or disposition of the Shares will be a “disqualifying disposition.” You must notify the Company of any disqualifying disposition within 30 days after a disqualifying disposition occurs.  
  
• Any portion of the Option that is exercised more than three months after your Termination of Service for any reason other than Disability or death (to the extent the Option has not expired) shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. In case of Termination of Service due to Disability, the three-month period shall be extended to 12 months. If you die before exercising the Option, it may be treated as an Incentive Stock Option only to the extent that the Option would have been treated as an Incentive Stock Option if you had exercised it on the date of your death.  
  
Exercise

To exercise this Option, you (or your Beneficiary, in the case of exercise after your death) must complete a Notice of Exercise, which may be written or electronic, and file it at the address shown on the form. Your Notice of Exercise must indicate the number of Shares you wish to purchase and will not be accepted if it is incomplete. You may not purchase fractional Shares: any request for fractional Shares will be rounded down to the next lowest whole number of Shares.  
  
A sample Notice of Exercise appears as Appendix A to this Agreement.  
  
You will not have any of the rights of a Stockholder with respect to the Shares under this Agreement until (1) you exercise the Option, (2) the Company receives full payment for the Shares, and (3) the Shares are transferred to you.

Payment Upon  
Exercise

When you (or your Beneficiary) submit your Notice of Exercise, you must include payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares you are purchasing. (You might also have to include payment for tax withholding, as described below.) Unless otherwise approved by the Committee, payment for the Shares must be made by cash or check. With approval from the Committee, however, payment may be made in either of the following additional forms:  
  
• Tender or Attestation of Shares: You may tender whole Shares to the Company with a Fair Market Value equal to the Exercise Price. Instead of actually tendering Shares to the Company, you may attest that you own Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the Exercise Price, and the Company will reduce the number of Shares issuable upon exercise by the number of Shares required to cover the Exercise Price. Shares attested to or tendered in order to pay the Exercise Price may not be Restricted Stock, and you must have owned the Shares for at least six months.  
  
• Broker-Assisted Cashless Exercise: You may instruct the Company to deliver the Shares issuable upon exercise to a broker (acceptable to the Company); you must give the broker irrevocable instructions to sell enough Shares to pay the Exercise Price and to deliver the Exercise Price to the Company. For purposes of a broker-assisted cashless exercise, the Shares are deemed to have a Fair Market Value on the Option exercise date equal to the price at which the broker sold the Shares to pay the Exercise Price. (Because of the rules prohibiting them from receiving loans or other extensions of credit from the Company, directors and executive officers of the Company are not eligible to use the cashless exercise method.)  
  
All or part of the Option is deemed exercised when the Committee receives (i) your (or your Beneficiary’s) Notice of Exercise and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.  
  
The Committee or the Company may for any reason decline to accept payment by exchange of Shares, or may impose such limitations or restrictions on the form of payment as it deems advisable.  
  
Withholding

If you received the Option as an employee of the Company, the Company must withhold income and employment taxes when you (or your Beneficiary) exercise the Option. The Company may either (i) require you (or your Beneficiary) to remit to the Company cash and/or Shares in an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, and local withholding obligations, or (ii) upon your request and with approval from the Committee, withhold Shares that would otherwise be delivered.   
  
As set forth in Section 15 of the Plan, you remain responsible at all times for paying any federal, state, and local income and employment taxes with respect to this Option. NationsHealth is not responsible for any liability or penalty that you incur by failing to make timely payments of tax.  
  
Nontransferability

Unless the Committee determines otherwise, you may not transfer the Option, except pursuant to a will or in accordance with the laws of descent or distribution. However, if approved by the Committee (subject to terms and conditions that the Committee may establish), and provided that this Option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, you may transfer all or part of the Option to a member of your immediate family (i.e., spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or sibling).

Restrictions on  
Exercise, Delivery,  
and Resale

You may not exercise this Option or sell any Shares acquired under this Option at a time when the exercise or sale would be prohibited under Applicable Laws.  
  
You may not exercise this Option after an event constituting “Cause” (as defined in the following section) occurs, unless you are notified by the Committee your right to exercise has been reinstated.  
  
Shares shall not be delivered until (i) all conditions of this Agreement have been met to the satisfaction of the Committee, (ii) all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of the Shares have been satisfied, and (iii) you have executed and delivered all representations and agreements as are necessary and appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any Applicable Laws.  
  
If you are terminated for Cause, the Company has the right and option to repurchase all or any portion of the Issued Shares received by the exercise of the Option. The per share purchase price of the Issued Shares subject to the repurchase shall be equal to the Exercise Price.  
  
Forfeiture Upon  
Termination of  
Service for Cause

If you experience a Termination of Service that is initiated by the Company for “Cause” (as defined below), this Option (whether vested or not vested) shall immediately expire and shall be null and void.  
  
If you are covered by an employment agreement or consulting agreement at the time of your Termination of Service, and if the employment agreement or consulting agreement includes provisions relating to termination for cause, your termination for cause within the meaning of the employment agreement or consulting agreement shall constitute a Termination of Service for “Cause” within the meaning of this Agreement.  
  
If you are not covered by an employment agreement or consulting agreement that includes provisions relating to termination for cause, “Cause” shall mean (i) any breach or violation by you of any agreement between you and the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) any act or omission to act by you that would be reasonably likely to have the effect of injuring the reputation, business, or business relationships of the Company, or of impairing your ability to perform services for the Company or an Affiliate; (iii) your conviction (including without limitation a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of any crime other than an ordinary traffic violation; (iv) any material misconduct or willful and deliberate non-performance of duties by you in connection with the Company’s or an Affiliate’s business or affairs; (v) your theft, dishonesty, misrepresentation, or falsification of the Company’s or an Affiliate’s documents or records; (vi) your improper use or disclosure of the Company’s or an Affiliate’s confidential or proprietary information; or (vii) your use of the Company’s or an Affiliate’s facilities, premises, or property to conduct unlawful or unauthorized activities or transactions.  
  
Lock-up Provision

If the Company proposes to make a public offering of Shares, the Company or an underwriter might request that you do not sell or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of Shares delivered under this Agreement for a reasonable period after the offering, not to exceed 90 days. Your right to any Shares received under this Agreement is contingent on your agreeing to comply with such a request.  
  
Notices

Any notice from you to the Company must be in writing and shall be deemed effective when it is received by the Secretary of the Company at the Company’s principal office.  
  
Any notice from the Company to you must be in writing and shall be deemed effective when it is personally delivered to you or when it is deposited in the U.S. Mail, with postage and fees prepaid.
