(a) Termination without Cause or for Good Reason. If the Executive’s employment shall terminate without Cause pursuant to Subsection 6(a)(v) above, or for Good Reason pursuant to Section 6(a)(iv) above, the Company shall: 

(i) pay to the Executive, following the Date of Termination, an amount equal to the Annual Base Salary that the Executive would have been entitled to receive had he continued his employment hereunder for a period of 2 years (the “Severance Period”), such payment to be made as follows:

(B) if, within 18 months prior to the Date of Termination, a Corporate Transaction has occurred, then the Annual Base Salary amounts for the Severance Period shall be paid, at the Executive’s election, either in a lump sum within 30 days following the Date of Termination, or in the manner specified by Subsection 7(a)(i)(A) above;

##### 

(A) if, within 18 months prior to the Date of Termination, no Corporate Transaction has occurred, then the Discretionary Bonus shall be paid pro rata on a monthly basis over the duration of the Severance Period; or,  
(B) if, within 18 months prior to the Date of Termination, a Corporate Transaction has occurred, then the Discretionary Bonus for all portions of the Severance Period shall be paid, at the Executive’s election, either within 30 days following the Date of Termination, or in the manner specified by Subsection 7(a)(iii)(A) above; and  
  
(iv) continue, for the remainder of the Severance Period, the Executive’s coverage under all Company welfare benefit plans and programs in which the Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination, at the same premium cost, and at the same coverage level, as in effect immediately preceding the Date of Termination. However, in the event the premium cost shall change for all employees of the Company, or for management employees with respect to supplemental benefits, the cost shall change for the Executive in a corresponding manner.  
  
The payments required by Subsections 7(a)(i), 7(a)(ii), and, 7(a)(iii) above shall be in lieu of any payments to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled under the Company’s general severance policy pertaining to reductions in force. 

(b) Excise Tax Indemnification. With respect to any payment(s) made to the Executive under this Section 7 or otherwise and any accelerated vesting and/or exercise of stock options under any Company stock plan, and only in the event that any thereof result in the assertion by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that the Executive is liable under Section 280G and/or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) for the payment of an excise tax on so-called “excess parachute payments” under such Code sections, or for any other tax or imposition, however denominated, and whether federal, state, or local, in addition to or excess of ordinary income tax rates (any such tax being hereinafter referred to as an “EPP Tax”), then the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Executive from and against any such demand or assertion from the IRS or any other taxing authority, by (i) paying to the Executive an amount sufficient to cover both such asserted EPP Tax and any income or other tax payable by the Executive on or on account of receiving such indemnification payment, and/or (ii) at the Company’s sole election, contesting, at the Company’s expense and with counsel and/or other advisors of the Company’s choosing, the applicability or amount of such EPP Tax with the IRS or other taxing authority, in which event the Executive shall cooperate as reasonably requested by the Company in any such proceeding. 

(c) Survival. The expiration or termination of the Employment Period shall not impair the rights or obligations of any party hereto as existing or accrued through the Date of Termination.

Section 8. Competition.

(a) The Executive shall not, at any time during the Employment Period, and, if severance payments are made pursuant to Section 7 hereof, then also during the Severance Period, without the prior written consent of the Board, directly or indirectly engage in, or have any interest in or manage or operate any Competitor (as such term is defined in the last sentence of this Subsection 8(a)), whether such engagement occurs in the capacity of a director, officer, employee, agent, representative, partner, security holder, consultant, or otherwise; provided, however, that the Executive shall be permitted to acquire a stock interest in a Competitor which is a corporation provided such stock is publicly traded and the stock so acquired is not more than one percent of the outstanding shares of such corporation. As used in the preceding sentence, “Competitor” shall mean any business organization, whether in corporate, partnership, or other form, and whether located in the United States or elsewhere, which, as of the Executive’s Date of Termination, is established as a private-sector provider of ship repair, maintenance, overhaul, and/or modernization services. 

(b) In the event that the provisions of Subsection 8(a) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, then such provisions shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable, and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be enforceable, and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. 

Section 9. Nondisclosure of Proprietary Information.

(a) Except as required in the faithful performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder or pursuant to Subsection 9(c) below, the Executive shall, in perpetuity, maintain in confidence and shall not directly or indirectly use, disseminate, disclose, or publish, or use for his benefit or the benefit of any person, firm, corporation, or other entity any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of or relating to the Company, including, without limitation, information with respect to the Company’s operations, processes, products, inventions, business practices, finances, principals, vendors, suppliers, customers, potential customers, marketing methods, costs, prices, contractual relationships, regulatory sums, compensation paid to employees or other terms of employment, or deliver to any person, firm, corporation or other entity any document, record, notebook, computer program, or similar repository of or containing any such confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets. The parties hereby stipulate and agree that as between them the foregoing matters are important, material, confidential, and proprietary information and trade secrets and affect the successful conduct of the business of the Company.

##### 

(b) Upon termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company all correspondence, drawings, manuals, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, programs, plans, proposals, financial documents, or any other documents which either concern the Company’s customers, business plans, marketing strategies, products, or processes, or which contain proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company. 

(c) The Executive may respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process seeking any of the information or material referred to in Subsection 9(a) or 9(b) above, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, and shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought and shall assist such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. 

10\. Injunctive Relief.

The Executive recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of the covenants contained in Sections 8 and 9 would cause irreparable damage to the Company and its goodwill, the exact amount of which would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach would be inadequate. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections 8 and 9, in addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief. 

11\. Successors and Assigns.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Executive, and their respective successors, assigns, personnel and legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees, as applicable; provided, however, that the Executive acknowledges that this Agreement is a personal services contract and is therefore not assignable by the Executive. 

12\. Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia. 

13\. Validity.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of his Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

No such waiver shall operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other or subsequent failure. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy, or power hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise of such or any other right, remedy, or power provided herein or by law or in equity.

The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne by the Company.
