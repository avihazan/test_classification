8. Long-term Consideration for Award. The Participant recognizes and agrees that the Company's key consideration in granting this Award is securing the long-term commitment of the Participant to serve as a key employee who will advance and promote the business interests and objectives of the Company Group. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that this Award shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 25 of the Plan (relating to the termination, rescission and recapture if you violate certain commitments made therein to the Company Group), as well as to the following terms and conditions as material and indivisible consideration for this Award: 

(a) Fiduciary Duty. During his or her employment with the Company Group the Participant shall devote his or her full energies, abilities, attention and business time to the performance of his or her job responsibilities and shall not engage in any activity which conflicts or interferes with, or in any way compromises, his or her performance of such responsibilities. 

(b) Confidential Information. The Participant recognizes that by virtue of his or her employment with the Company Group, he or she will be granted otherwise prohibited access to confidential information and proprietary data which are not known, and not readily accessible to the competitors of the Company Group. This information (the "Confidential Information") includes, but is not limited to, current and prospective customers; the identity of key contacts at such customers; customers' particularized preferences and needs; marketing strategies and plans; financial data; personnel data; compensation data; proprietary procedures and processes; and other unique and specialized practices, programs and plans of the Company Group and their respective customers and prospective customers. The Participant recognizes that this Confidential Information constitutes a valuable property of the Company Group, developed over a significant period of time and at substantial expense. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that he or she shall not, at any time during or after his or her employment with the Company Group, divulge such Confidential Information or make use of it for his or her own purposes or the purposes of any person or entity other than the Company Group. 

(c) Non-Solicitation of Customers. The Participant recognizes that by virtue of his or her employment with the Company Group he or she will be introduced to and involved in the solicitation and servicing of existing customers of the Company Group and new customers obtained by the Company Group during his or her employment. The Participant understands and agrees that all efforts expended in soliciting and servicing such customers shall be for the permanent benefit of the Company Group. The Participant further agrees that during his or her employment with the Company Group the Participant will not engage in any conduct which could in any way jeopardize or disturb any of the customer relationships of the Company Group. The Participant also recognizes the legitimate interest of the Company Group in protecting, for a reasonable period of time after his or her employment with the Company Group, the customers of the Company Group. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that, for a period beginning on the date hereof and ending twelve (12) months after termination of Participant's employment with the Company Group, regardless of the reason for such termination, the Participant shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, market, offer, sell or otherwise furnish any products or services substantially similar to those offered by the Company Group to any customer of the Company Group. 

(d) Non-Solicitation of Employees. The Participant recognizes the substantial expenditure of time and effort which the Company Group devotes to the recruitment, hiring, orientation, training and retention of its employees. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that, for a period beginning on the date hereof and ending twenty four (24) months after termination of Participant's employment with the Company Group, regardless of the reason for such termination, the Participant shall not, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or on behalf of any other person or entity, solicit, offer employment to, hire or otherwise retain the services of any employee of the Company Group. For purposes of the foregoing, "employee of the Company Group" shall include any person who was

an employee of the Company Group at any time within six (6) months prior to the prohibited conduct. 

(e) Survival of Commitments; Potential Recapture of Award and Proceeds. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the terms and conditions of this Section regarding confidentiality and non-solicitation shall survive both (i) the termination of Participant's employment with the Company Group for any reason, and (ii) the termination of the Plan, for any reason. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the grant of Options in this Award Agreement is just and adequate consideration for the survival of the restrictions set forth herein, and that the Company Group may pursue any or all of the following remedies if the Participant either violates the terms of this Section or succeeds for any reason in invalidating any part of it (it being understood that the invalidity of any term of this Section would result in a failure of consideration for the Award): 

(i)
    declaration that the Award is null and void and of no further force or effect;   
  

(ii)
    recapture of any cash paid or Shares issued to the Participant, or any designee or beneficiary of the Participant, pursuant to the Award; and   
  

(iii)
    recapture of the proceeds, plus reasonable interest, with respect to any Shares that are both issued pursuant to this Award and sold or otherwise disposed of by the Participant, or any designee or beneficiary of the Participant. 



The remedies provided above are not intended to be exclusive, and the Company Group may seek such other remedies as are provided by law, including equitable relief. 

(f) Acknowledgement. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that his or her adherence to the foregoing requirements will not prevent him or her from engaging in his or her chosen occupation and earning a satisfactory livelihood following the termination of his or her employment with the Company Group.] 




9. Designation of Beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Plan, following the execution of this Award Agreement, you may expressly designate a beneficiary (the "Beneficiary") to your interest in the Option awarded hereby.

10. Restrictions on Transfer. This Award Agreement may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may transfer this Option if allowed under Section 1 for a Non-Incentive Stock Option (i) by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust (or other entity) in which each beneficiary is a permissible gift recipient, as such is set forth in subsection (ii) of this Section, or (ii) by gift to charitable institutions or by gift or transfer for consideration to any of the following relatives of the Participant (or to an inter vivos trust, testamentary trust or other entity primarily for the benefit of the following relatives of the Participant): any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships.

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Award Agreement and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control. 

19. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Delaware shall govern the validity of this Award Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. 

20. Not a Contract of Employment. By executing this Award Agreement you acknowledge and agree that (i) any person who is terminated before full vesting of an award, such as the one granted to you by this Award Agreement, could claim that he or she was terminated to preclude vesting; (ii) you promise never to make such a claim; (iii) nothing in this Award Agreement or the Plan confers on you any right to continue an employment, service or consulting relationship with the Company Group, nor shall this Award Agreement or the Plan affect in any way your right or the right of the Company Group, as applicable, to terminate your employment, service, or consulting relationship at any time, with or without Cause; and (iv) the Company would not have granted this Award to you but for these acknowledgements and agreements.
