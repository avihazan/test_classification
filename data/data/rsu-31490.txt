2\. Value of Performance Shares. Each Performance Share represents and has a value equal to one share of common stock (the “Shares” or “Stock”) of WGL Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”). 

3\. Performance Shares and Achievement of Total Shareholder Return Performance Measure. The number of Performance Shares to be earned under this Agreement is based upon the Company’s Total Shareholder Return as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the Company’s Peer Group (as identified in Exhibit A) during the Performance Period. 

For this purpose, Total Shareholder Return shall be determined as follows:   
  
Total Shareholder  
Return 

=  Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid  
Beginning Stock Price  
  
Beginning Stock Price means the average closing prices as reported on New York Stock Exchange of one share of the Company’s common stock for the thirty (30) trading days ending immediately prior to the first calendar day of the Performance Period; Ending Stock Price means the average of the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange of one share of the Company’s common stock for the thirty (30) trading days prior to the end of the Performance Period; Change in Stock Price means the difference between the Beginning Stock Price and the Ending Stock Price; and Dividends Paid means the total of all dividends paid on one (1) share of stock during the Performance Period, provided that dividends shall be treated as though they are reinvested at the end of each calendar quarter. 

Following the Total Shareholder Return determination, the Company’s Percentile Rank shall be determined as follows:   
  
Percentile  
Rank 

=  Company Rank   
Total number of companies in Peer Group  
including the Company   
  
Company Rank shall be determined by listing from highest Total Shareholder Return to lowest Total Shareholder Return each company in the Peer Group (including the Company) and counting up from the company with the lowest Total Shareholder Return. 

The percent of Target Number of Performance Shares earned shall then be determined based on the following chart:

Interpolation shall be used to determine the percent of Target Number of Performance Shares Earned in the event the Company’s Percentile Rank does not fall directly on one of the ranks listed in the above chart. 

4\. Termination of Employment or Service. Except as provided below, a Participant is eligible for payment of earned Performance Shares, as specified in Section 3, only if the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or its affiliates continues through the end of the Performance Period. 

Retirement, Disability or Death: If a Participant retires, suffers a Disability, or dies during the Performance Period, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that the Participant shall be eligible for that proportion of the number of Performance Shares earned under Section 3 for such Performance Period that his or her number of full months of participation during the Performance Period bears to the total number of months in the Performance Period. In the event of the death of the Participant, the Participant’s designated beneficiary or estate shall be entitled to the Performance Shares under the same conditions as would have been applicable to the Participant. For this purpose, “retirement” shall be defined as “Retirement” under the Washington Gas Light Company Employees’ Pension Plan. 

“Disability” for purposes of this Award means “Disability” as determined under the Washington Gas Light Company Employees’ Pension Plan. 

Other Causes of Termination: Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, termination of employment or service for any reason other than Retirement, Disability, or death during the Performance Period results in forfeiture of this entire Award, with no payment to the Participant. 

5\. Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control, as defined in the Plan, and subject to the limitations of Section 7(f) of the Plan, the Target Number of Performance Shares shall automatically vest as of the effective date of the Change of Control, and shall be settled in Stock within as soon as practicable following the effective date of the Change of Control.

10\. Tax Withholding. The Company may deduct or withhold, or require the Participant or beneficiary to remit to the Company or its affiliates, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Agreement. 

11\. Share Withholding. Participants may elect to satisfy the tax withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company or its affiliates withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to taxes required to be withheld on the transaction. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 

12\. Limitations on Transferability. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan or by the Committee, the Participant’s rights under this Agreement and the right to Performance Shares under this Agreement may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
