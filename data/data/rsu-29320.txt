2009 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 



THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of May 2, 2013 (the “Date of Grant”), is made by and between National Bank Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“NBHC”), and [ ] (“Participant”). 

WHEREAS, NBHC has adopted the National Bank Holdings Corporation 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”); and 

WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) has determined that it would be in the best interests of NBHC and its shareholders to grant Participant a number of shares of NBHC’s Common Stock (the “Shares”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. 

NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows: 

1.Grant of Restricted Stock Award. 

a.Grant. NBHC hereby grants to Participant an award of Restricted Stock with respect to an aggregate of [ ] restricted Shares (the “Restricted Stock”), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and as otherwise provided in the Plan.

b.Incorporation by Reference, Etc. The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the Plan. 

2.Vesting. 

a.Time Vesting Restricted Stock. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, based on Participant’s continued employment with NBHC through the applicable dates specified below (the “Service Condition”) (i) one quarter (rounded down to the nearest whole share if applicable) of the Shares of Restricted Stock shall vest on the second anniversary of the Date of Grant, (ii) one quarter (rounded down to the nearest whole share if applicable) of the Shares of Restricted Stock shall vest on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, (iii) one quarter (rounded down to the nearest whole share if applicable) of the Shares of Restricted Stock shall vest on the fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant and (iv) the remaining Shares of Restricted Stock shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant.

3.Tax Withholding. NBHC shall reasonably determine the amount of any federal, state, local or other income, employment or other taxes that NBHC or any of its subsidiaries may reasonably be obligated to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or other event with respect to the Restricted Stock. NBHC’s obligation to deliver the Restricted Stock or any certificates evidencing the Restricted Stock (or to make a book entry or other electronic notation indicating ownership of the Shares), or otherwise remove the restrictive notations or legends on such shares or certificates that refer to nontransferability as set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement, is subject to the condition precedent that Participant either pay or provide for the amount of any such withholding obligations in such manner as may be authorized by the Committee or as may otherwise be permitted under Section 13(d) of the Plan. With respect to tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of Restricted Stock, Participant shall satisfy such obligation by surrendering to NBHC a portion of the Shares that are issued or transferred to Participant upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock (but only to the extent of the minimum withholding required by law), and the Shares so surrendered by Participant shall be credited against any such withholding obligation at the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date of such surrender (and the amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares shall be remitted to the appropriate tax authorities). 

PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS PARTICIPANT’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT NBHC’S, TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) OF THE CODE, EVEN IF PARTICIPANT REQUESTS NBHC OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE TO ASSIST PARTICIPANT IN MAKING THIS FILING. 

Participant shall promptly notify NBHC of any election made pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. 

Participant acknowledges that the tax laws and regulations applicable to the Restricted Stock and the disposition of the Restricted Stock following vesting are complex and subject to change, and it is the sole responsibility of Participant to obtain Participant’s own advice as to the tax treatment of the terms of this Agreement. 

4.Issuance of Restricted Stock. The Restricted Stock shall be issued by NBHC and shall be registered in Participant’s name on the stock transfer books of NBHC promptly after the date hereof. Any certificates representing Restricted Stock shall remain in the physical custody of NBHC or its designee at all times prior to, in the case of any particular Share of the Restricted Stock, the date on which such Share vests. Any certificates representing Restricted Stock shall have affixed thereto a legend in substantially the following form, in addition to any other legends that may be required under federal or state securities laws: 

Transfer of this certificate and the shares represented hereby is restricted pursuant to the terms of the National Bank Holdings Corporation 2009 Equity Incentive Plan and a Restricted Stock Award Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2013, between National Bank Holdings Corporation and [participant’s name]. A copy of such Agreement is on file at the offices of National Bank Holdings Corporation.

As soon as practicable following the vesting of any Restricted Stock, NBHC shall ensure that its stock transfer books reflect the vesting. If certificates for the Restricted Stock exist, such certificates for such vested Restricted Stock shall be delivered to Participant or to Participant’s legal representative along with the stock powers relating thereto. 

5.Dividend and Voting Rights. After the Date of Grant, Participant shall be the record owner of the Restricted Stock unless and until such Shares are forfeited pursuant to Participant’s Termination of Service or sold or otherwise disposed of, and as record owner shall be entitled to all rights of a common shareholder of NBHC, including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to payment of cash or in-kind dividends, if any, with respect to the Restricted Stock; provided that the Restricted Stock shall be subject to the limitations on transfer and encumbrance set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. 

6.Transferability. The Restricted Stock may not, at any time prior to becoming vested, be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against NBHC, its Subsidiary or Affiliate; provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance. The Restricted Stock shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement. 

7.Adjustment. In the event of any event described in Section 13 of the Plan occurring after the Date of Grant, the adjustment provisions as provided for under Section 13 of the Plan shall apply to the Restricted Stock. 

8.Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control of NBHC occurring after the Date of Grant, the provisions set forth in Section 14 of the Plan shall apply to the Restricted Stock. 

9.Forfeiture. Participant agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of any agreement to which he or she is subject with NBHC or NBH Bank, N.A., (collectively, the “Company”), and in addition to and not in contravention of any clawback provision applicable to Participant: 

(i)If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company as a result of Participant’s misconduct in connection with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, the Committee may require Participant to forfeit unvested Restricted Stock, and/or to reimburse the Company for all amounts received under this Agreement from the Company during the 12 month period following the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurs) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement; and any amounts received with respect to, or profits realized from the vesting of Restricted Stock or the sale of securities of the Company during that 12 month period; 

(ii)If the Committee shall determine that Participant has engaged in a serious breach of conduct, the Committee may require Participant to forfeit unvested Restricted Stock, may terminate this Agreement and/or require Participant to repay any amounts realized upon the vesting of Restricted Stock or on the subsequent sale of the shares of common stock that were granted as Restricted Stock or the cancellation of shares relating to Restricted Stock; and

(iii)If Participant is found guilty of misconduct by any judicial or administrative authority in connection with any (A) formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission or (B) other federal or state regulatory investigation, the Committee may require Participant to forfeit unvested Restricted Stock and/or may require the repayment of any amounts realized upon the vesting of Restricted Stock or on the subsequent sale of the shares of common stock that were granted as Restricted Stock or the cancellation of shares relating to Restricted Stock without regard to the timing of the determination of misconduct in relation to the timing of the vesting or sale of the award.

The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend any terms of, this Agreement and the Restricted Stock granted thereunder; provided that any such waiver or amendment that would impair the rights of any Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Restricted Stock theretofore granted shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of Participant. No waiver of any right hereunder by any party shall operate as a waiver of any other right, or as a waiver of the same right with respect to any subsequent occasion for its exercise, or as a waiver of any right to damages.
