(c) The Company shall have the right to offset against any damages resulting from a breach by Maloney of Section 5.3 or Section 6 of this Agreement. 

5.3 Restrictive Covenants. Upon termination of Maloney’s employment hereunder for any reason, Maloney agrees that for the one-year period following the termination of employment, Maloney will not: 

(a) directly or indirectly, within a ten-mile radius of Maloney’s office at the Company, whether for his own account or as an individual, employee, director, consultant or advisor, or in any other capacity whatsoever, provide services that are substantially similar to the services he provided to the Company to any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise that competes with the Business of the Company, unless he obtains the prior written consent of the Board; 

(b) directly or indirectly encourage or solicit, or attempt to encourage or solicit, on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise that competes with the Business of the Company, any individual to leave the Company’s employ for any reason or interfere in any other manner with the employment relationships at the time existing between the Company and its current or prospective employees. 

(c) induce or attempt to induce, on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or other business enterprise that competes with the Business of the Company, any provider, payor, customer, supplier, distributor, licensee or other business relation of the Company with whom Maloney dealt at any time during the two-year period preceding his termination of employment to cease doing business with the Company or in any way interfere with the existing business relationship between any such customer, supplier, distributor, licensee or other business relation described above and the Company. 

Maloney acknowledges that monetary damages will not be sufficient to compensate the Company for any economic loss that may be incurred by reason of breach of the foregoing restrictive covenants. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, the Company shall, in addition to any remedies available to the Company at law, be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of an injunction precluding Maloney from continuing to engage in such breach. 

In the event that any of the foregoing restrictive covenants are too broad to be enforceable, the parties request and agree that they may be reduced to such lesser breadth as may be necessary to make them enforceable. The covenants in this section 5.3 shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other agreement between the parties. Maloney agrees that the existence of any claim or cause of action of Maloney against the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of these covenants.
