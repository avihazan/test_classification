Except as expressly provided in this Article 3, the parties agree that, during the term of this Agreement and for [*****] thereafter, the receiving party (a) will not publish or otherwise disclose to any third party, and (b) will not use for any purpose except for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement any Confidential Information furnished to it by the other party pursuant to this Agreement. Each party will take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party, as a receiving party, will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. The obligations under this Article 3 will not apply to any information to the extent that it can be established by the receiving party by competent proof that such information:

(i) was already known to the receiving party, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party under this Article 3;

Juno acknowledges that it has no right to receive, and MabVax shall not provide the Domains, or the genetic sequences of any antibody or antibody fragment therein, or any binding domain therein, under this Agreement. In any event, however, the Domains constitute MabVax Confidential Information (subject to the provisions of Section 3.1).

3.2 Permitted Use and Disclosures. Each party may use or disclose Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party to the extent such use or disclosure is reasonably necessary in complying with any applicable law, order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental body or governmental agency or otherwise submitting information to tax or other governmental authorities, provided that such party will provide the other party with prompt written notice of such planned disclosure prior to such disclosure (only to the extent prior notice is allowed under applicable laws, orders, rules or regulations) so that the other party may seek a protective order or other

A reference to any legislation or to any provision of any legislation will include any modification, amendment, re-enactment thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefore and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued or related to such legislation. The parties and their respective counsel have had an opportunity to fully negotiate this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

7.7 Waiver. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of a party’s rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed as a waiver of such party’s rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party’s right to take subsequent action. No exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such party is entitled by law to enforce.
