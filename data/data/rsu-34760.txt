2.Acceptance of Restricted Stock Award. The Grantee accepts the Restricted Stock Award confirmed by this Agreement, acknowledges having received a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan, as the Plan may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that no alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the Plan shall, without the written consent of the Grantee, adversely affect the rights of the Grantee with respect to the Restricted Stock.

3.Restrictions

A. If the Grantee experiences a Separation From Service for any reason prior to one of the dates listed below other than because of the Grantee’s death or disability, the number of shares of Restricted Stock set forth next to such date and any subsequent date listed below will, upon such Separation From Service and without any further action, be forfeited to the Company by the Grantee and cease to be issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company:

B. No Grantee shall sell, exchange, assign, alienate, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, charge, give, transfer or otherwise dispose of, either voluntarily or by operation of law, any shares of the Restricted Stock, or any rights or interests appertaining to the Restricted Stock, prior to the lapse of the employment restriction imposed by Section 3(A).

C. As of the Date of Award, certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock will be issued in the name of the Grantee and held by the Company in escrow until the earlier of the forfeiture of the shares of the Restricted Stock to the Company or the lapse of the employment restriction set forth in Section 3(A) above with respect to such shares.

D. The Grantee understands the provisions of Article 13.9 of the Plan to the effect that the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock under the Plan is subject to (i) the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for the Company, (ii) the condition that the shares shall have been listed (or authorized for listing upon official notice of issuance) upon each stock exchange, if any, on which the Common Stock may then be listed, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for the Company and (iii) any other applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders which may then be in effect.

The certificate or certificates representing the shares to be issued or delivered hereunder may bear any legends required by any applicable securities laws and may reflect any transfer or other restrictions imposed by the Plan, and the Company may at some time issue to the stock transfer agent appropriate stop-transfer instructions with respect to such shares. In addition, also as a condition precedent to the issuance or delivery of shares, the Grantee may be required to make certain other representations and warranties and to provide certain other information to enable the Company to comply with the laws, rules, regulations and orders specified under the first sentence of this Section 3(D) and to execute a joinder to any shareholders’ agreement of the Company, in the form provided by the Company, pursuant to which the transfer of shares received under the Plan may be restricted.

4.Withholding of Taxes. The Grantee will be advised by the Company as to the amount of any Federal income or employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company on the compensation income resulting from the award of or lapse of restrictions on the Restricted Stock. The timing of the withholding will depend on whether the Grantee makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code. State, local or foreign income or employment taxes may also be required to be withheld by the Company on any compensation income resulting from the award of the Restricted Stock. The Grantee will pay any taxes required to be withheld directly to the Company upon request.

If the Grantee does not pay any taxes required to be withheld directly to the Company within ten days after any request as provided above, the Company may withhold such taxes from any other compensation to which the Grantee is entitled from the Company. The Grantee will hold the Company harmless in acting to satisfy the withholding obligation in this manner if it becomes necessary to do so.

5.Interpretation of Plan and Agreement. This Agreement is the agreement referred to in Article 7.4 of the Plan. If there is any conflict between the Plan and this Agreement, the provisions of the Plan will control. Any dispute or disagreement which arises under or in any way relates to the interpretation or construction of the Plan or this Agreement will be resolved by the Administrator and the decision of the Administrator will be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes.

7.Binding Effect. This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company and upon the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of the Grantee.
