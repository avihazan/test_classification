1. Grant of Option. Pursuant to the Snap Interactive, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for Employees, Contractors, and Outside Directors of Snap Interactive, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), the Company grants to

* * *

(the “Participant”),

who is an Employee of the Company, an option (the “Option” or “Stock Option”) to purchase a total of _____________________ (_________) full shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Optioned Shares”) at an “Option Price” equal to $________ per share (being the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock on this Date of Grant or 110% of such Fair Market Value, in the case of a ten percent (10%) or more stockholder as provided in Section 422 of the Code), in the amounts, during the periods and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Incentive Stock Option Agreement (the “Agreement”).

The “Date of Grant” of this Stock Option is _________________, 20___. The “Option Period” shall commence on the Date of Grant and shall expire on the date immediately preceding the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant (or the date immediately preceding the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Date of Grant, in the case of a ten percent (10%) or more stockholder as provided in Section 422 of the Code) unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 4 below. The Stock Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option.

2. Subject to Plan. The Stock Option and its exercise are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the terms of the Plan shall control to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Plan shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Plan. The Stock Option is subject to any rules promulgated pursuant to the Plan by the Board or the Committee and communicated to the Participant in writing.

3. Vesting; Time of Exercise. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement and subject to certain restrictions and conditions set forth in the Plan, the Optioned Shares shall be vested and the Stock Option shall be exercisable as follows:

a. _____________________ of the total Optioned Shares shall vest and that portion of the Stock Option shall become exercisable on _________________________, provided the Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on that date.

b. An additional ____________________ of the total Optioned Shares shall vest and that portion of the Stock Option shall become exercisable on ________________________, provided the Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on that date.

c. The remaining ______________________ of the total Optioned Shares shall vest and that portion of the Stock Option shall become exercisable on _______________________, provided the Participant is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on that date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change in Control, (i) fifty percent (50%) of the then-unvested Optioned Shares immediately shall vest on the date of the Change in Control; and (ii) the remaining fifty percent (50%) of then unvested Optioned Shares shall vest on the earlier of (A) the original date such Optioned Shares would have vested under Sections 3.a.-c. above, or (B) equally on the first and second anniversary of the effective date of the Change in Control.

4. Term; Forfeiture.

a. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, to the extent the unexercised portion of the Stock Option relates to Optioned Shares which are not vested on the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service, the Stock Option will be terminated on that date. The unexercised portion of the Stock Option that relates to Optioned Shares which are vested will terminate at the first of the following to occur:

i. 5 p.m. on the date the Option Period terminates;

ii. 5 p.m. on the date which is twelve (12) months following the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to death, Retirement or Total and Permanent Disability;

iii. immediately upon the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company for Cause (as defined herein);

iv. 5 p.m. on the date which is three (3) months following the date of the Participant’s Termination of Service for any reason not otherwise specified in this Section 4.a.;  


v. 5 p.m. on the date the Company causes any portion of the Stock Option to be forfeited pursuant to Section 7 hereof; or

vi. immediately upon the Participant’s violation of any non-compete or non-solicitation agreement entered into between the Company and the Participant.

b. For purposes hereof, “Cause” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any employment agreement in effect by and between the Company and the Participant; provided, however, at any time there is no such employment agreement in effect, or if such employment agreement does not define such term, the term “Cause” shall mean (i) acts of fraud or dishonesty in the course of employment, (ii) violations of law causing material harm to the Company, (iii) substance abuse causing harm to the Company or impairing performance, (iv) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, or (v) insubordination, dereliction of duties, habitual absenteeism, or material failure to follow reasonable Company instructions after (solely in the case of this clause (v)) notice to the Participant and the Participant’s failure to correct same within the time period specified in the notice, which time period shall be not less than ten (10) business days.

5. Who May Exercise. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 3 and 4 above, during the lifetime of the Participant, the Stock Option may be exercised only by the Participant, or by the Participant’s guardian or personal or legal representative. If the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to his death prior to the dates specified in Section 4.a. hereof, and the Participant has not exercised the Stock Option as to the maximum number of vested Optioned Shares as set forth in Section 3 hereof as of the date of death, the following persons may exercise the exercisable portion of the Stock Option on behalf of the Participant at any time prior to the earliest of the dates specified in Section 4.a. hereof: the personal representative of his estate, or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Stock Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Participant; provided that the Stock Option shall remain subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the Plan, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

6. No Fractional Shares. The Stock Option may be exercised only with respect to full shares, and no fractional share of stock shall be issued.

7. Manner of Exercise. Subject to such administrative regulations as the Committee may from time to time adopt, the Stock Option may be exercised by the delivery of written notice to the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Option is to be exercised, the date of exercise thereof (the “Exercise Date”) which shall be at least three (3) days after giving such notice unless an earlier time shall have been mutually agreed upon, and whether the Optioned Shares to be exercised will be considered as deemed granted under an Incentive Stock Option as provided in Section 11. On the Exercise Date, the Participant shall deliver to the Company consideration with a value equal to the total Option Price of the shares to be purchased, payable as follows: (a) cash, check, bank draft, or money order payable to the order of the Company, (b) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, Common Stock (including Restricted Stock) owned by the Participant on the Exercise Date, valued at its Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, and which the Participant has not acquired from the Company within six (6) months prior to the Exercise Date, (c) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, by delivery (including by FAX) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions from the Participant to a broker or dealer, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to sell certain of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or to pledge such shares as collateral for a loan and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay such purchase price, and/or (d) in any other form of valid consideration that is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event that shares of Restricted Stock are tendered as consideration for the exercise of a Stock Option, a number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of the Stock Option equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock used as consideration therefor shall be subject to the same restrictions and provisions as the Restricted Stock so tendered.

Upon payment of all amounts due from the Participant, the Company shall cause certificates for the Common Stock then being purchased to be delivered to the Participant (or the person exercising the Participant’s Stock Option in the event of his death) at its principal business office promptly after the Exercise Date. The obligation of the Company to deliver shares of Common Stock shall, however, be subject to the condition that, if at any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the listing, registration, or qualification of the Stock Option or the Common Stock upon any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with, the Stock Option or the issuance or purchase of shares of Common Stock thereunder, then the Stock Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not reasonably acceptable to the Committee.

If the Participant fails to pay for any of the Optioned Shares specified in such notice or fails to accept delivery thereof, that portion of the Participant’s Stock Option and right to purchase such Optioned Shares may be forfeited by the Participant.

8. Nonassignability. The Stock Option is not assignable or transferable by the Participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

9. Rights as Stockholder. The Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any of the Optioned Shares until the issuance of a certificate or certificates to the Participant for the shares of Common Stock. The Optioned Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the issuance of such certificate or certificates. The Participant, by his or her execution of this Agreement, agrees to execute any documents requested by the Company in connection with the issuance of a certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock.

10. Adjustment of Number of Optioned Shares and Related Matters. The number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Stock Option, and the Option Prices thereof, shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Articles 11 – 13 of the Plan.

11. Incentive Stock Option. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Stock Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option. To the extent the number of Optioned Shares exceeds the limit set forth in Section 6.3 of the Plan, such Optioned Shares shall be deemed granted pursuant to a Nonqualified Stock Option. Unless otherwise indicated by the Participant in the notice of exercise pursuant to Section 7, upon any exercise of this Stock Option, the number of exercised Optioned Shares that shall be deemed to be exercised pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option shall equal the total number of Optioned Shares so exercised multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of unexercised Optioned Shares that could then be exercised pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option, and (ii) the denominator of which is the then total number of unexercised Optioned Shares.

12. Disqualifying Disposition. In the event that Common Stock acquired upon exercise of this Stock Option is disposed of by the Participant in a “Disqualifying Disposition,” such Participant shall notify the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after such disposition of the date and terms of such disposition. For purposes hereof, “Disqualifying Disposition” shall mean a disposition of Common Stock that is acquired upon the exercise of this Stock Option (and that is not deemed granted pursuant to a Nonqualified Stock Option under Section 11) prior to the expiration of either two (2) years from the Date of Grant of this Stock Option or one (1) year from the transfer of shares to the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option.

13. Voting. The Participant, as record holder of some or all of the Optioned Shares following exercise of this Stock Option, has the exclusive right to vote, or consent with respect to, such Optioned Shares until such time as the Optioned Shares are transferred in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that this Section shall not create any voting right where the holders of such Optioned Shares otherwise have no such right.

14. Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that remedies at law will be inadequate remedies for breach of this Agreement and consequently agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable by specific performance. The remedy of specific performance shall be cumulative of all of the rights and remedies at law or in equity of the parties under this Agreement.

15. Participant’s Representations. Notwithstanding any of the provisions hereof, the Participant hereby agrees that he will not exercise the Stock Option granted hereby, and that the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to the Participant hereunder, if the exercise thereof or the issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the Participant or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority. Any determination in this connection by the Company shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The obligations of the Company and the rights of the Participant are subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

16. Participant’s Acknowledgments. The Participant acknowledges that a copy of the Plan has been made available for his or her review by the Company, and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts this Stock Option subject to all the terms and provisions thereof. The Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive, and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee or the Board, as appropriate, upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Agreement.

This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding any conflict of laws rule or principle of Delaware law that might refer the governance, construction, or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state).

18. No Right to Continue Employment. Nothing herein shall be construed to confer upon the Participant the right to continue in the employment of the Company or interfere with or restrict in any way the right of the Company to discharge the Participant at any time (subject to any contract rights of the Participant).

19. Legal Construction. In the event that any one or more of the terms, provisions, or agreements that are contained in this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term, provision, or agreement shall not affect any other term, provision, or agreement that is contained in this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term, provision, or agreement had never been contained herein.

20. Covenants and Agreements as Independent Agreements. Each of the covenants and agreements that is set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as a covenant and agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action of the Participant against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the covenants and agreements that are set forth in this Agreement.

21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement together with the Plan supersede any and all other prior understandings and agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitute the sole and only agreements between the parties with respect to the said subject matter. All prior negotiations and agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof are merged into this Agreement.
