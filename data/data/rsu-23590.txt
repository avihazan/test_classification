MAKO SURGICAL CORP.  
2008 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN  
INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT  
  
Incentive Stock Option

This option is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and will be interpreted accordingly. If you cease to be an employee of the Company, its parent or a subsidiary (“Employee”) but continue to provide Service, this option will be deemed a nonstatutory stock option three months after you cease to be an Employee. In addition, to the extent that all or part of this option exceeds the $100,000 rule of section 422(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, this option or the lesser excess part will be deemed to be a nonstatutory stock option.  
  
Vesting

This option is only exercisable before it expires and then only with respect to the vested portion of the option. Subject to the preceding sentence, you may exercise this option, in whole or in part, to purchase a whole number of vested shares by following the procedures set forth in the Plan and below in this Agreement.  
  
No additional shares of Stock will vest after your Service has terminated for any reason.  
  
Term

Your option will expire in any event at the close of business at Company headquarters on the day before the 10th anniversary of the Grant Date, as shown on the cover sheet. Your option will expire earlier if your Service terminates, as described below. [Note: if Grantee is a 10% stockholder, the term can’t be longer than 5 years.]  
  
Regular Termination

If your Service terminates for any reason, other than death, Disability or Cause, then your option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the 90th day after your termination date.  
  
Termination for   
Cause

If your Service is terminated for Cause, then you shall immediately forfeit all rights to your option and the option shall immediately expire.  
  
Death

If your Service terminates because of your death, then your option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date twelve (12) months after the date of death. During that twelve month period, your estate or heirs may exercise the vested portion of your option.

#####   
  
In addition, if you die during the 90-day period described in connection with a regular termination (i.e., a termination of your Service not on account of your death, Disability or Cause), and a vested portion of your option has not yet been exercised, then your option will instead expire on the date twelve (12) months after your termination date. In such a case, during the period following your death up to the date twelve (12) months after your termination date, your estate or heirs may exercise the vested portion of your option.  
  
Disability

If your Service terminates because of your Disability, then your option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date twelve (12) months after your termination date.  
  
Leaves of Absence

For purposes of this option, your Service does not terminate when you go on a bona fide employee leave of absence that was approved by the Company in writing, if the terms of the leave provide for continued Service crediting, or when continued Service crediting is required by applicable law. However, your Service will be treated as terminating 90 days after you went on employee leave, unless your right to return to active work is guaranteed by law or by a contract. Your Service terminates in any event when the approved leave ends unless you immediately return to active employee work.  
  
The Company determines, in its sole discretion, which leaves count for this purpose, and when your Service terminates for all purposes under the Plan.  
  
Notice of Exercise

When you wish to exercise this option, you must notify the Company by filing the proper “Notice of Exercise” form at the address given on the form. Your notice must specify how many shares you wish to purchase. Your notice must also specify how your shares of Stock should be registered (in your name only or in your and your spouse’s names as joint tenants with right of survivorship). The notice will be effective when it is received by the Company.  
  
If someone else wants to exercise this option after your death, that person must prove to the Company’s satisfaction that he or she is entitled to do so.  
  
Form of Payment

When you submit your notice of exercise, you must include payment of the option price for the shares you are purchasing. Payment may be made in one (or a combination) of the following forms:  
  
• Cash, your personal check, a cashier’s check, a money order or another cash equivalent acceptable to the Company.

##### 

• Shares of Stock withheld by the Company from the shares of Stock otherwise to be received, with such withheld shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate option price.  
• Shares of Stock which have already been owned by you and which are surrendered to the Company. The Fair Market Value of the shares, determined as of the effective date of the option exercise, will be applied to the option price.  
• By delivery (on a form prescribed by the Company) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell Stock and to deliver all or part of the sale proceeds to the Company in payment of the aggregate option price and any withholding taxes.  
  
Withholding Taxes

You will not be allowed to exercise this option unless you make acceptable arrangements to pay any withholding or other taxes that may be due as a result of the option exercise or sale of Stock acquired under this option. In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, local or foreign tax or withholding payment is required relating to the exercise or sale of shares arising from this grant, the Company shall have the right to require such payments from you, or withhold such amounts from other payments due to you from the Company or any Affiliate.  
  
Transfer of Option

During your lifetime, only you (or, in the event of your legal incapacity or incompetency, your guardian or legal representative) may exercise the option. You cannot transfer or assign this option. For instance, you may not sell this option or use it as security for a loan. If you attempt to do any of these things, this option will immediately become invalid. You may, however, dispose of this option in your will or it may be transferred upon your death by the laws of descent and distribution.  
  
Regardless of any marital property settlement agreement, the Company is not obligated to honor a notice of exercise from your spouse, nor is the Company obligated to recognize your spouse’s interest in your option in any other way.  
  
Retention Rights

Neither your option nor this Agreement give you the right to be retained by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates) in any capacity. The Company (and any Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates) reserve the right to terminate your Service at any time and for any reason.

Shareholder Rights

You, or your estate or heirs, have no rights as a shareholder of the Company until a certificate for your option’s shares has been issued (or an appropriate book entry has been made). No adjustments are made for dividends or other rights if the applicable record date occurs before your stock certificate is issued (or an appropriate book entry has been made), except as described in the Plan.

Unless otherwise specified in an employment or other agreement between the Company and you, you take actions in competition with the Company if you directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or are a proprietor, director, officer, stockholder, member, partner or an employee or agent of, or a consultant to any business, firm, corporation, partnership or other entity which competes with any business in which the Company or any of its Affiliates is engaged during your employment or other relationship with the Company or its Affiliates or at the time of your termination of Service. Under the prior sentence, ownership of less than 1% of the securities of a public company shall not be treated as an action in competition with the Company.  
  
Adjustments

In the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in the Stock, the number of shares covered by this option and the option price per share shall be adjusted (and rounded down to the nearest whole number) if required pursuant to the Plan. Your option shall be subject to the terms of the agreement of merger, liquidation or reorganization in the event the Company is subject to such corporate activity.  
  
Applicable Law

This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of Delaware, other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.  
  
The Plan

The text of the Plan is incorporated in this Agreement by reference. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the Plan, and have the meaning set forth in the Plan. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Company regarding this option.
