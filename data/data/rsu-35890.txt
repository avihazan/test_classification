THIS Award Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated as of __________, by and between BORGWARNER INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and ______________________ (the “Employee”), is entered into as follows:

  


WITNESSETH:

  


WHEREAS, the Company has established the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), a copy of which is attached hereto or which has been previously provided to the Employee;

  


WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Company has determined that the Employee be granted Stock Units pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement;

  


NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth:

  


1\. 

Award of Stock Units. The Company hereby awards to Employee on this date, [####] Stock Units. Each Stock Unit awarded hereunder represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $.01 (“Stock”) upon satisfaction of the conditions for vesting as provided in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement and subject further to the terms of the Plan and the additional terms and conditions of this Agreement (the “Award”).  
  
  


2\. 

Stock Units. The Company shall credit the Employee’s Stock Units to a Stock Units account established and maintained for the Employee on the books of the Company payable only in Stock. The account shall constitute the record of the Stock Units awarded to Employee under this Agreement, is solely for accounting purposes, and shall not require a segregation of any Company assets.  
  
  


3\. 

Dividend Equivalents. Whenever the Company pays any cash or other dividend or makes any other distribution in respect of the Stock, the Employee’s account shall be credited with an additional number of Stock Units (including fractions thereof) determined by multiplying (i) the number of Stock Units credited to the Employee on the dividend record date by (ii) the dividend paid on each share of Stock, and dividing the result of such multiplication by (iii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the dividend payment date. Credits shall be made effective as of the date of the dividend or other distribution in respect of the Stock. Dividend equivalents credited to the Employee’s account shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Stock Units in respect of which the dividends or other distribution were credited, including, without limitation, the Award’s vesting conditions and distribution provisions.  
  
  


4\. 

Vesting of Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the provisions of the Plan , the Stock Units shall vest in accordance with the following schedule:

b. 

In the event of Employee’s voluntary Termination of Employment, the Employee shall forfeit all rights to Stock Units not yet vested as of the date of Employee’s Termination of Employment;  
  
c. 

(i) In the event of a Change in Control, any remaining restrictions applicable to any then unvested Stock Units shall lapse, and such Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested; and  
  
  


d. 

In the event of the Employee’s death, Disability, involuntary termination by the Company without Cause or Retirement prior to the vesting of the Stock Units, the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any or all remaining payment limitations with respect to the Stock Units awarded under this Agreement.  
  
  


5\. 

Distribution of Stock.  The Company shall deliver Stock to the Employee in settlement of the Stock Units awarded by this Agreement equal to the number of the Employee's vested Stock Units (including any additional Stock Units acquired as a result of dividend equivalents that have vested). If Employee is a “Specified Employee” (as defined by regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”)), at the time of his Termination of Employment, payment shall be made on the first day of the seventh month following the month in which such Termination of Employment occurs, or, if earlier, the date of the Employee’s death. If the Employee is not a “Specified Employee” at the time of distribution, payment shall be made to the Employee on or after the Employee’s Termination of Employment, in the year in which such Termination of Employment occurs.

The Stock Units awarded under this Agreement, and any rights and privileges pertaining thereto, are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance by the Employee or by the Employee's beneficiary, in any manner, by operation of law or otherwise, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  
  
  


7\. 

No Rights as a Stockholder. Prior to the actual delivery of Stock to the Employee in settlement of the Stock Units awarded and vested hereunder (if any), the Employee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the Stock Units or any underlying Stock.  
  
  


8\. 

No Right to Continued Employment.

The Award is made pursuant to, and is subject to the Plan, including, without limitation, its provisions governing a Change in Control and Cancellation and Rescission of Awards. In the case of any conflict between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control.
