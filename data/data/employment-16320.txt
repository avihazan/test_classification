The initial Term of Employment (as defined below) under this Agreement, and the employment of the Executive hereunder, shall commence on October 7, 2011 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire on October 31, 2013, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5 hereof (the "Initial Term").

2.2 Renewal Terms. At the end of the Initial Term, the Term of Employment automatically shall renew for successive two year terms from November 1 to October 31 (subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof), unless the Company or the Executive delivers written notice to the other at least three months prior to the Expiration Date of its or his election not to renew the Term of Employment.

The period during which the Executive shall be employed by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Term of Employment," and the date on which the Term of Employment shall expire is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Expiration Date".

3\. Compensation.

3.1 Base Salary. The Executive shall receive a base salary at the monthly rate of $7,500 (the "Base Salary") during the Term of Employment. The Base Salary will accrue (the "Accrued Base Salary") and be paid to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. When the Company is in production and profitable based on its most recent month end unaudited income statement, the Base Salary will stop accruing and be paid on the 1st business day of each month, subject to applicable withholding and other taxes. The Base Salary shall be reviewed, at least annually, for merit increases and may, by action and in the discretion of the Board, be increased at any time or from time to time, but may not be decreased.

3.2 Accrued Base Salary Payment. The Accrued Base Salary shall be paid to the Executive at such time as the Company is in production and profitable as described above, subject to applicable withholding and other taxes. If the Company is not in production and profitable as described above on or before March 31, 2013, or the Term of Employment is terminated for any reason prior to the Expiration Date, the Executive has the option by giving written notice to Varca (the "Notice") to either: (a) take a promissory note from the Company (the "Note") in the principal amount of the Accrued Base Salary as of the date Varca receives the Notice, subject to applicable withholding and other taxes, with interest accruing on the outstanding principal amount of the Note at the rate of 10% per annum; or (b) receive shares of unregistered common stock of Varca (the "Common Stock") equal to the Accrued Base Salary as of the date Varca receives the Notice, subject to applicable withholding and other taxes, divided by the Closing Sales Price. As used herein, "Closing Sales Price" means (i) the reported closing sales price of the Common Stock on the day Varca receives the Notice if the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange, quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or quoted in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated (or any similar organization or agency succeeding its functions of reporting prices); or in the event that the Common Stock is not listed or quoted as set forth in (i) above, then (ii) the last sales price of a share of Common Stock to a non-affiliate prior to the day Varca receives the Notice .

4\. Expense Reimbursement and Other Benefits.

4.1 Reimbursement of Expenses. Upon the submission of proper substantiation by the Executive, and subject to such rules and guidelines as the Company may from time to time adopt with respect to the reimbursement of expenses of executive personnel, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable expenses actually paid or incurred by the Executive during the Term of Employment in the course of and pursuant to the business of the Company. The Executive shall account to the Company in writing for all expenses for which reimbursement is sought and shall supply to the Company copies of all relevant invoices, receipts or other evidence reasonably requested by the Company.
