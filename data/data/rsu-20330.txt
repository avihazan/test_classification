Dear _______________________________ (“Grantee”):

  


In view of your substantial contributions toward the achievement of the business goals and objectives of DNB Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") and DNB First, National Association (the "Bank") and the expectation of your future contributions, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is pleased to award you an option to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation pursuant to the 1995 Stock Option Plan of DNB Financial Corporation (As amended and restated, effective as of April 27, 2004) (the "Plan"). This letter will serve as the stock option agreement between you and the Corporation. The option awarded to you is subject to the following terms.

  


1. NUMBER OF SHARES: You are awarded an option to purchase a total of ______ shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan.

  


2. RESALE RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES: 

  


(a) When issued, your resale or other disposition of these shares will be restricted for two (2) years from the date the Common Stock is issued to you, on the following terms and will bear the following legend:

  


“Sale, assignment, pledge, gift, or any other disposition, alienation or encumbrance of the shares represented by this certificate are restricted and prohibited until ______________, _____ pursuant to the terms of a Stock Option Agreement dated December 22, 2005, between DNB Financial Corporation and the holder of the shares named on this certificate, which may be examined at the principal office of the Company, and such shares may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, given or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered only upon compliance with the terms of that Agreement.”

  


(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section (but subject to subsection (c) of this Section), upon and after issuance of the shares on your exercise of this option, you will be authorized to resell these shares free of the restriction set forth in subsection (a) of this Section solely for the purpose of paying or reimbursing the Corporation for federal, state or local withholding taxes applicable to your exercise of any stock options relating to shares of Common Stock of the Corporation.

(c) Even if you are permitted to resell these shares free of the restriction described in subsection (a) of this Section, resale may nevertheless be restricted for other reasons under applicable securities laws.

For purposes of the Securities Act, an employee will be considered to be an “affiliate” of the Corporation if such employee directly or indirectly controls the Corporation. In addition, under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), if you are a director or one of certain types of “officer” of the Corporation identified in SEC regulations under Section 16(b), you may be liable to the Corporation for profit you are deemed to realize if you make certain types of purchases and certain types of sales of the Common Stock within a period of less than six months of each other.
