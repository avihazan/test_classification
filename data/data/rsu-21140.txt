BACKGROUND

The Optionee is an Eligible Director of the Company whose continued services are considered essential to the Company’s sustained progress. The Company has adopted the Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. 2005 Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for the purpose of encouraging equity ownership in the Company by outside directors of the Company. Pursuant to and in accordance with the Plan, the Company desires to grant to the Optionee an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock as more fully set forth below. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, it is agreed as follows:

1\. Option to Purchase Shares. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee an Option (the “Option”), pursuant to the Plan, to purchase up to ________________ (___________) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Stock”). The Option Price for each share of Stock shall be ____________________Dollars and ______________ Cents ($______), which is acknowledged to be 100% of the Fair Market Value of each share of Stock as of the date hereof. The Option shall be exercisable for the number of shares of Stock and during the specific exercise periods (“Exercise Period(s)”) set forth in the following table:

2\. Manner of Exercise and Terms of Payment. The Option may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, upon delivery to the Company (to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or his designee) of a notice of exercise in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, accompanied by full payment of the Option Price for the shares of Stock with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment shall be (i) by cashier’s check, certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds (each, a “Cash Payment”), which must be received by the Company by the close of business (i.e., 5:00 p.m. EST) on the business day immediately following the date the notice of exercise is delivered, provided, however, that if a Cash Payment is not so received by the Company, Optionee shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have elected to pay the Option Price by means of a Cashless Exercise (as defined below), (ii) by withholding a sufficient number of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Option Price for the shares of stock with respect to which the Option is exercised (a, “Cashless Exercise”), or (iii) if and as permitted by the Board in its sole discretion, by tendering stock of the Company, all as provided in the Plan. Each notice of exercise shall be deemed delivered to the Company on the date and time specified in Section 11(a) below, provided however, that any such notice of exercise which is deemed delivered on a date on which the NYSE AMEX is closed, or at a time after the closing of the NYSE AMEX stock market, shall be deemed delivered on the immediately following business day, which date shall be deemed the date of exercise for all purposes.

  


3\. Termination of Option.

1 The Exercise Period for these options shall commence on the Accelerate Date, if earlier. The “Acceleration Date” is 12:01 a.m. on the date of termination of Optionee’s service on the Board by reason of Optionee’s retirement after reaching the age of 65 years, or by reason of Optionee’s retirement after becoming permanently disabled.

Except as specifically provided in Sections 3(b), 3(c) and 6(b) hereof, the Option granted hereunder shall terminate as of the close of business on the earliest to occur of the date of (i) expiration of the Option Exercise Period, (ii) an event of default or breach by the Optionee of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (iii) termination of the Optionee’s service on the Board for cause.

(b) Death of Optionee.

Such Option may be so exercised by the Optionee’s executors, administrators or heirs only with respect to that number of shares of Stock which the Optionee had an Option to purchase and only to the extent that the Option was exercisable (but had not theretofore been exercised) as of the date of the earlier of the (i) retirement of the Optionee after reaching the age of 65 years or after becoming permanently disabled, or (ii) death of the Optionee. In no event may the Option be exercised at any time after the expiration of the Exercise Period stated in Section 1 hereof.

5\. Delivery of Stock Certificates.

6\. Certain Corporate Events.

(b) Non-survival of Company. In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any merger or combination in which the Company is not a surviving corporation, the outstanding portion, if any, of the Option granted hereunder shall terminate, but the Optionee shall have the right, immediately prior to such event, to exercise the Option, in whole or in part, to the extent that such Option is then otherwise exercisable and has not previously been exercised; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any such event, the Board may modify the Option granted hereunder so as to accelerate, as a consequence of such transaction, the vesting of the Optionee’s right to exercise such Option.

(c) Change in Control. In the event of any contemplated transaction which may constitute a change in control of the Company, the Board may modify the Option granted hereunder so as to accelerate, as a consequence of such transaction, the vesting of the Optionee’s right to exercise such Option. For this purpose, “change in control of the Company” means a change in control of such nature that it would be required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A or any successor provision (whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirements).

7\. Agreement Subject to Plan. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted in a manner contrary to the purposes and provisions of the Plan, a copy of which may be obtained from the Secretary of the Company. Any question of interpretation arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be resolved by the Board.

8\. Withholding. Optionee may elect to have the Company withhold from those shares of Stock that would otherwise be received upon exercise of the Option, a number of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory amount necessary to satisfy the Company’s applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment tax withholding obligations (collectively, “Withholding Obligations”). In the event Optionee does not notify the Company of his election to withhold shares of Stock and does not remit to the Company, in cash, on or before the applicable taxable event, the full amount necessary to satisfy the Withholding Obligations, the Company shall withhold from those shares of Stock that would otherwise be issued upon exercise of the Option, a number of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Withholding Obligation.

9\. Investment Representation.

(a) The Optionee acknowledges that the Option has not been, and the Stock may not upon issuance be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). The Optionee represents and warrants to the Company that the Optionee is acquiring this Option and the Stock upon exercise of the Option for the Optionee’s own account for the purpose of investment and not with a view toward resale or other distribution thereof in violation of the Act. The Optionee acknowledges that the effect of these representations and warranties is that the economic risk of the investment in the Option and Stock may be borne by the Optionee for an indefinite period of time. This representation and warranty shall be deemed to be a continuing representation and warranty and shall be in full force and effect upon such exercise of the Option granted hereby.

(b) The Company may place a legend on each certificate for the Stock issued pursuant hereto, or any certificate issued in exchange therefor, stating, if such be the case, that such securities are not registered under the Act and setting forth or referring to the restriction on transferability and sale thereof imposed by the Act or any applicable state securities law.
