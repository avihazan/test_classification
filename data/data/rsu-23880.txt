Exhibit 10.1

CPI INTERNATIONAL, INC.  

(Senior Executives)

THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the date of grant set forth on Exhibit A hereto by and between CPI International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the individual (the “Grantee”) set forth on Exhibit A.

A. The Grantee is an employee or consultant of the Company or a Subsidiary, and the Company has determined that it is appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of the Company to issue the Restricted Shares (as defined below) to the Grantee.

B. Accordingly, pursuant to the CPI International, Inc. 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the Company is hereby issuing to the Grantee the number of restricted shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the “Restricted Shares”) as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, and in all respects subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference.

C. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the Grantee and the Company hereby agree as follows:

1\. Restricted Shares.

## 

## 1.1 Issuance of Restricted Shares. In consideration of the Grantee’s service as an employee or consultant of the Company or a Subsidiary, the Company is hereby issuing to the Grantee the Restricted Shares. The Restricted Shares shall be represented by a certificate or certificates issued in the name of the Grantee and endorsed with an appropriate legend referring to the restrictions hereinafter set forth.

## 

## 1.2 Restrictions on Transfer of Shares. The Restricted Shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, pledged, exchanged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of (each, a “Transfer”) by the Grantee, except to the Company, until they have become vested as provided in Section 1.3. Any purported Transfer in violation of the provisions of this Section 1.2 shall be void AB INITIO, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in the Restricted Shares. In addition, the Grantee may not Transfer Restricted Shares that have become vested unless such Restricted Shares are registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or unless the Company and its counsel agree with the Grantee that such Transfer is not required to be registered under the Securities Act.

## 

## 1.3 Vesting; Forfeiture of Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the other provisions of this Agreement, the Restricted Shares shall vest in accordance with the schedule set forth on Exhibit A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in the event of termination of the Grantee’s employment by the Company (or a Subsidiary, as applicable)

## 

* * *

  


## 

## for Cause or the termination of the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant by the Grantee for any reason other than death, Disability or Good Reason (as defined in the Grantee’s employment agreement), the Restricted Shares shall immediately cease vesting as of the date of termination, and (b) in the event of termination of the Grantee’s Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant by the Company (or a Subsidiary, as applicable) without Cause, as a result of death or Disability, or by the Grantee for Good Reason, the Restricted Shares shall become fully vested as of the date of termination. Any Restricted Shares that are not vested on the date of termination shall be forfeited by the Grantee, and the certificate(s) representing the non-vested portion of the Restricted Shares so forfeited shall be canceled.

## 

##  In addition, if, in connection with a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction in which the Company is not the surviving entity, either (i) all obligations under this Agreement are not fully assumed by the surviving or resulting entity, or (ii) the Company fails to provide the Grantee with cash or property with a fair market value equal to the Fair Market Value of the non-vested portion of the Restricted Shares, then the Restricted Shares shall become fully vested prior to the effectiveness of such transaction.

## 

## 1.4 Tax Withholding Obligations. If the Company shall be required to withhold any federal, state, local or foreign tax in connection with any issuance or vesting of Restricted Shares or other securities pursuant to this Agreement, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, then the Grantee shall pay the tax or make provisions that are satisfactory to the Company for the payment thereof. Provided the approval of the Committee is obtained, the Grantee may elect to satisfy all or any part of any such withholding obligation by surrendering to the Company a portion of the Restricted Shares that become vested hereunder, and the Restricted Shares so surrendered by the Grantee shall be credited against any such withholding obligation based on the then Fair Market Value per share of such Restricted Shares on the date of such surrender.

2\. Dividend, Voting and Other Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from and after the Date of Grant, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and receive any dividends that may be paid thereto, provided, however, that any additional Common Stock or other securities that the Grantee may become entitled to receive pursuant to a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, separation or reorganization or any other change in the capital structure of the Company shall be subject to the same risk of forfeiture and restrictions on transfer as the forfeitable Restricted Shares in respect of which they are issued or transferred and shall become Restricted Shares for the purposes of this Agreement.

3\. Retention of Stock Certificate(s) by the Company. The certificate(s) representing the Restricted Shares shall be held in custody by the Company, together with a stock power that shall be endorsed in blank by the Grantee and delivered to the Company within ten (10) days of the date hereof, until such shares have become vested in accordance with Section 1.3.

## 

## 4.9 Severability. The validity, legality or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected even if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

## 

## 4.10 Equitable Relief. The Grantee acknowledges that, in the event of a threatened or actual breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, damages alone will be an inadequate remedy, and such breach will cause the Company great, immediate and irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, the Grantee agrees that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, and that such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any remedies it may have at law or under this Agreement.

## 

4.11 Arbitration.

## 

### 4.11.1 General. Any controversy, dispute, or claim between the parties to this Agreement, including any claim arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, before a single arbitrator, in accordance with this Section 4.11 and the then most applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for determining any such dispute, regardless of its nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may in an appropriate matter apply to a court for provisional relief, including a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, on the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled in arbitration may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. Unless mutually agreed by the parties otherwise, any arbitration shall take place in the City of Palo Alto, California.

### 

### 4.11.2 Selection of Arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from a list of nine arbitrators (which shall be retired judges or corporate or litigation attorneys experienced in executive compensation and stock options) provided by the office of the American Arbitration Association having jurisdiction over Palo Alto, California. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the list so drawn, then the parties shall each strike names alternately from the list, with the first to strike being determined by lot. After each party has used four (4) strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator. If such person is unable to serve for any reason, then the parties shall repeat this process until an arbitrator is selected.

### 

### 4.11.3 Applicability of Arbitration; Remedial Authority. This agreement to resolve any disputes by binding arbitration shall extend to claims against any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity, any officer, director, shareholder, employee or agent of each party, or of any of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising out of state and federal statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the common law. In the event of a dispute subject to this paragraph the parties shall be entitled to reasonable discovery subject to the discretion of the arbitrator. The remedial authority of the arbitrator (which shall include the right to grant injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be the same as, but no greater than, would be the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the parties and their dispute. The 

###

### arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim without an evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that he or it would be entitled to summary judgment if the matter had been pursued in court litigation. In the event of a conflict between the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association and these procedures, the provisions of these procedures shall govern.

### 

### 4.11.4 Fees and Costs. Any filing or administrative fees shall be borne initially by the party requesting arbitration. The Company shall be responsible for the costs and fees of the arbitration, unless the Grantee wishes to contribute (up to 50%) of the costs and fees of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prevailing party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing party’s costs (including but not limited to the arbitrator’s compensation), expenses, and attorneys’ fees.

### 

### 4.11.5 Award Final and Binding. The arbitrator shall render an award and written opinion, and the award shall be final and binding upon the parties. If any of the provisions of this paragraph, or of this Agreement, are determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry out its provisions to the greatest extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all conflicts between the parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration decision and award to be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action, given great weight by any finder of fact, and treated as determinative to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 

## 4.12 Headings. The section headings in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of any particular section.

## 

## 4.13 Number and Gender. Throughout this Agreement, as the context may require, (a) the masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter gender includes the masculine and the feminine; (b) the singular tense and number includes the plural, and the plural tense and number includes the singular; (c) the past tense includes the present, and the present tense includes the past; (d) references to parties, sections, paragraphs and exhibits mean the parties, sections, paragraphs and exhibits of and to this Agreement; and (e) periods of days, weeks or months mean calendar days, weeks or months.

## 

## 4.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
