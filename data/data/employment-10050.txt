WHEREAS, the Executive serves in a position of substantial responsibility with the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive wish to set forth the terms of the Executive’s employment with the Company and enter into this Agreement;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises, the mutual covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.

ARTICLE 1

EMPLOYMENT

1.1 Employment. The Company hereby employs the Executive to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the period stated in Section 1.3 of this Agreement. The Executive hereby accepts employment according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the period stated in Section 1.3 of this Agreement.

1.2 Duties. As President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive shall report directly to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). The Executive shall serve the Company faithfully, diligently, competently, and to the best of the Executive’s ability. It is contemplated by this Agreement that the Executive’s duties shall be comparable to those presently undertaken by the Executive. The duties of employment shall include such additional executive duties on behalf of the Company and its operations of a character in keeping with the Executive’s position as may, from time to time, be assigned to the Executive by the Board. The Executive shall exclusively devote full working time, energy, and attention to the business of the Company and to the promotion of the interest of the Company throughout the term of this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the Board, during the term of this Agreement the Executive shall not render services to or for any person, firm, corporation, or other entity or organization in exchange for compensation, regardless of the form in which the compensation is paid and regardless of whether it is paid directly or indirectly to the Executive. Nothing in this Section 1.2 shall prevent the Executive from managing personal investments and affairs, provided that doing so does not interfere with the proper performance of the Executive’s duties and responsibilities under this Agreement.

1.3 Term.

(a) The term of this Agreement shall include: (i) the initial term, consisting of the period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the “Effective Date”) and ending on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, plus (ii) any and all extensions of the initial term made pursuant to this Section 1.3.

(b) Commencing as of the first anniversary of the Effective Date, and continuing on each anniversary of the Effective Date thereafter, the disinterested members of the Board may extend the  
  
Agreement term for an additional year, so that the remaining term of the Agreement again becomes thirty-six (36) months from the applicable anniversary date, unless the Executive elects not to extend the term of this Agreement by giving proper written notice. The Board will review the Agreement and Executive’s performance annually for purposes of determining whether to extend the Agreement term and will include the rationale and results of its review in the minutes of the meetings. The Board will notify the Executive as soon as possible after each annual review whether it has determined to extend the Agreement.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall mandate or prohibit a continuation of the Executive’s employment following the expiration of the term of this Agreement, upon such terms and conditions as the Company and the Executive may mutually agree.

1.4 Service on the Board of Directors The Executive serves as a member of the Board. The Board shall undertake every lawful effort to ensure that the Executive continues throughout the term of this Agreement to be elected as a director of the Company, provided the Executive remains fit to serve as a director. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Executive agrees that she shall resign as a director of the Company effective immediately after termination of the Executive’s employment under Article 3 of this Agreement. With respect to the preceding sentence, the Executive agrees that her resignation as a director will be effective as of the date her employment with the Company terminates, regardless of whether the Executive submits a formal, written resignation as director.

2.1 Base Salary. In consideration of the Executive’s performance of the obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the Executive a salary at the annual rate of $112,900, payable according to the regular payroll practices of the Company.

ARTICLE 3

EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION

3.1 Termination Because of Death or Disability.

(a) Death. The Executive’s employment shall terminate automatically at the Executive’s death. If the Executive dies in active service to the Company, the Executive’s estate shall receive any sums due to the Executive as Base Salary and reimbursement of expenses through the end of the month in which death occurs.

(b) Disability. By delivery of written notice thirty (30) days in advance to the Executive, the Company may terminate the Executive’s employment due to the Executive’s Disability (as defined below). In the event that the Executive’s employment hereunder terminates due to her Disability, no termination benefits shall be payable to or in respect of the Executive. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean a physical or mental condition due to which the Executive shall have been absent from her duties on a full-time basis for a twelve (12) consecutive month period. The Executive’s employment shall be deemed to have terminated as a result of Disability on the date provided in the notice of termination provided to the Executive by the Company. The Executive shall not be considered Disabled, however, if the Executive has returned to employment on a full-time basis within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice.

3.2 Involuntary Termination with Cause. The board of directors may, by written notice to the Executive, immediately terminate the Executive’s employment under this Agreement at any time for Cause, in which case the Executive shall be entitled to receive only the unpaid Base Salary that has accrued through the date of termination. The Company shall deliver to the Executive a copy of the resolution duly adopted by the board of directors (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive’s counsel, to be heard before the board of directors, such meeting and the opportunity to be heard to be held prior to, or as soon as reasonably practicable following, termination, but in no event later than 30 days following such termination), finding that the Executive was guilty of conduct constituting Cause. The notice provided to the Executive pursuant hereto shall specify in detail the particulars of the conduct constituting Cause. If the board of directors thereafter determines that such conduct did not constitute Cause and the Executive’s employment hereunder is reinstated, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive back pay for the period following termination and continuing through reinstatement. If the Executive’s employment is not reinstated as contemplated by the preceding sentence, then the termination of employment shall be

3  
  
deemed to have occurred pursuant to Section 3.4 of this Agreement and the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits provided therein. For the purposes of this Agreement “Cause” means any of the following:

(1) a material act of personal dishonesty in performing Executive’s duties on behalf of the Company or the Bank;

(2) a willful misconduct that in the judgment of the Board will likely cause economic damage to the Company or the Bank or its affiliates or injury to the business reputation of the Company or the Bank or their affiliates;

(3) a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit;

(4) the intentional failure to perform stated duties under this Agreement after written notice thereof from the board of directors;

(5) a willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than minor or routine traffic violations or similar offenses) that reflects adversely on the reputation of the Company or the Bank or its affiliates, any felony conviction, any violation of law involving moral turpitude, or any violation of a final cease-and-desist order;

(6) a material breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement.

No act, or failure to act, on the Executive’s part shall be considered “willful” unless she has acted, or failed to act, with an absence of good faith and without reasonable belief that her action or failure to act was in the best interest of the Company.

3.3 Voluntary Termination by the Executive Without Good Reason. If the Executive terminates employment without Good Reason, the Executive shall receive the Base Salary and expense reimbursement to which the Executive is entitled through the date on which termination becomes effective.

3.4 Involuntary Termination Without Cause and Voluntary Termination with Good Reason. With written notice to the Executive thirty (30) days in advance, the Company may terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause. Termination shall take effect at the end of the thirty (30) day period. With advance written notice to the Company as provided in clause (y), the Executive may terminate employment for Good Reason. If the Executive’s employment terminates involuntarily without Cause or voluntarily but with Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits specified in Article 4 of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement a voluntary termination by the Executive shall be considered a voluntary termination with Good Reason if the conditions stated in both clauses (x) and (y) of this Section 3.4 are satisfied:

(x) a voluntary termination by the Executive shall be considered a voluntary termination with Good Reason if any of the following occur without the Executive’s written consent, and the term Good Reason shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without the Executive’s written consent:

(1)a material diminution of the Executive’s Base Salary (unless the reduction is part of a Company-wide or executive-level restructuring of compensation),  
  
(2)a material diminution of the Executive’s authority, duties, or responsibilities, or  
  
4  
  
(3)a change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform services for the Company by more than 25 miles from such location at the effective date.  
  
(y) the Executive must give notice to the Company of the existence of one or more of the conditions described in clause (x) within sixty (60) days after the initial existence of the condition, and the Company shall have thirty (30) days thereafter to remedy the condition. In addition, the Executive’s voluntary termination because of the existence of one or more of the conditions described in clause (x) must occur within six (6) months after the initial existence of the condition.

ARTICLE 4

SEVERANCE COMPENSATION

4.1 Cash Severance after Termination Without Cause or Termination for Good Reason.

(a) Subject to the possibility that cash severance after employment termination might be delayed under Section 4.1(b), if the Executive’s employment terminates involuntarily but without Cause or if the Executive voluntarily terminates employment with Good Reason, the Executive shall for thirty-six (36) months and in accordance with the Company’s regular pay practices continue to receive the Base Salary in effect at termination of employment. However, the Company and the Executive acknowledge and agree that the compensation and benefits under this Section 4.1 shall not be payable if compensation and benefits are payable or shall have been paid to the Executive under Article 5 of this Agreement.

(b) If when employment termination occurs the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if the cash severance payment under Section 4.1(a) would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and finally if an exemption from the six-month delay requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not available, the Executive’s continued Base Salary under Section 4.1(a) for the first six months after employment termination shall be paid to the Executive in a single lump sum without interest on the first business day of the seventh (7th) month after the month in which the Executive’s employment terminates.

4.2 Post-Termination Insurance Coverage.

(a) If the Executive’s employment terminates involuntarily but without Cause or voluntarily but with Good Reason, the Company shall continue or cause to be continued at the Company’s expense medical and dental insurance benefits for the Executive and any of her dependents covered at the time of her termination. The medical and dental insurance benefits shall continue until the first to occur of (w) the Executive’s return to employment with the Company or another employer, (x) the Executive’s attainment of age 65, (y) the Executive’s (or dependent’s) death, or (z) the end of the thirty-six (36) month period following her termination of employment.

(b) If (x) under the terms of the applicable policy or policies for the insurance benefits specified in section 4.2(a) it is not possible to continue coverage for the Executive and her dependents, or (y) when employment termination occurs the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if any of the continued insurance coverage benefits specified in Section 4.2(a) would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and finally, if an exemption from the six-month delay requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not available for that particular insurance benefit, the Company shall pay to the Executive in a single lump sum an amount in cash equal to the present value of the Company’s projected cost to maintain that particular insurance benefit (and associated income tax gross-up benefit, if applicable) had the Executive’s employment not terminated, assuming continued coverage for thirty-six (36) months. The lump-sum payment shall be

5  
  
made thirty (30) days after employment termination or, if Section 4.1(b) applies, on the first business day of the seventh (7th) month after the month in which the Executive’s employment terminates.

ARTICLE 5

CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS

5.1 Change in Control Benefits.  If a Change in Control occurs during the term of this Agreement and, thereafter during the then remaining term of the Agreement, the Executive’s employment terminates involuntarily but without Cause or if the Executive voluntarily terminates employment with Good Reason, the Company shall make or cause to be made a lump-sum payment to the Executive in an amount in cash equal to three (3) times the Executive’s average annual compensation. For this purpose, average annual compensation means the Executive’s taxable income reported by the Company or its affiliates for the five (5) calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Change in Control occurs. The payment required under this paragraph is payable no later than five (5) business days after the Executive’s termination of employment. If the Executive receives payment under Section 5.1, the Executive shall not be entitled to any additional severance benefits under Section 4.1 of this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall provide the Executive and her dependents with the same post-termination insurance coverage provided for in Section 4.2 of the Agreement.

5.2 Change in Control Defined. For purposes of this Agreement “Change in Control” means a change in control of the Company or the Bank as defined in Internal Revenue Section 409A of the Code and rules, regulations, and guidance of general application thereunder issued by the Department of the Treasury, including a “change in ownership,” “change in effective control” or “change in ownership of a substantial portion of assets.”

5.3 Potential Limitation of Benefits Under Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to the Executive under this Agreement or otherwise, which are deemed to be parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor thereof (the “Termination Benefits”), would be deemed to include an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, then the Termination Benefits shall be reduced to a value which is one dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times the Executive’s “base amount,” as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code. The allocation of the reduction required hereby among the Termination Benefits shall first be made from any cash severance benefit due under Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall result in a reduction of any payments or benefits to which the Executive may be entitled upon termination of employment other than pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 hereof, or a reduction in the payments and benefits specified, below zero.

ARTICLE 6

CONFIDENTIALITY AND CREATIVE WORK

6.1 Non-disclosure. The Executive covenants and agrees not to reveal to any person, firm, or corporation any confidential information of any nature concerning the Company or the Bank or its business, or anything connected therewith. As used in this Article 6 the term “confidential information” means all of the Company’s or the Bank’s and the Company’s affiliates’ confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets in existence on the date hereof or existing at any time during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to:

(a) the whole or any portion or phase of any business plans, financial information, purchasing data, supplier data, accounting data, or other financial information,

6.2 Return of Materials.  The Executive agrees to immediately deliver or return to the Company upon termination, upon expiration of this Agreement, or as soon thereafter as possible, all written information and any other similar items furnished by the Company or prepared by the Executive in connection with the Executive’s services hereunder and to immediately delete all electronically stored data of the Company maintained on the Executive’s personal computers and to return all Company-provided computers or communication devices (i.e., laptop, Blackberry, PDA, etc.). The Executive will retain no copies thereof after termination of this Agreement or termination of the Executive’s employment.

6.3 Creative Work. The Executive agrees that all creative work and work product, including but not limited to all technology, business management tools, processes, software, patents, trademarks, and copyrights developed by the Executive during the term of this Agreement, regardless of when or where such work or work product was produced, constitutes work made for hire, all rights of which are owned by the Company. The Executive hereby assigns to the Company all rights, title, and interest, whether by way of copyrights, trade secret, trademark, patent, or otherwise, in all such work or work product, regardless of whether the same is subject to protection by patent, trademark, or copyright laws.

6.4 Affiliates’ Confidential Information is Covered; Confidentiality Obligation Survives Termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “affiliate” of the Company includes any entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. The rights and obligations set forth in this Article 6 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

6.5 Injunctive Relief. The Executive acknowledges that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that will accrue to the Company if the Executive fails to observe the obligations imposed by this Article 6. Accordingly, if the Company institutes an action to enforce the provisions hereof, the Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law is available to the Company, and the Executive agrees not to urge in any such action the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists. The confidentiality and remedies provisions of this Article 6 shall be in addition to and shall not be deemed to supersede or restrict, limit, or impair the Company’s rights under applicable state or federal statute or regulation dealing with or providing a remedy for the wrongful disclosure, misuse, or misappropriation of trade secrets or proprietary or confidential information.

ARTICLE 7

COMPETITION AFTER EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION

7.1 Covenant Not to Solicit Employees. The Executive agrees not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or employ the services of any officer or employee of the Company (including an

(c) The Executive acknowledges that the Company’s willingness to enter into this Agreement and to make the payments contemplated by Articles 3 and 4 of this Agreement is conditioned on the Executive’s acceptance of the covenants set forth in Articles 6 and 7 of this Agreement and that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement without such covenants in force.

7.3 Injunctive and Other Relief. Because of the unique character of the services to be rendered by the Executive hereunder, the Executive understands that the Company would not have an adequate remedy at law for the material breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any one or more of the Executive’s covenants in this Article 7. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that the Company’s remedies for a breach of this Article 7 include, but are not limited to, (x) forfeiture of any money representing accrued salary, contingent payments, or other fringe benefits (including any amount payable pursuant to Article 4) due and payable to the Executive during the period of any breach by Executive, and (y) a suit in equity by the Company to enjoin the Executive from the breach or threatened breach of such covenants. The Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law is available to the Company and the Executive agrees not to urge in any such action the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any other or additional remedies for the breach or threatened breach.

7.4 Article 7 Survives Termination But Is Void After a Change in Control. The rights and obligations set forth in this Article 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement. However, Article 7 shall become null and void effective immediately upon a Change in Control.

No waiver or any breach of this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

8.9 Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

(a) The Executive will be deemed to have a termination of employment for purposes of determining the timing of any payments that are classified as deferred compensation only upon a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.

(b) If at the time of the Executive’s separation from service, (i) the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A and using the methodology selected by the Company) and (ii) the Company makes a good faith determination that an amount payable or the benefits to be provided hereunder constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A), the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to the six-month delay rule of Section 409A in order to avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A, then the Company will not pay the entire amount on the otherwise scheduled payment date but will instead pay on the scheduled payment date the maximum amount permissible in order to comply with Section 409A (i.e., any amount that satisfies an exception under the Section 409A rules from being categorized as deferred compensation) and will pay the remaining amount (if any) in a lump sum on the first business day after such six month period.

(c) To the extent the Executive would be subject to an additional 20% tax imposed on certain deferred compensation arrangements pursuant to Section 409A as a result of any provision of this Agreement, such provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to avoid application of such tax and the parties shall promptly execute any amendment reasonably necessary to implement this Section 8.9. The Executive and the Company agree to cooperate to make such amendment to the terms of this Agreement as may be necessary to avoid the imposition of penalties and taxes under Section 409A; provided, however, that the Executive agrees that any such amendment shall provide the Executive with economically equivalent payments and benefits, and the Executive agrees that any such amendment will not materially increase the cost to, or liability of, the Company with respect to any payment.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, Section 409A shall refer to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury regulations and any other authoritative guidance issued thereunder.

8.10 Required Provisions. Any payments made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to, and conditioned upon, their compliance with 12 U.S.C. Section 1828(k) and FDIC Regulation 12 C.F.R. Part 359, Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments.

8.11 Source of Payments. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent payments and benefits, as provided for under this Agreement, are paid or received by the Executive under an employment agreement in effect between the Executive and the Bank, the payments and benefits paid by the Bank will be subtracted from any amount or benefit due simultaneously to the Executive under similar provisions of this Agreement. Payments will be allocated in proportion to the level of activity and the time expended by the Executive on activities related to the Company and the Bank, respectively, as determined by the Company and the Bank.
