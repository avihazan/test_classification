EXHIBIT 10.2 

ALTERA CORPORATION 



2005 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

(Director Form) 

Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in Altera’s 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) shall have the same defined meanings in this Award Agreement (the “Agreement”). 

You have been granted an option to purchase Shares (the “Option”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Notice of Stock Option Grant (“Notice of Grant”) and this Agreement. 

1\. Vesting Rights. Subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, this Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 

2\. Termination Period. 

(a) General Rule. Except as provided below, and subject to Section 22.4 of the Plan, this Option may be exercised for 90 days after termination of Participant’s employment with the Company. In no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Term/Expiration Date set forth in the Notice of Grant. 

(b) Death; Disability. Upon the termination of Participant’s employment with the Company by reason of his or her Disability or death, or if a Participant dies within 30 days of the Termination Date, this Option may be exercised for twelve months after the Termination Date, provided that in no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Term/Expiration Date set forth in the Notice of Grant. 

3\. Grant of Option. The Participant named in the Notice of Grant has been granted an Option for the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Exercise Price”). Subject to Section 24 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail. 

If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option (“ISO”), this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. However, if this Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section 422(d) it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option (“NSO”). 

4\. Exercise of Option. 

(a) Right to Exercise. This Option is exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant and the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. In the event of Participant’s death, Disability or other termination of Participant’s employment relationship, the exercisability of the Option is governed by the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

(b) Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice (the “Exercise Notice”), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be delivered in person, by mail, via electronic mail or facsimile or by other authorized

method to the Secretary of the Company or other person designated by the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price. 

No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation service upon which the Shares are then listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Participant on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. 

5\. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Participant: 

(a) cash; or 

(b) check; or 

(c) “same day sale” (as described in Section 11(e)(1) of the Plan); or 

(d) surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares; or 

(e) other method authorized by the Company. 

6\. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or court order and may be exercised during the lifetime of Participant only by the Participant. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Participant. 

7\. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Notice of Grant, the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. 

8\. U.S. Tax Consequences. For Participants subject to U.S. income tax, some of the federal and California tax consequences relating to this Option, as of the date of this Option, are set forth below. All other Participants should consult a tax advisor for tax consequences relating to this Option in their respective jurisdiction. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES. 

(a) Exercising the Option. 

(i) Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Participant may incur regular federal income tax and California income tax liability upon exercise of a NSO. The Participant will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise Price. If the Participant is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be required to withhold from his or her compensation or collect from Participant and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage of this compensation income at the time of exercise, and may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are not delivered at the time of exercise.

(ii) Incentive Stock Option. If this Option qualifies as an ISO, the Participant will have no regular federal income tax or California income tax liability upon its exercise, although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to alternative minimum taxable income for federal tax purposes and may subject the Participant to alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise. 

(b) Disposition of Shares. 

(i) NSO. If the Participant holds NSO Shares for at least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. 

(ii) ISO. If the Participant holds ISO Shares for at least one year after exercise and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. If the Participant disposes of ISO Shares within one year after exercise or two years after the grant date, any gain realized on such disposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and the aggregate Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale price of such Shares and the aggregate Exercise Price. 

(c) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. If the Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to an ISO on or before the later of (i) two years after the grant date, or (ii) one year after the exercise date, the Participant shall immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. The Participant agrees that he or she may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income recognized from such early disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash or out of the current earnings paid to the Participant. 

9\. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan, the Notice of Grant, and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Participant with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Participant’s interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and Participant. This agreement is governed by California law except for that body of law pertaining to conflict of laws. 

10\. NO GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT. PARTICIPANT UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS FOR AN UNSPECIFIED DURATION AND CONSTITUTES “AT-WILL” EMPLOYMENT. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING SERVICE AS AN EMPLOYEE AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED AN OPTION OR PURCHASING SHARES HEREUNDER). PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH PARTICIPANT’S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY’S AND/OR SUBSIDIARY’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT’S EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
