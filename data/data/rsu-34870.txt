* * *

5\. CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event of a Change in Control, the Restricted Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 24 of the Plan. 

6\. SECTION 83(B). If Participant properly elects (as required by Section 83(b) of the Code) within 30 days after the Grant Date to include in Participant’s gross income for federal income tax purposes in the year of issuance the fair market value of the Restricted Stock, Participant shall pay to the Corporation or make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation to pay to the Corporation upon such election, any foreign, federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock. If Participant shall fail to make such payment, the Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock. Participant acknowledges that it is Participant’s sole responsibility, and not the Corporation’s responsibility, to file timely and properly the election under Section 83(b) of the Code and any corresponding provisions of state tax laws if Participant elects to make such election, and Participant agrees to provide the Corporation with a copy of any such election within ten (10) calendar days of making such election. 

7\. RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. Except for the potential forfeitability of the Restricted Stock before the occurrence of a Vesting Date, Participant has all rights of a stockholder (including voting and dividend rights) commencing on the Grant Date, subject to Participant’s execution of this Agreement. With respect to any dividends that are paid with respect to the Restricted Stock between the date of this Agreement and the end of any applicable restricted period, such dividends (whether payable in cash or shares) shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock, including any forfeiture provisions described in Section 2 hereof. 

8\. ADJUSTMENTS. In the event of any stock dividend, reclassification, subdivision or combination, or similar transaction affecting this Award, the rights of the Participant will be adjusted as provided in Section 5(d) of the Plan. 

9\. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD. Without the express written consent of the Committee, which may be withheld for any reason in its sole discretion, the Restricted Stock may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the Participant’s executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns. Any attempt to transfer the Restricted Stock in any manner, contrary to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and/or the Plan shall be null and void and without legal force or effect. 

10\. RESTRICTED STOCK CERTIFICATE LEGEND. The Company will either issue a stock certificate or certificates representing the Shares (the “Certificate”) and register the Certificate in the Participant’s name, or make such other arrangements with its stock transfer agent to issue uncertificated interests, including in book-entry form (“Book Entry”). If a Certificate is issued, it will be deposited with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in blank by the Participant. A legend will be placed upon such Certificate as provided below. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Award, upon the lapse of the restricted 

* * *

period applicable to such Shares or any portion of them (prior to cancelation and forfeiture), the Company will cause the Certificate deposited with the Company to be reissued and delivered to the Participant without such legend. If a Book Entry is made, the Company will issue “stop transfer” instructions with respect to the Shares until the lapse of the restricted period applicable to such Shares or any portion of them (prior to cancelation and forfeiture). Each Certificate representing shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Agreement shall initially bear the following legend: 

“THE SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, WHETHER VOLUNTARY, INVOLUNTARY, OR BY OPERATION OF LAW, IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE GENTHERM INCORPORATED 2013 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AND IN A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT DATED , 20 . A COPY OF THE PLAN AND SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF GENTHERM INCORPORATED.”

Except as addressed in furtherance of Section 6, at the time this Award vests, in whole or in part, and at any time before or thereafter as requested by the Corporation, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Corporation or an Affiliate, if any, which arise in connection with the vesting of this Award. The Participant will not be entitled to receive and the Corporation will have no obligation to issue a certificate for any shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Award unless and until the tax withholding obligations of the Corporation and/or any Affiliate are satisfied. 

12\. THE PLAN; AMENDMENT. This Award is subject in all respects to the terms, conditions, limitations and definitions contained in the Plan. In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between this Agreement and the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall control. The Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or amend this Agreement from time to time in accordance with and as provided in the Plan. This Agreement may also be modified or amended by a writing signed by both the Corporation and the Participant. The Corporation shall give written notice to the Participant of any such modification or amendment of this Agreement as soon as practicable after the adoption thereof.

15\. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be legally binding and shall be executed and construed and its provisions enforced and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Michigan.

This authorization and consent is freely given by the Participant. 

17\. BINDING AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be binding upon, and be enforceable by the Corporation and its successors and assigns. The Participant shall not assign (except in accordance with Section 9 hereof) any part of this Agreement without the prior express written consent of the Corporation.

19\. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

20\. SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or the validity, legality or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, it being intended that all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

21\. ACQUIRED RIGHTS.

22\. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS; COMPENSATION RECOVERY. By signing this Agreement, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Restricted Stock subject to this Award or any Award previously granted to Participant by the Corporation or a Subsidiary shall (1) be subject to forfeiture as a result of the Participant’s violation of any agreement with the Corporation regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, inventions and/or other restrictive covenants (the “Restricted Covenant Agreements”), and (2) shall be subject to forfeiture and/or recovery under any compensation recovery policy that may be adopted from time to time by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. For avoidance of doubt, compensation 

* * *

recovery rights to Shares (including Shares acquired under previously granted equity awards) shall extend to the proceeds realized by the Participant due to the sale or other transfer of Shares. The Participant’s prior execution of the Restricted Covenant Agreements was a material inducement for the Corporation’s grant of this Award.
