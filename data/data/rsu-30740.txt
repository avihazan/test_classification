Such notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price of such shares, which payment shall be made in cash or by check or bank draft payable to the Company. In the sole discretion of the Company, the Optionee may pay the purchase price by delivering shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the optionee (which in the case of stock acquired upon exercise of an option have been owned for more than six months on the date of surrender) with a fair market value equal to the purchase price or by a combination of cash and such shares, whose fair market value shall equal the purchase price.

In the event the Option shall be exercised by any person other than the Optionee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of such right of such person to exercise the Option. All shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and nonassessable. 

9. Option Plan. This Option is subject to certain additional terms and conditions set forth in the Plan pursuant to which this Option has been issued. A copy of the Plan is on file with the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and each Option holder by acceptance hereof agrees to and accepts this Option subject to the terms of the Plan.  
  
10. General. The Company shall at all times during the term of the Option reserve and keep available such number of shares of Common Stock as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Option Agreement, shall pay all original issue and transfer taxes with respect to the issue and transfer of shares pursuant hereto and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith, and will from time to time use its best efforts to comply with all laws and regulations which, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, shall be applicable thereto.  
  
11. Status. Neither the Optionee nor the Optionee’s executor, administrator, heirs, or legatees, shall be or have any rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company in respect of the shares transferable upon exercise of the Option granted hereunder, unless and until certificates representing such shares shall be endorsed, transferred, and delivered and the transferee has caused the Optionee’s name to be entered as the shareholder of record on the books of the Company.  
  
12. Common Authority. The existence of the Option herein granted shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its shareholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Company’s capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Common Stock of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

(b) “Disability” means disabled within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code as determined by the Committee. 

(c) “Retirement” means retirement from active employment with the Company and any Affiliate of the Company either (i) on or after age 65, or (ii) with consent of the Committee at the time of retirement. 

This stock option agreement could be construed to imply that Lifecore expects long term continued financial appreciation in its common stock price in the public equity marketplace. As such, it constitutes a forward looking document as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties in Lifecore’s business activity, the Company’s actual business results may differ materially from those implied. Prospective stock option investors are cautioned to refer to more detailed discussions of Lifecore’s specific business risks as presented and updated from time to time in the Company’s reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. In addition, even if Lifecore’s business performance does improve, the potential option investor is cautioned that the public stock marketplace may not reflect those improvements in an appreciated price for Lifecore’s common stock.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Optionee have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
