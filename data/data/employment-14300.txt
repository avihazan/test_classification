Warranties. Employee hereby represents and warrants that he or she has taken no confidential, proprietary or trade secret information from Employee’s prior employer or employers, and will not knowingly disclose such information to the Company, or improperly use any such information on behalf of the Company.

Employee acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf induced or solicited Employee to breach any contract or other enforceable obligation in connection with any proposed employment with the Company.

Moral Rights and other intellectual property rights in connection therewith. As used herein, “Moral Rights” means any rights to claim authorship of an invention, to object to or prevent the modification of any Invention, or to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of any invention, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred to as a “moral right.” Employee understands that any inventions, discoveries or ideas that Employee has created or possessed prior to Employee’s employment by the Company are specified in Appendix A attached to this Agreement and will not be considered to be the property of the Company.  
  
9\. 

Inventions Not Assigned. In accordance with California Labor Code Section 2870, this Agreement does not require the assignment of an invention which qualifies fully for protection under Section 2870, which provides as follows:  
  
(A) ANY PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT AN EMPLOYEE SHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR HER EMPLOYER SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON HIS OR HER OWN TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE INVENTIONS THAT EITHER:  
  
(1) RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION TO THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS, OR ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPLOYER; OR  
  
(2) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER.  
  
(B) TO THE EXTENT A PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PURPORTS TO REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO ASSIGN AN INVENTION OTHERWISE EXCLUDED FROM BEING REQUIRED TO BE ASSIGNED UNDER SUBDIVISION (A), THE PROVISION IS AGAINST THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.  
  
10\. 

Assistance. Employee will assist the Company in every proper way to obtain for the Company and enforce all patents, copyrights, mask work rights, trade secret rights and other legal protections for the assigned inventions in any and all countries. Employee will execute any documents that the Company may reasonably request for use in obtaining or enforcing such patents, copyrights, mask work rights, trade secrets and other legal protections. Employee’s obligations under this section will continue beyond the termination of employment with the Company, provided that the Company will compensate Employee upon the Company’s request of such assistance. Employee hereby appoints the Secretary of the Company as Employee’s attorney-in-fact to execute documents on Employee’s behalf to effect the obligations of Employee under this Section 10.

11\. 

Confidential, Proprietary, and Trade Secret Information. During the course of employment, Employee will come into possession of or acquire knowledge of confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company. Employee hereby covenants and agrees that Employee will not, either during the term of employment or at any time thereafter, disclose any such confidential, proprietary or trade secret information to any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership or other entity (other than those in the Company’s organization qualified and authorized to receive such information) for any purpose or reason whatsoever. Such confidential and proprietary information shall be deemed to include, but not be limited to, (i) Company products, designs, software, software codes, software developments, research projects, improvements and methods of operation, (ii) business plans, marketing plans and related information, (iii) the names, lists, buying habits and practices of the Company’s customers, clients and vendors, and the relationships between them and the Company, (iv) the Company’s financial condition, profit performance and financial requirements, and (v) all other confidential information of, about or concerning the Company, the manner of operation of the Company and other confidential data of any kind, nature or description relating to the Company. Employee specifically agrees not to make use of any such confidential or proprietary information for Employee’s own purpose, or for the benefit of any person, firm, corporation or other entity except the Company. Employee will abide by the Company’s policies and procedures, as established from time to time for the protection of its trade secrets and confidential information. Employee does not know of any of the Company’s confidential, proprietary or trade secret information other than the information learned from the Company. Further, Employee agrees to be bound by, and to execute such additional instruments as may be necessary or desirable to evidence Employee’s agreement to be bound by, all nondisclosure or similar covenants between the Company and any third party.  
  
12\. 

Return of Property. All confidential, proprietary and trade secret information, and all other documents, records, apparatus, equipment and other physical property which is furnished to or obtained by Employee in the course of employment with the Company shall be and remain the sole property of the Company. Employee agrees that, upon termination of his or her employment, Employee shall return all such property and agrees not to make or retain copies, reproductions or summaries of any such property without the express written consent of the Company.  
  
13\. 

Non-Solicitation. For a period of two years immediately following the termination of this Agreement, Employee agrees not to, either directly or indirectly, attempt to recruit, solicit or take away any of the employees of the Company who worked for the Company at any time during the term of this Agreement; make known to any person, firm or corporation the names or addresses of, or any information pertaining to, any current or former employees of the Company; attempt to call on, solicit or take away any customers of the Company or any other persons, corporations or other entities with which the Company has had or contemplated any business transaction or relationship during his or her employment with the Company, including, but not limited to, investments, licenses, joint ventures, and agreements for development, with the use of any proprietary or confidential information or trade secret of the Company, for purposes of entering into any business transaction or relationship with any such customers or other persons, corporations, or other entities.  
  
14\. 

Equitable Relief. Employee and the Company agree that in the event of any breach of paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 of this Agreement, the Company and Employee will not have an adequate remedy at law. Thus, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the Company and/or Employee will be entitled to such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available to prevent and restrain the breach of the provisions of said paragraphs. Such availability to obtain injunctive relief will not prevent the Company or Employee from pursuing any other equitable or legal relief, including the recovery of damages from such breach or threatened breach.  
  
15\. 

At-Will Employment. Employee’s Employment at the Company is at will. This means that employment may be terminated with or without Cause and with or without notice at any time by either the Employee or the Company. Nothing in this or any other document or statement shall limit the right to terminate employment at will. No officer, manager, supervisor or employee of the Company has any authority to enter into an agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make an agreement for employment other than at-will. Only the CEO of the Company has the authority to make any such agreement and then only in a writing that expressly modifies the policy of at-will employment. For purposes of this Agreement, any of the following shall constitute “Cause”: (i) willful or habitual breach of or failure to perform Employee's duties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii) fraud, dishonesty,

Severability. Should any provision or part of this Agreement be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions and parts shall be unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect, and said invalid, void or unenforceable provision or part shall be deemed not to be part of this Agreement.

Appendix B

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Policy and Agreement

1\. 

Agreement to Arbitrate.  
  
1.1. 

In the event that any employment dispute arises between AdEx Media, Inc. (“Company”) and Kevin Dufficy (“Employee”), the parties involved will make all efforts to resolve any such dispute through informal means. If these informal attempts at resolution fail and if the dispute arises out of or is related to the parties’ Employment Agreement, the termination of Employee’s employment or alleged unlawful discrimination, including but not limited to unlawful harassment, the Company and Employee will submit the dispute to final and binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California, except as set forth in paragraph 14 of the Employment Agreement.  
  
1.2. 

The parties expressly understand and agree that arbitration is the exclusive remedy for all such disputes; with respect to such disputes, no other action may be brought in court or any other forum (except actions to compel arbitration hereunder). THIS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (“ADR”) AGREEMENT IS A WAIVER OF THE PARTIES’ RIGHTS TO A CIVIL COURT ACTION FOR A DISPUTE RELATING TO BREACH OF THE PARTIES’ EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, TERMINATION OF THAT EMPLOYMENT OR ALLEGED UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, WHICH INCLUDES RETALIATION OR SEXUAL OR OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT; ONLY AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, WILL DECIDE THE DISPUTE.  
  
1.3. 

Employment disputes arising out of or related to termination of employment or alleged unlawful discrimination, including retaliation or sexual or other unlawful harassment, shall include, but not be limited to, the following: alleged violations of federal, state and/or local constitutions, statutes or regulations; claims based on any purported breach of contractual obligation, including breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims based on any purported breach of duty arising in tort, including violations of public policy. Disputes related to workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance are not arbitrable hereunder. Claims for benefits covered by a separate benefit plan that provides for arbitration are not covered by this ADR Agreement. Also, nothing in the Employment Agreement or in the ADR Policy shall be construed as precluding Employee from filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) or other federal, state or local agencies, seeking administrative assistance in resolving claims. However, any claim that cannot be resolved administratively through such an agency shall be subject to the Employment Agreement and this ADR Policy and Agreement.  
  
2\. 

Request for Arbitration.  
  
2.1. 

Attempt at Informal Resolution of Disputes. Prior to submission of any dispute to arbitration, Employee and the Company shall attempt to resolve the dispute informally as follows: Employee and the Company will select a mediator from a list provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or other similar agency who will assist the parties in attempting to reach a settlement of the dispute. The mediator may make settlement suggestions to the parties but shall not have the power to impose a settlement upon them. If the dispute is resolved in mediation, the matter shall be deemed closed. If the dispute is not resolved in mediation and goes to the next step (binding arbitration), any proposals or compromises suggested by either of the parties or the mediator shall not be referred to in or have any bearing on the arbitration procedure. The mediator cannot also serve as the arbitrator in any subsequent proceeding unless all parties expressly agree in writing.  
  
ADR Policy and Agreement: Page 1

2.2. 

Arbitration Procedures. The party desiring arbitration, whether Employee or the Company, must submit a “Request For Arbitration” in writing to the other party within the time period required by the law that applies to the claim under the applicable statute of limitations. If the “Request for Arbitration” is not submitted in accordance with the aforementioned time limitations, the party failing to do so will not be able to bring that party’s claims to this or any other forum. The “Request for Arbitration” form must, unless otherwise required by law, clearly state “Request for Arbitration” at the beginning of the first page and include the following information:  
  
(a) 

A factual description of the dispute in sufficient detail to advise the other party of the nature of the dispute;  
  
(b) 

The date on which the dispute first arose;  
  
(c) 

The names, work locations and telephone numbers of any individuals, including employees or supervisors, with knowledge of the dispute; and  
  
(d) 

The relief requested by the requesting party.  
  
The responding party may submit counterclaim(s) in like manner in accordance with applicable law.

2.3. 

Selection of Arbitrator. All disputes will be resolved by a single Arbitrator, who will be mutually selected by the Company and Employee. If the parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then a list of five arbitrators, experienced in employment matters, shall be provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The Arbitrator will be selected by the parties who will alternately strike names from the list. The last name remaining on the list will be the Arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute. Upon selection, the Arbitrator shall set an appropriate time, date and place for the arbitration, after conferring with the parties to the dispute.  
  
2.4.

(c) 

To issue protective orders on the motion of any party or third-party witness.

(d) 

To determine only the issue(s) submitted to him/her. The issue(s) must be identifiable in the “Request for Arbitration” or counterclaim(s). Except as required by law, any issue(s) not identifiable in those documents is outside the scope of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction and any award involving such issue(s), upon motion by a party, shall be vacated.  
  
2.5. 

Discovery. The discovery process shall proceed and be governed, consistent with the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as follows:

Unless otherwise required by law, the parties may obtain discovery by any of the methods allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
  
(b) 

To the extent permitted by the Federal Arbitration Act or applicable California law, each party shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and documents during discovery and for the arbitration.  
  
(c) 

All discovery requests shall be submitted no less than sixty (60) days before the hearing date.  
  
ADR Policy and Agreement: Page 2

2.6. 

Hearing Procedure. The hearing shall be held at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, or as determined by the Arbitrator in the absence of an agreement, and shall proceed according to the American Arbitration Association’s “National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes” in effect at the time of the arbitration, with the following amendments:  
  
(a) 

The Arbitrator shall rule at the outset of the arbitration on procedural issues that bear on whether the arbitration is allowed to proceed.  
  
(b)

(c) 

In addition to, or in lieu of, closing argument, either party shall have the right to present a post-hearing brief, and the deadline for exchanging any post-hearing briefs shall be mutually agreed on by the parties and the Arbitrator, or determined by the Arbitrator in the absence of agreement.  
  
2.7. 

Substantive Law.  
  
(a) 

The parties agree that they will be afforded the identical legal, equitable, and statutory remedies as would be afforded them were they to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction.  
  
(b)
