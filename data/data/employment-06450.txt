Employee expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by Employee of this Section 2 will be inadequate and that damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon Employee’s violation of any provision of this Section 2 the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction immediate injunctive relief and obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach as well as an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such violation.

(h) SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Section 2 shall, to the extent provided in this Section 2, survive the termination or expiration of Employee’s employment with the Company and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 2 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state. 

3\. TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

6\. HEADING REFERENCES. Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose. 

7\. WAIVER; MODIFICATION. Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the assignment of Employee to a different Reporting Officer due to a reorganization or an internal restructuring of the Company or its affiliated companies nor a change in the title of the Reporting Officer shall constitute a modification or a breach of this Agreement. 

8\. SEVERABILITY If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement. 

9\. SECTION 409A. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any regulations and guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”), to the extent Section 409A is applicable to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered by the Company in a manner consistent with such intention and to avoid the pre-distribution inclusion in income of amounts deferred under this Agreement and the imposition of any additional tax or interest with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable under this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the date of termination of Employee’s employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Employee’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.
