(b) In the event of a registration of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact which was furnished in writing by the Purchaser to the Company expressly for use in (and such information is contained in) the Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such person for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that the Purchaser will be liable in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Purchaser specifically for use in any such document. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any person or entity in excess of the amount of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Purchaser in respect of Registrable Securities in connection with any such registration under the Securities Act.

(c) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to claim indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against a party hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (an "Indemnifying Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party other than under this Section 5(c) and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) if and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; if the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, then the Indemnified Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of such counsel, provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select one separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. 

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in the event of joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) the Purchaser, or any officer, director or controlling person of the Purchaser, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 5 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of the Purchaser or such officer, director or controlling person of the Purchaser in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 5; then, and in each such case, the Company and the Purchaser will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that the Purchaser is responsible only for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its securities offered by the Registration Statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such Registration Statement, provided, however, that, in any such case, (A) the Purchaser will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration Statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

6. Representations and Warranties of Purchaser.

(a) Purchaser agrees to provide the Company any information or assistance requested by the Company in order to file or complete the Registration Statement.

7. Miscellaneous.

(a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder, of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. 

(b) No Piggyback on Registrations. Neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall not after the date hereof enter into any agreement providing any such right for inclusion of shares in the Registration Statement to any of its security holders. The Company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities to any Person that have not been fully satisfied. 

(c) Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.

(d) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of a Discontinuation Event (as defined below), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the applicable Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this paragraph. For purposes of this Section 7(d), a "Discontinuation Event" shall mean (i) when the Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a "review" of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration Statement (the Company shall provide true and complete copies thereof and all written responses thereto to each of the Holders); (ii) any request by the Commission or any other Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose; and/or (v) the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the financial statements included in such Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement or Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(e) Piggy-Back Registrations. If at any time during the Effectiveness Period there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each Holder written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days after receipt of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such holder requests to be registered to the extent the Company may do so without violating registration rights of others which exist as of the date of this Agreement, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights and subject to obtaining any required the consent of any selling stockholder(s) to such inclusion under such registration statement.

(f) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the Holders of the then outstanding Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of certain Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.

Re:

[Company Name]. Registration Statement on Form [S-3]  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen:

As counsel to[company name] , a Delaware corporation (the åCompanyæ), we have been requested to render our opinion to you in connection with the resale by the individuals or entitles listed on Schedule A attached hereto (the åSelling Stockholdersæ), of an aggregate of [amount]shares (the åSharesæ) of the Company’s Common Stock.

A Registration Statement on Form [S-3] under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the åActæ), with respect to the resale of the Shares was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on [date]. Enclosed is the Prospectus dated [date]. We understand that the Shares are to be offered and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus.

Based upon the foregoing, upon request by the Selling Stockholders at any time while the registration statement remains effective, it is our opinion that the Shares have been registered for resale under the Act and new certificates evidencing the Shares upon their transfer or re-registration by the Selling Stockholders may be issued without restrictive legend. We will advise you if the registration statement is not available or effective at any point in the future.

Very truly yours,

  


  


[Company counsel]
