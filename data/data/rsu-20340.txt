Final Exercise Date: 5:00 p.m. ET on 

Except as otherwise indicated by the context, “Grantee” shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms. If the Option Type listed above is “Non-qualified Stock Option” or “NQ,” then this option shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code. If the Option Type listed above is “Incentive Stock Option” or “ISO,” then this option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee ceases to be an Employee of the Company or any corporate Subsidiary but continues to provide Service, this option will be deemed a Non-qualified Stock Option as of the date 3 months and 1 day after the Grantee ceases to be an Employee of the Company or any corporate Subsidiary. In addition, to the extent that all or part of an option intended to be an “Incentive Stock Option” exceeds the “$100,000 per year limitation” rule of Section 422(d) of the Code, the option or the lesser excess part will be deemed to be a Non-qualified Stock Option. 

This option is granted in consideration of Service rendered and to be rendered by the Grantee to the Company or an Affiliate. This option is subject to the terms of this agreement and the Company’s 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Plan”), a copy of which is furnished to the Grantee with this agreement. Any capitalized term that is not defined in this agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Plan. 

2\. Vesting Schedule. 

This option will become exercisable (“vest”) for the Shares and on the dates indicated on Schedule A to this agreement, provided that the Grantee continues to provide Service to the Company or an Affiliate on such dates and has provided Service at all times since the Grant Date. 

3\. Exercise of Option. 

(a) Right of Exercise. The Grantee’s right of exercise will be cumulative so that to the extent this option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible, this option will continue to be exercisable with respect to any remaining Shares for which it is vested until this option terminates. No partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional Share or for fewer than ten whole Shares.

(c) Payment of Option Price and Withholding Taxes. The Grantee must pay to the Company the Option Price and, if the Grantee is an Employee, all applicable federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of this option or the Shares:   
  
– in cash;   
– by delivery (on a form acceptable to the Company) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell Shares and to deliver proceeds from such sale to the Company in payment of the Option Price and all applicable withholding taxes; or   
– if the Grantee is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, by tender of previously acquired and unencumbered shares of the Company’s Stock equal in value to the Option Price and all applicable withholding taxes.   
  
In addition, the Company may deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Grantee the Option Price and all applicable withholding taxes in respect of this option or the Shares. The Company may, in its discretion, permit the Grantee to make alternative arrangements for payment of such amounts. The Grantee understands that the Grantee (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Grantee’s own tax liability that may result from this investment or the transactions contemplated by this agreement.

(b) Death or Disability. If the Grantee ceases to provide Service due to his or her death or disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) and the Company has not terminated the Grantee for Cause, this option will terminate on the earlier of (1) 5:00 p.m. ET on the date that is exactly 1 year after the Grantee ceases to provide Service due to his or her death or disability and (2) the Final Exercise Date.   
  
(c) Certain Other Terminations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee violates the non-competition, confidentiality or non-solicitation provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement, or other agreement between the Grantee and the Company, this option will terminate immediately upon such violation.
