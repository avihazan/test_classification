The Holders shall not be obligated to comply with the provisions of this Section 2.1 more than two times in any 12-month period.

## 

# SECTION 3. INDEMNIFICATION.

# 

## 3.1 Indemnification by SkyTerra. SkyTerra agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each of the Holders, its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and each Person who controls the Holders (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement or any prospectus forming a part of the Resale Registration Statement or any “issuer free writing prospectus” (as defined in Securities Act Rule 433), or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or any violation or alleged violation by SkyTerra of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or applicable “blue sky” laws, 

5

* * *

  


## except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with any information furnished in writing to SkyTerra by the Holders expressly for use therein or by the failure of the Holders to deliver a copy of such registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto as required by law after SkyTerra has furnished the Holders with a sufficient number of copies of the same.

## 

## 3.2 Indemnification by the Holders. In connection with the Resale Registration Statement in which any Holder is participating, each such Holder shall furnish to SkyTerra in writing such information as SkyTerra reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder shall indemnify SkyTerra, its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates, and each Person who controls SkyTerra (within the meaning of the Securities Act), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement, the prospectus or preliminary prospectus forming a part of the Resale Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent that any information so furnished in writing by such Holder contains such untrue statement or omits a material fact required to be stated therein necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the obligation of any Holder to indemnify SkyTerra hereunder shall be limited to the net proceeds to such Holder from the sale of such Holder’s Acquired Shares pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement.

## 

## 3.3 Indemnification Procedures. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person’s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party that are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another indemnified party with respect to such claim. Failure to give prompt written notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations hereunder.

## 

## 3.4 Investigation; Contribution. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, or controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. If the indemnification provided under Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 of this Agreement is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable 

6

* * *

  


## indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, and by such party’s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. In no event shall the liability of the Holders for contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4 be greater than the amount for which the Holders would have been liable pursuant to Section 3.2 had indemnification been available and enforceable.

## 

# SECTION 4. RULE 144 TRANSACTIONS.

# 

## 4.1 Undertaking to File Reports and Cooperate in Rule 144 Transactions. For as long as the Holders continue to hold any Acquired Shares, SkyTerra shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, on a timely basis, all annual, quarterly and other periodic reports required to be filed by it under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to require SkyTerra to prepare and file periodic reports if it is not required to do so under the Exchange Act. In the event of any proposed sale by the Holders of Acquired Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or otherwise as provided herein, which sale is to be made in accordance with the terms of Section 5.1(b) hereof, SkyTerra shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Holders so as to enable such sales to be made in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the requirements of the transfer agent of SkyTerra, and the reasonable requirements of the broker through which the sales are proposed to be executed, and shall, upon written request, furnish unlegended certificates representing ownership of Acquired Shares sold thereby, such certificates to be furnished in such numbers and denominations as the Holders may reasonably request.

## 

# SECTION 5. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER.

# 

## 5.1 Permitted Transfers. Each of the Holders hereby agrees that, until it and any permitted transferees under paragraph (e) or (f) hereunder have disposed of all of the Acquired Shares, it will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of SkyTerra, sell, distribute, transfer or otherwise dispose (in each case, a “Disposition”) of any Acquired Shares except:

### 

### (e) sales or transfers of Acquired Shares pursuant to a tender or exchange offer which the Board of Directors of SkyTerra does not oppose within 10 business days after the date of commencement (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2(a) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of such offer; or

### 

### (f) dispositions of Acquired Shares by any Holder to any wholly owned subsidiary of such Holder or to a successor corporation of such Holder; provided, however, that in each such case, the transferee shall receive and hold such Acquired Shares subject to, and the transferee and all of the transferees’ Affiliates shall agree to be bound by, all the terms of this Agreement, which terms shall also inure to the benefit of such transferees, and there shall be no further transfer of such Acquired Shares, except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1; or

### 

### (g) dispositions pursuant to any merger, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization to which SkyTerra is a party or in connection with any reclassification of Acquired Shares.

### 

provided, that in the event that any Seller seeks to effect a Disposition of any Acquired Shares pursuant to clauses (b), (c) or (f) of this Section 5.1, (i) such Disposition is made in compliance with applicable securities laws, and (ii) prior to such Disposition, such Seller shall have delivered to SkyTerra an opinion of counsel stating that such Disposition (A) is permitted by this Agreement and the applicable Merger / Purchase Agreement on Schedule A hereto, (B) does not require registration under the Securities Act, and (C) does not cause the applicable Merger / Purchase Agreement to be required to have been registered under the Securities Act and that this Agreement is enforceable against the transferee of such Acquired Shares.
