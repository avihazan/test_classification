The parties intend that this Agreement be drafted and administered in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code Section 409A”), including, but not limited to, any future amendments to Code Section 409A, and any other Internal Revenue Service or other governmental rulings or interpretations (“IRS Guidance”) issued pursuant to Code Section 409A so as not to subject the Executive to payment of interest or any additional tax under Code Section 409A.

Any amounts eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement during a taxable year may not affect expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year, and any right to reimbursement under this Agreement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
