### 

# 5\. Manner of Exercise. To the extent that the Option (or portion thereof) shall have become and remain vested and exercisable as provided in Section 2 and subject to such reasonable administrative regulations as the Board may have adopted, such Option (or portion thereof) may be exercised, in whole or in part, by notice to the Secretary of the Company in writing given on the date as of which the Grantee will so exercise the Options (the “Exercise Date”), specifying the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised (the “Exercise Shares”), subject to the Grantee becoming a party to the Stockholders Agreement, executing and delivering a Subscription Agreement, and the delivery to the Company by the Grantee, on or within ten business

If shares of Common Stock are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or bid and ask prices for shares of Common Stock are quoted over NASDAQ, the Grantee may, in lieu of cash, tender shares of Common Stock that have been owned by the Grantee for at least six months, having a Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date equal to the aggregate Exercise Price or may deliver a combination of cash and such shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the difference between the aggregate Exercise Price and the amount of such cash as payment of the aggregate Exercise Price, subject to such rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board to provide for the compliance of such payment procedure with applicable law, including Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company may require the Grantee to furnish or execute such other documents as the Company shall reasonably deem necessary (i) to evidence such exercise, (ii) to determine whether registration is then required under the Securities Act and (iii) to comply with or satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act, applicable state or non-U.S. securities laws or any other law.
