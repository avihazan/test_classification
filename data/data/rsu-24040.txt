(Officers and Employees)

THIS NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of this ____ day of _____________, 20__ (the “Grant Date”), by and between Community First, Inc. a Tennessee corporation (together with its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the “Company”), and the individual identified on the signature page hereto (the “Optionee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Community First, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). 

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the Plan, which permits the issuance of stock options for the purchase of shares of the common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (the “Shares”); and

WHEREAS, the Company desires to afford the Optionee an opportunity to purchase Shares as hereinafter provided in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1.Grant of Option.

(a)The Company grants as of the date of this Agreement the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase __________ Shares, in whole or in part (the “Option Stock”), at an exercise price of ___________________________________ and No/100 Dollars ($_________) per Share, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and subject to all provisions of the Plan. The Optionee, holder or beneficiary of the Option shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Option Stock until such person has become a holder of such Shares by the due exercise of the Option and payment of the Option Payment (as defined in Section 3 below) in accordance with this Agreement.

(b)The Option shall be a non-qualified stock option. In order comply with all applicable federal, state or local tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state or other taxes are withheld or collected from the Optionee.

2.Exercise of Option.

(a)Except as otherwise provided herein, this Option shall become vested and exercisable as set forth below, if and only if the Optionee shall have been continuously employed by the Company from the date of this Agreement through and including such dates:

(b)Notwithstanding the above, this Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 100% of the Option Stock in the event of the Optionee’s death or Disability, provided the Optionee has remained continuously employed by the Company from the date of this Agreement to such event.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control, this Option shall become vested and exercisable (but only to the extent such Option has not otherwise terminated) with respect to 100% of the Option Stock immediately prior to the Change in Control.

3.Manner of Exercise. The Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time within the period permitted hereunder for the exercise of the Option, with respect to whole Shares only, by serving written notice of intent to exercise the Option delivered to the Company at its principal office (or to the Company’s designated agent), stating the number of Shares to be purchased, the person or persons in whose name the Shares are to be registered and each such person’s address and social security number. Such notice shall not be effective unless accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is then being exercised (the “Option Payment”) and, except as otherwise provided herein, cash equal to the required withholding taxes as set forth by Internal Revenue Service and applicable state and local tax guidelines for the employer’s minimum statutory withholding (the “Witholding Taxes”). The Option Payment shall be made (a) in cash or cash equivalents, (b) by transfer, either actually or by attestation, to the Company of whole Shares previously acquired by the Optionee and valued at the Shares’ Fair Market Value on the date of exercise (or next succeeding trading date if the date of exercise is not a trading date), or by a combination of such cash (or cash equivalents) and Shares, or (c) by directing the Company to withhold that number of whole Shares otherwise deliverable to the Optionee pursuant to the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the Option Payment and, in the Committee’s discretion, a Fair Market Value equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any Witholding Taxes not otherwise paid in cash or cash equivalents. Subject to applicable securities laws and the consent of the Committee, the Optionee may also exercise the Option by delivering a notice of exercise of the Option and by simultaneously selling the Shares of Option Stock thereby acquired pursuant to a brokerage or similar agreement approved in advance by proper officers of the Company, using the proceeds of such sale as payment of the Option Payment, together with any applicable Withholding Taxes.

4.Termination of Option. The Option will expire ten (10) years from the date of grant of the Option (the “Term”) with respect to any then unexercised portion thereof, unless terminated earlier as set forth below:

(a)Termination by Death. If the Optionee’s employment by the Company terminates by reason of death, this Option may thereafter be exercised, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting provided for in Section 2 above), by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the Optionee under the will of the Optionee, for a period of one (1) year from the date of death or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.

(b)Termination by Reason of Disability. If the Optionee’s employment by the Company terminates by reason of Disability, this Option may thereafter be exercised, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination (after giving effect to any acceleration

of vesting provided for in Section 2 above), by the Optionee or personal representative or guardian of the Optionee, as applicable, for a period of three (3) years from the date of such termination of employment or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.

(c)Termination by Retirement. If the Optionee’s employment by the Company terminates by reason of Retirement, this Option may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination for a period of three (3) years from the date of such termination of employment or until the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.

(d)Termination for Cause. If the Optionee’s employment by the Company is terminated for Cause, this Option shall terminate immediately and become void and of no effect.

(e)Other Termination. If the Optionee’s employment by the Company terminates for any reason other than for Cause, death, Disability or Retirement, this Option may be exercised, to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time of such termination by the Optionee for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination of employment or the expiration of the Term of the Option, whichever period is the shorter.

5.No Right to Continued Employment. The grant of the Option shall not be construed as giving the Optionee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, and the Company may at any time dismiss the Optionee from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan.

6.Adjustment to Option Stock. The Committee may make equitable and proportionate adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, this Option in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (and shall make the adjustments for the events described in Section 4.2 of the Plan) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles in accordance with the Plan, whenever the Committee determines that such event(s) affect the Shares. Any such adjustments shall be effected in a manner that precludes the material enlargement of rights and benefits under this Award.

7.Amendments to Option. Subject to the restrictions contained in the Plan, the Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, the Option, prospectively or retroactively; provided that any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the Optionee or any holder or beneficiary of the Option shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of the Optionee, holder or beneficiary affected.

8.Limited Transferability. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, during the Optionee’s lifetime, this Option can be exercised only by the Optionee, and this Option may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempt to otherwise transfer this Option shall be void. No transfer of this Option by the Optionee by will or by laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Company shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and an authenticated copy of the will and/or such other evidence as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate to establish the validity of the transfer.

The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, and in the case of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern.

11.Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or the Award, or would disqualify the Plan or Award under any laws deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and Award shall remain in full force and effect.
