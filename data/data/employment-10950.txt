Mattsson will be eligible for a discretionary annual bonus from the Company that will be linked to the achievement of annual performance targets identified for him. Annual performance targets will be agreed between Mattsson and his reporting manager at the beginning of each bonus year. The bonus will be calculated as a percentage of Mattsson’s yearly basic salary and will be paid by the Company as a cash bonus and/or as an additional pension payment. Payment of any bonus pursuant to this bonus arrangement shall be made during the month of January the year following the bonus year during which the bonus entitlement ha accrued (the “Payment Date”). 

For the year 2008, Mattsson will receive a maximum bonus corresponding to up to 27% of Mattsson’s yearly basic salary if all annual performance targets are met. 

The Company and Mattsson shall agree on the allocation between cash and pension payments not less than four weeks prior to the Payment Date. The Company will pay pension premiums in accordance with the ITP 1-pension plan based on all cash bonus payments (the “ITP 1 Pension Payments”). Any bonus amounts agreed between the Company and Mattsson to be paid as an additional pension payment (not being an ITP 1 Pension Payment) shall be paid as a one-time pension premium under a pension insurance specified by Mattsson. 

Any bonus payment under this bonus arrangement is conditional upon (i) Mattsson continuing to be employed by the Company on the Payment Date, and that neither the Company or Mattsson has given notice of termination of employment on or prior to the Payment Date, and (ii) that Mattsson’s performance the year during which bonus entitlement ha accrued has been to the satisfaction of the Company.
