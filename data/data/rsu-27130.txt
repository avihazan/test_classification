This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the “Agreement”), is made and entered into as of _______ (the “Date of Grant”), by and between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and _____________________, an employee of the Company (the “Grantee”). This Agreement is pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The applicable terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, including the definition of capitalized terms contained in the Plan.

  


Section 1. Restricted Stock Award. The Company hereby grants to the Grantee, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, an Award with respect to ___________ shares of the Company’s common stock under the Plan (the “Restricted Shares”).

Section 2. Rights of Grantee. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Grantee shall be entitled, at all times on and after the Date of Grant, to exercise all rights of a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Shares (whether or not the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed), including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and the right to receive cash dividends thereon (subject to applicable tax withholding). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the expiration of the Period of Restriction, the Grantee shall not be entitled to transfer, sell, pledge, alienate, hypothecate or assign the Restricted Shares. All rights with respect to the Restricted Shares shall be available only to the Grantee during his lifetime, and thereafter to the Grantee’s estate.

  


Section 3. Vesting and Lapse of Restrictions. Subject to the forfeiture provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof, any restrictions on the Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall vest on _______ (the period from the Date of Grant until _______, the “Period of Restriction”). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, but subject to Section 7 hereof, any restrictions on the Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall vest upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in Appendix A hereto) or upon the death of Grantee.

  


Section 4. Escrow and Delivery of Shares. Certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall be issued and held by the Company in escrow and shall remain in the custody of the Company until their delivery to the Grantee or his or her estate as set forth in Section 6 hereof, subject to the Grantee’s delivery of any documents which the Company in its discretion may require as a condition to the issuance of shares and the delivery of shares to the Grantee or his estate. While the certificates representing the Restricted Shares are held by the Company, and if so requested by the Company, the Grantee will provide to the Company assignments separate from such certificates, in blank, signed by the Grantee to be held by the Company during the Period of Restriction. Certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall be delivered to the Grantee as soon as practicable following the expiration of the Period of Restriction, provided that the Grantee has satisfied any applicable Withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 8 hereof. Any Shares evidenced by the certificates delivered to the Grantee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be free of any contractual restrictions on transferability after the last day of the Period of Restriction, subject to compliance with all federal and state securities laws.

* * *

Section 5. Stock Certificate Legend. Each stock certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: “This Certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture, restrictions against transfer and rights of repurchase, if applicable) contained in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the registered owner of the shares represented hereby and the Company. Release from such terms and conditions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, a copy of which is on file in the office of the Company’s Secretary.” As soon as practicable following the expiration of the Period of Restriction, the Company shall issue new certificates that shall not bear the foregoing legend, which certificates shall be delivered in accordance with Section 4 hereof.

  


Section 6. Effect of Termination of Service. If the Grantee’s service as an Employee is terminated prior to the end of the Period of Restriction, the Grantee shall forfeit the Restricted Shares, which shall be returned to the treasury of the Company; provided that (i) in the event such termination of service is a result of Grantee’s Retirement or Disability then the Restricted Shares shall not be forfeited and shall, subject to the forfeiture provisions of Section 7 hereof, continue to vest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) in the event such termination of service is a result of Grantee’s death then any applicable restrictions upon unvested Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Company shall deliver to the Grantee or his estate certificates in respect of the Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

  


Section 7. Forfeiture Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of service for “cause” (as defined below), the breach of any non-competition or confidentiality restrictions applicable to the Grantee, or the Grantee’s participation in an activity that is deemed by the Company to be detrimental to the Company (including, without limitation, criminal activity or accepting employment with a competitor of the Company), (i) the Grantee’s right to receive an issuance of Restricted Stock shall immediately terminate, and, (ii) any unvested Restricted Shares held by the Grantee shall be forfeited, and (iii) if the Restricted Shares have been issued upon the expiration of the Period of Restriction, in whole or in part, then either (A) the Shares so issued shall be forfeited and returned to the Company, or (B) the Grantee will be required to pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares as of the expiration of the Period of Restriction.

  


For purposes hereof, “cause” shall have the meaning specified in such Grantee’s employment agreement with the Company, or, in the case of a Grantee who is not employed pursuant to an employment agreement, “cause” shall mean any of the following acts by the Grantee: (i) embezzlement or misappropriation of corporate funds, (ii) any acts resulting in a conviction for, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a charge of commission of a felony, (iii) misconduct resulting in injury to the Company or any subsidiary, (iv) activities harmful to the reputation of the Company or any subsidiary, (v) a violation of Company or subsidiary operating guidelines or policies, (vi) willful refusal to perform, or substantial disregard of, the duties properly assigned to the Grantee, or (vi) a violation of any contractual, statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any subsidiary.

Section 8. Withholding of Taxes. The Grantee may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) with respect to the grant of Restricted Shares by promptly filing a copy of such election with the Company. If the Grantee makes such an election, the grant of Restricted Shares shall be conditioned upon the prompt payment by the Grantee to the Company of an amount equal to the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts required by law to be withheld (the “Withholding Taxes”) in connection with such election. If the Grantee does not make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the grant of Restricted Shares, the Grantee shall pay to the Company any required Withholding Taxes upon the lapse of all restrictions and expiration of the Period of Restriction, and the delivery of the Restricted Shares and any unpaid dividends thereon pursuant to Section 4 shall be conditioned upon the prior payment of the applicable Withholding Taxes by the Grantee.

  


Section 9. Securities Law Compliance. No Restricted Shares shall be delivered upon the lapse of any restrictions applicable thereto unless and until the Company and/or the Grantee shall have complied with all applicable federal or state registration, listing and/or qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it that a prospective Grantee may acquire such shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the applicable securities laws. Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company reserves the right to legend any certificate for Restricted Shares, conditioning sales of such Shares upon compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations.

  


Section 10. No Rights as Employee or Consultant. Nothing in this Agreement or the Award shall confer upon the Grantee any right to continue as an Employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate the Grantee’s service at any time.

  


Section 11. Adjustments.
