5.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.

  


5.1

Executive acknowledges that (i) he has a major responsibility for the operation, administration, development and growth of the Company's business, (ii) his work for the Company has brought him and will continue to bring him into close contact with confidential information of the Company and its customers, and (iii) the agreements and covenants contained in this Paragraph 5 are essential to protect the business interest of the Company and that the Company will not enter into this Agreement but for such agreements and covenants. Accordingly, the Executive covenants and agrees as follows (the provisions of Section 5.1(a) and 5.1(b) are referred to collectively, as the “Restrictive Covenants”):

  


5.1(a)

During the Term of this Agreement, the Termination Period, if applicable, and thereafter, the Executive shall not other than in the performance of his duties disclose to anyone any information about the affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, trade secrets, trade "know-how", inventions, customer lists, business plans, operational methods, pricing policies, marketing plans, sales plans, identity of suppliers or customers, sales, profits or other financial information, which is confidential to the Company or is not generally known in the relevant trade, nor shall the Executive make use of any such information for his own benefit. Any technique, method, process or technology used by the Company shall be considered a "trade secret" for the purposes of this Agreement.

  


5.1(b)

Executive hereby agrees that all know-how, documents, reports, plans, proposals, marketing and sales plans, client lists, client files and materials made by him or by the Company are the property of the Company and shall not be used by him in any way adverse to the Company's interests. Executive shall not deliver, reproduce or in any way allow such documents or things to be delivered or used by any third party without specific direction or consent of the Board of Directors of the Company. Executive hereby assigns to the Company any rights which he may have in any such trade secret or proprietary information. 

  


5.2

If any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants, which shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, the parties hereto agree that the court making such termination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.

  


5.3

The parties hereto intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants. In the event that the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions shall hold such Restrictive Covenants wholly unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such determination not bar or in any way affect the Company's right to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdictions within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants, as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, the above covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.

  


6.

TERMINATION.

  


6.1

The Company may terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement at any time for Cause (as defined below). "Cause" shall exist for such termination if Executive (i) is adjudicated guilty of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) commits any act of fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with his employment by the Company, (iii) has, in the reasonable judgment of, and after a good faith investigation by, the Company, (a) engaged in serious and willful misconduct, which conduct has, or would if generally known, materially adversely affect the goodwill or reputation of the Company and which conduct the Executive has not cured or altered to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors within ten (10) days following written notice by the Company to the Executive regarding such conduct, or (b) willfully and intentionally failed to perform his duties as specified to him by the Board of Directors, which failure the Executive has not cured or rectified to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors within ten (10) days following written notice by the Company, or (iv) has made any material misrepresentation to the Company under Paragraphs 4 and 5 hereof.

6.3

If Executive’s employment is terminated for any reason (whether by Executive or the Company) within thirty (30) days following a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 6.5 below. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Change in Control of the Company” shall mean, at such time as the Company’s Board of Directors becomes fully constituted (e.g., the number of directors reaches five (5)), a cumulative change in the identity of a majority of the members of the Company’s first fully constituted Board of Directors (provided, however, that the appointment of a new director upon the death or resignation of a director by the remaining directors then in office shall not constitute a change in identity with respect to such departed director).

  


6.5

Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company "without cause" (for any reason or no reason at all) at any time by giving Executive sixty (60) days prior written notice of termination, which termination shall be effective on the 60th day following such notice. If Executive's employment under this Agreement is so terminated, the Company shall make a lump sum cash payment to Executive on the date of termination of an amount equal to the remaining Base Salary payable through the remaining term. (i) a pro rata portion of any Incentive Compensation, if any, earned for the year in which termination occurs prorated to the date of termination, plus (ii) any unreimbursed expenses accruing to the date of termination. The Company shall also continue Executive’s benefits through the remainder of the Term.

  


6.6

Executive may terminate Executive’s employment hereunder by giving the Company ten (10) days’ prior written notice, which termination shall be effective on the 60th day following such notice. Voluntary termination shall not entitle the Executive to receive any compensation following the date of termination. 

  


6.7

At the Company's option, Executive shall immediately leave the Company's premises on the date notice of termination is given by either Executive or the Company. If the Company requests Executive to leave the Company following notice under Paragraph 6.6, it shall fully compensate Executive (salary and benefits) through the 10th day following the date of Executive’s notice.

  


7.

MISCELLANEOUS.

  


7.1

The Company may, from time to time, apply for and take out, in its own name and at its own expense, life, health, accident, disability or other insurance upon the Executive in any sum or sums that it may deem necessary to protect its interests, and the Executive agrees to aid and cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Company in procuring any and all such insurance, including without limitation, submitting to the usual and customary medical examinations, and by filling out, executing and delivering such applications and other instruments in writing as may be reasonably required by an insurance company or companies to which an application or applications for such insurance may be made by or for the Company. In order to induce the Company to enter this Agreement, the Executive represents and warrants to the Company that to the best of his knowledge the Executive is insurable at standard (non-rated) premiums.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Executive shall not have any power of anticipation, alienation or assignment of payments contemplated hereunder, and all rights and benefits of the Executive shall be for the sole personal benefit of the Executive, and no other person shall acquire any right, title or interest hereunder by reason of any sale, assignment, transfer, claim or judgment or bankruptcy proceedings against the Executive; provided, however, that in the event of the Executive's death, the Executive's estate, legal representative or beneficiaries (as the case may be) shall have the right to receive all of the benefit that accrued to the Executive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement.

  


7.3

The Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement to any successor of substantially all of its business or assets, and any such successor shall be bound by all of the provisions hereof.
