APPENDIX A 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES 

1\. Grant. The Company hereby grants to the Employee under the Plan an award of the Target Number of Performance Shares set forth on the Notice of Grant, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. The Performance Shares in which the Employee may vest shall depend upon achievement of [INSERT DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE GOALS] for the Performance Period and shall be determined in accordance with the Performance Matrix, attached hereto as Appendix B. In accordance with the Performance Matrix, the number of the Performance Shares in which the Employee may vest will range [INSERT APPLICABLE RANGE]. The number of such Shares shall be determined by the Committee following the end of the Performance Period, and shall be certified by the Committee following the end of each Performance Period. When Shares are paid to the Employee in payment for the Performance Shares, par value will be deemed paid by the Employee for each Performance Share by past services rendered by the Employee, and will be subject to the appropriate tax withholdings. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

(a) As used herein, [INSERT APPLICABLE DEFINITIONS]. 

2\. Company’s Obligation to Pay. Each Performance Share has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date that the Performance Share is granted. Unless and until the Performance Shares have vested in the manner set forth in paragraphs 3 through 5, the Employee will have no right to payment of such Performance Shares. Prior to actual payment of any vested Performance Shares, such Performance Shares will represent an unsecured obligation. Payment of any vested Performance Shares shall be made in whole Shares only. 

3\. Vesting Schedule/Period of Restriction. Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, and subject to paragraph 7, the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement shall vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth on the first page of this Agreement. Performance Shares shall not vest in the Employee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement unless the Employee shall have been continuously employed by the Company or by one of its Subsidiaries from the Grant Date until the date the Performance Shares are otherwise scheduled to vest. 

4\. Modifications to Vesting Schedule. 

(a) Vesting upon Leave of Absence. In the event that the Employee takes an authorized leave of absence (“LOA”), the Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are scheduled to vest shall be modified as follows: 

(i) if the duration of the Employee’s LOA is sixty (60) days or less, the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement shall not be affected by the Employee’s LOA. 

-3- 

* * *

(ii) if the duration of the Employee’s LOA is greater than sixty (60) days, the scheduled vesting of any Performance Shares awarded by this Agreement that are not then vested shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the Employee’s LOA. 

(b) Death or Disability of Employee. In the event that the Employee incurs a Termination of Service due to his or her death or Disability during a Performance Period, the Employee shall immediately vest [INSERT DESCRIPTION OF VESTING CONDITIONS] 

In the event that any applicable law limits the Company’s ability to accelerate the vesting of this award of Performance Shares, this paragraph 4(b) shall be limited to the extent required to comply with applicable law. 

(c) Change in Control.

(i) In the event of a Change in Control, this award shall be subject to the definitive agreement governing such Change in Control. Such agreement, without the Employee’s consent and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan, must provide for one of the following: (a) the assumption of this award by the surviving corporation or its parent; (b) the substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of an award with substantially the same terms as this award; or (c) the cancellation of this award after full vesting and payment to the Employee of the Shares then subject to the award; provided, however, that such Shares shall be considered delivered effective as of immediately prior to the Change in Control so as to enable the Employee to participate in the Change in Control transaction. In the event the definitive agreement does not provide for one of the foregoing alternatives with respect to the treatment of this award, this award shall have the treatment specified in clause (c) of the preceding sentence. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of this award in connection with a Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the 1934 Act) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then outstanding voting securities; (b) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; (c) a change in the composition of the Board occurring within a one-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors; or (d) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding 

-4- 

* * *

immediately after such merger or consolidation. “Incumbent Directors” means directors who either (A) are Directors as of the effective date of the Plan, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the Directors at the time of such election or nomination (but will not include an individual whose election or nomination is in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors to the Company). 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the Employee incurs a Termination of Service within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control on account of a termination by the Company (or any Subsidiary) for any reason other than Misconduct, then this award immediately will vest in one hundred percent (100%) of the Performance Shares subject to this Performance Share award. 

For purposes of this Agreement, “Misconduct” means (a) the commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty by the Employee, (b) the Employee’s conviction of, or plea of nolo contendre to, a felony, (c) any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Employee of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or (d) any other intentional misconduct by the Employee adversely affecting the business or affairs of the Company or of any Subsidiary in a material manner. The preceding definition shall not be deemed to be inclusive of all the acts or omissions that the Company (or any Subsidiary) may consider as grounds for the dismissal or discharge of the Employee or any other individual in the service of the Company (or any Subsidiary). 

(iii) In the event of a Change in Control during any Performance Period, all Performance Periods shall be deemed to end immediately prior to the Change in Control and the number of Performance Shares in which the Employee shall be entitled to vest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Vesting Schedule set forth on the Notice of Grant shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the Target Number of Performance Shares (as set forth on the Notice of Grant) less the number of vested Performance Shares. 

5\. Committee Discretion. If the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that a “Triggering Event” has occurred, then the Committee, also in its sole discretion, may reduce (including to zero) the number of Performance Shares that vest under the Agreement at any time prior to any Vesting Date that occurs after the date of the Triggering Event. For purposes of this Agreement, “Triggering Event” means (a) the Company being required to restate any financial statement issued since the Grant Date with the result that the Company’s reported results are materially, negatively reduced, (b) any act of fraud taken by the Employee in connection with the Employee’s responsibilities as an employee that is intended to result in the Employee’s substantial personal enrichment, (c) the Employee’s material violation of a federal, state or local law or regulation applicable to the Company’s business that has a significant negative effect on the Company’s reputation or business, (d) a material breach of the Employee’s fiduciary duty owed to the Company that has a significant negative effect on the Company’s reputation or business, or (e) the average Fair Market Value of a Share during the last thirty (30) days of a Performance Period is at least forty percent (40%) higher than the average Fair Market Value of a Share during the immediately the preceding ninety (90) days of the same Performance Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the first sentence of this paragraph 4, in the case of Triggering Event that occurs solely on account of clause (e) of the preceding sentence, the Committee may not reduce the 

-5- 

* * *

number of Performance Shares that vest for a Performance Period below the Target Number of Performance Shares for that Performance Period. In exercising its discretion, the Committee may consider (but not by way of limitation) whether the foregoing increase in the Fair Market Value of a Share was due to factors unrelated to Company and/or management performance, including, but not limited to, takeover speculation. 

6\. Payment after Vesting. Any Performance Shares that vest in accordance with paragraphs 3 through 4 will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in Shares as soon as practicable following the date of vesting, subject to paragraph 9, but in no event later than the applicable two and one-half (2 1/2) month period of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth in the Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Performance Shares are “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A, the vested Performance Shares will be released to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in Shares as soon as practicable following the date of vesting, subject to paragraph 9, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year that includes the date of vesting or, if later, the fifteen (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following the date of vesting (provided that the Employee will not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year of the payment). Further, if some or all of the Performance Shares that are “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A vest on account of the Employee’s Termination of Service (other than due to death) in accordance with paragraphs 3 through 4, the Performance Shares that vest on account of the Employee’s Termination of Service will not be considered due or payable until the Employee has a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. In addition, if the Employee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of the Employee’s separation from service (other than due to death), then any accelerated Performance Shares will be paid to the Employee no earlier than six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Employee’s separation from service unless the Employee dies following his or her separation from service, in which case, the Performance Shares will be paid to the Employee’s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death, subject to paragraph 9. Any Performance Shares that vest in accordance with paragraph 5 will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee’s death, to his or her estate) in Shares in accordance with the provisions of such paragraph, subject to paragraph 9. For each Performance Share that vests, the Employee will receive one Share. For purposes of this Agreement, “Section 409A” means Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any final Treasury Regulations and other Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time (“Section 409A”). 

7\. Forfeiture. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, (a) the balance of the Performance Shares that have not vested pursuant to paragraphs 3 through 5 at the time of the Employee’s Termination of Service for any or no reason will be forfeited immediately and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company, and (b) any Performance Shares that never will vest due to non-satisfaction of the goals contained in the Performance Matrix will be forfeited on the date on which the goals no longer can be satisfied and the Performance Shares automatically will be transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company. In addition, any Performance Shares that have not vested [INSERT DESCRIPTION OF VESTING SCHEDULE] shall be forfeited and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company.

* * *

8\. Death of Employee. Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Employee’s estate. Any such administrator or executor must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. 

9\. Withholding of Taxes. When Shares are issued as payment for vested Performance Shares, the Company (or the employing Subsidiary) will withhold a portion of the Shares that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay federal, state, local and foreign income, social insurance, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or the employing Subsidiary with respect to the Shares, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, either requires or otherwise permits the Employee to make alternate arrangements satisfactory to the Company for such withholdings in advance of the arising of any withholding obligations. The number of Shares withheld pursuant to the prior sentence will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, with no refund for any value of the Shares withheld in excess of the tax obligation as a result of such rounding. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no Shares will be issued unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Company) have been made by the Employee with respect to the payment of any income and other taxes which the Company determines must be withheld or collected with respect to such Shares. In addition and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company (or the employing Subsidiary) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to the Employee, cash having a sufficient value to satisfy any tax withholding obligations that the Company determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of otherwise deliverable Shares. All income and other taxes related to the Performance Shares award and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the sole responsibility of the Employee. By accepting this award, the Employee expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and to any additional cash withholding as provided for in this paragraph 9. 

10\. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 

11\. No Effect on Employment. Subject to any employment contract with the Employee, the terms of such employment will be determined from time to time by the Company, or the Subsidiary employing the Employee, as the case may be, and the Company, or the Subsidiary employing the Employee, as the case may be, will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment for any period of time. A leave of absence or an interruption in service (including an interruption during military service) authorized or acknowledged by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Employee, as the case may be, shall not be deemed a Termination of Service for the purposes of this Agreement.

14\. Restrictions on Sale of Securities. The Shares issued as payment for vested Performance Shares under this Agreement will be registered under U.S. federal securities laws and will be freely tradable upon receipt.

The Employee expressly warrants that he or she is not accepting this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein.
