8. Indemnification. The Corporation agrees that if the Executive is made a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether or not the basis of such Proceeding is the Executive’s alleged action in an official capacity while serving as a director, officer, member, employee or agent, the Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent legally permitted or authorized by the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or resolutions of the Corporation’s Board of Directors or, if greater, by the laws of the State of New York, against all cost, expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by the Executive in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to the Executive’s heirs, executors and administrators.

9\. Benefits Upon Termination. The Corporation will provide the following benefits upon the termination of the Executive’s employment with the Corporation. 

(a) Upon Termination By The Corporation Other Than For Cause Or By The Executive With Good Reason.

(i) Salary and Medical Benefits. The Executive will receive his full salary and fringe benefits through the effective date of termination together with any unpaid incentive for a prior period that is then due and owing to the Executive.

Such amount shall be paid in 26 consecutive bi-weekly installments in accordance with the Corporation’s payroll period. For purposes of this paragraph 9, the term “annual total compensation” shall mean only the base cash compensation paid to the Executive only in his capacity as President and Chief Executive Officer in bi-weekly amounts plus any cash incentive compensation actually paid to the Executive during such three year period. Such term shall not include any other form of compensation or benefit paid or provided to the Executive. During the Post-Termination Period, the Executive shall continue to receive medical and dental benefits pursuant to such plans as are in effect on the date of termination of employment.

(ii) Accrued Vacation. The Executive will receive payment for accrued but unused vacation, which payment will be equitably prorated based on the period of active employment for that portion of the fiscal year in which the Executive’s termination of employment becomes effective. Payment for accrued but unused vacation will be payable in one lump sum in the next payroll period following the date of termination of employment. 

(b) Upon Termination By The Executive Absent Good Reason Or By The Corporation For Cause. Upon the Executive’s termination of employment absent Good Reason or by the Corporation for Cause, the Corporation will provide the following: 

(i) Salary. The Executive will receive only his bi-weekly salary and fringe benefits through the effective date of termination together with any unpaid incentive for a prior period that is then due and owing to the Executive. 

(ii) Accrued Vacation.

(c) Upon Termination For Death or Disability. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment because of Disability, the Corporation will provide the amounts provided for in paragraph 9(a) above. 

(d) Upon Termination Following A Change In Control. Upon the Executive’s termination of employment by the Corporation without cause or the Employee’s termination with good reason which, in either case, occurs in contemplation of or following a change in control, the Corporation will provide the Executive compensation and benefits under any change in control agreement entered into with the Executive. 

(e) Determination Of Disability. Any question as to the existence of a physical or mental condition which would give rise to the Disability of the Executive upon which the Executive and the Corporation cannot agree will be determined by a qualified independent physician selected by the Executive and reasonably acceptable to the Corporation (or, if the Executive is unable to make a selection, the selection of the physician will be made by any adult member of his immediate family). The physician’s written determination to the Corporation and to the Executive will be final and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement. 

(f) Continuation of Healthcare Coverage. For purposes of COBRA continuation healthcare coverage, the “qualifying event” will be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of termination of the Executive’s employment.

Corporation not generally available to the public (the “Confidential Information”). The parties hereby acknowledge that any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the Confidential Information could cause irreparable damage to the Corporation. The parties also agree that covenants by the Executive not to make unauthorized use or disclosures of the Confidential Information are essential to the growth and stability of the business of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Executive agrees to the confidentiality covenants set forth in this Section. 

The Executive agrees that, except as required by his duties with the Corporation or as authorized by the Corporation in writing, he will not use or disclose to anyone at any time, regardless of whether before or after the Executive ceases to be employed by the Corporation, any of the Confidential Information obtained by him in the course of his employment with the Corporation. The Executive shall not be deemed to have violated this Section 10 by disclosure of Confidential Information that at the time of disclosure (a) is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the Executive, or (b) is disclosed as required by court order or as otherwise required by law, on the condition that notice of the requirement for such disclosure is given to the Corporation prior to make any disclosure. 

The Executive agrees that since irreparable damage could result from his breach of the covenants in this Section, in addition to any and all other remedies available to the Corporation, the Corporation will have the remedies of a restraining order, injunction or other equitable relief to enforce the provisions thereof. The Executive consents to jurisdiction in Erie County, New York on the date of the commencement of any action for purposes of any claims under this Section. In addition, the Executive agrees that the issues in any action brought under this Section will be limited to claims under this Section, and all other claims or counterclaims under other provisions of this Agreement will be excluded. 

The Executive hereby sells, assigns and transfers to the Corporation all of his right, title and interest in and to all inventions, discoveries, improvements and copyrightable subject matter (the “rights”) which during the term of the Executive’s employment are made or conceived by him, alone or with others and which are within or arise out of any general field of the Corporation’s business or arise out of any work he performs or information he receives regarding the business of the Corporation while employed by the Corporation.
