If Employee should cease his employment hereunder voluntarily for any reason, or is terminated for just cause, all compensation and benefits payable to Employee shall thereupon, without any further writing or act, cease, lapse and be terminated.

Re: 

Confidentiality Agreement  
  
  


Gentlemen:

  


In connection with the execution of an employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) between the undersigned and Friendlyway Corp. (together with affiliates, the “Company”), the Company will furnish to the undersigned certain information concerning its business, financial position, operations, business contacts, assets and liabilities. As a condition to such information’s being furnished to the undersigned and as a condition to the undersigned’s entering into an employment agreement with the Company, the undersigned agrees to treat any information concerning the Company (whether prepared by the Company, its advisors, or otherwise, and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished to the undersigned now or in the future by or on behalf of the Company (together with the material described below, herein collectively referred to as the “Confidential Material”) in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions hereinafter set forth.

  


The undersigned understands that the term “Confidential Material” also includes all notes, analysis, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Company or its representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to the undersigned. The term “Confidential Material” does not include information which (A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the undersigned, or (B) was lawfully within the undersigned’s possession prior to its being furnished to the undersigned by or on behalf of the Company, provided that the source of such information was not known by the undersigned to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information, or (C) is disclosed to the undersigned by a third party, provided that such third party was not known by the undersigned to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information.

  


The undersigned hereby agrees that he will use the Confidential Material solely in connection with the undersigned’s performance of his duties under the employment agreement, that the Confidential Material will be kept confidential and that the undersigned will not disclose any of the Confidential Material in any manner whatsoever. 

  


The undersigned hereby agrees that he shall not reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to recreate or duplicate any model or working model capable of performing the functions of any portion or all of the Company’s Wireless Internet access system included in the Confidential Material.

  


In the event that the undersigned is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Material, the undersigned will provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this letter agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Company, the undersigned is, nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Material, the undersigned may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Confidential Material specifically required by an order of Court. Additionally, the undersigned shall make every reasonable effort and take every reasonable action, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Company, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Material.

  


* * *

Upon termination of the Employment Agreement or at any time upon the request of the Company, the undersigned will promptly deliver to the Company or certify destruction of, at the Company’s direction, all Confidential Material (and all copies thereof) furnished to the undersigned by or on behalf of the Company pursuant hereto. All oral Confidential Material provided to the undersigned shall continue to be held confidential hereunder. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Material, the undersigned will continue to be bound by obligations of confidentiality hereunder.

  


The undersigned agrees that the Company, without prejudice to any rights to judicial relief he may otherwise have, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this letter agreement and that the undersigned will not oppose the granting of such relief. The undersigned also agrees that he will not seek and agrees to waive any requirement for the securing and posting of a bond in connection with the Company’s seeking or obtaining such relief. In the event of litigation relating to this letter agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the undersigned has breached this letter agreement, then the undersigned will be liable to pay to the Company the reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom. Also, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the undersigned has not breached this letter agreement, then the Company will be liable to pay to the undersigned the reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.

  


This letter agreement is for the benefit of the Company, and shall be construed (both as to validity and performance) and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Colorado applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction. This letter agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the earlier of the date that is three years from the termination of the undersigned’s employment by the Company or the date that this agreement is terminated by the Company.

  


Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning one copy of this letter to the undersigned whereupon this letter agreement shall become a binding agreement.

  


Very truly yours,

Exhibit “B”

  


Agreement Not to Compete

  


* * *

  


AGREEMENT NOT TO COMPETE

  


THIS AGREEMENT NOT TO COMPETE is entered into by and between Friendlyway Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Employer”), and Adam Self (“Employee”).

  


WHEREAS, Employee is employed by Employer as Chief Information Officer, pursuant to an employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”); and

  


WHEREAS, as a condition to such employment, Employee has agreed to sign and be bound by this Agreement Not to Compete; and

  


NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

  


Section 1\. Covenant Not to Compete. Employee acknowledges that, as a key management employee of Employer, Employee will be involved, on a high level, in the development, implementation and management of the national and international business strategies and plans of Employer, which shall consist of Employer and such other business units, divisions, subsidiaries or other entities of Employer as Employer shall determine in its sole discretion from time to time. By virtue of Employee’s unique and sensitive position and special background, employment of Employee by a competitor of Employer represents a serious competitive danger to Employer, and the use of Employee’s talent and knowledge and information about Employer’s business, strategies and plans can and would constitute a valuable competitive advantage over Employer. In view of the foregoing, Employee covenants and agrees that, if (i) Employee’s employment with Employer is terminated for just cause or (ii) if Employee voluntarily resigns from his employment with Employer, then, for a period of one year after the date of such termination, Employee will not engage or be engaged as, in any capacity, directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, employee, agent, consultant, manager, executive, owner or stockholder (except as a passive investor holding less than 5% equity interest in any enterprise the securities of which are publicly traded) in any business entity engaged in competition with any business conducted by Employer on the date of termination. Employee further agrees that, if his employment shall cease pursuant to the change-in-control provision of the Employment Agreement, then, for so long thereafter as Employee shall receive compensation under the Employment Agreement, Employee shall not engage in the activities prohibited by the preceding sentence. This Agreement Not to Compete shall survive the termination or expiration of the Employment Agreement. If any court determines that this Agreement Not to Compete, or any part hereof, is unenforceable because the duration or geographic scope of such provision, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.

  


For purposes of this Agreement, “just cause” shall have the same meaning as set forth in Section VII (B) of the Employment Agreement of even date between the parties.

  


Section 2\. Continuing Obligations. Employee agrees that, for one year following (i) his termination of employment with Employer for just cause or (ii) his resignation as an employee of Employer, Employee shall keep Employer informed of the identification of Employee’s employer and the nature of such employment or of Employee’s self-employment. Employer agrees that, within fifteen days after receiving notice pursuant to this Section 2 of the identification of the prospective employer, the nature of the employment or self-employment or any change therein, Employer will advise Employee as to whether such employment constitutes a violation of Section 1 hereof. Section 3. Injunctive Relief. Employee acknowledges that the violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement would be detrimental and cause irreparable injury to Employer and its affiliates which could not be compensated by money damages. Employee agrees that an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction is the appropriate remedy for these provisions, and consents to the entry of an appropriate judgment enjoining Employee from violating these provisions in the event there is a find of their breach.

  


Section 4\. Severability of Covenants. Each of the covenants contained in this Agreement are independent covenants, which may be available to or relied upon by Employer and its affiliates in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any one of the separate and independent covenants shall be deemed to be unenforceable under the laws of any state of competent jurisdiction, each of the remaining covenants shall not be affected thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, it is understood that every benefit received by Employee by virtue of this Agreement is consideration for each separate covenant contained herein.

  


* * *

Section 5\. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado.

  


Section 6\. Other Remedies. The undertakings herein shall not be construed as any limitation upon the remedies

Employer might, in the absence of this Agreement, have at law or in equity.

  


INTENDING to be legally bound hereby, Employer and Employee hereby duly execute this Agreement Not to Compete as of the date indicated below.
