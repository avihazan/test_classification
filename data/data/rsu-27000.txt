Natrol, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with all successors thereto, the “Company”), hereby grants to BDL Investment Trust (the “Optionee”), for the benefit of Wayne Bos (the “Executive”), an option (the “Stock Option”) to purchase on or prior to the expiration date specified above, or such earlier date as is specified herein, all or any part of the number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Company indicated above (the “Option Shares”), at the per share option exercise price specified above (which is the fair market value of a share of Common Stock at the time of grant, based upon the last trade immediately prior to the grant) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the “Agreement”). This Stock Option is not intended to qualify as an “incentive stock option” as defined in Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the “Code”).

# 1. Vesting, Exercisability and Sale.

## (a) This Stock Option is fully vested upon its grant on the date hereof.

## 

## (b) This Stock Option shall become exercisable upon approval of this Stock Option by the Company’s shareholders and shall continue to be exercisable by the Optionee or its successors as contemplated herein at any time or times prior to February 14, 2011, subject to the provisions hereof, including, without limitation, Section 5 hereof which provides for the termination of unexercised options upon completion of certain transactions as described therein and the provisions of Section 1(c) below regarding shareholder approval (the earliest to occur of such dates being referred to as the “Expiration Date”).

* * *

  


## (c) In the event the shareholders of the Company do not approve the grant of this Stock Option at the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders held after the date hereof, this Stock Option shall be deemed to be null and void and of no effect.

## 

## (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company during the one year period after the date hereof, this Stock Option shall terminate on the date which is 90 days following the date of such termination of employment.

## 

## (e) The Option Shares may only be sold as set forth on Exhibit A.

## 

# 2. Exercise of Stock Option.

## (a) The Optionee may exercise this Stock Option in the following manner: Prior to the Expiration Date (subject to Section 5), the Optionee may deliver a Stock Option Exercise Notice (an “Exercise Notice”) in the form of Appendix A hereto indicating its election to purchase some or all of the Option Shares. Such notice shall specify the number of Option Shares to be purchased.

## 

Payment of the purchase price for the Option Shares may be made by one or more of the following methods: (i) in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Board of Directors; or (ii) (A) through the delivery (or attestation to ownership) of shares of Common Stock that have been purchased by the Optionee on the open market or that have been held by the Optionee for at least six months and are not subject to restrictions under any plan of the Company, or (B) by the Optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed Exercise Notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company to pay the option purchase price, provided that in the event the Optionee chooses to pay the option purchase price as so provided, the Optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Committee shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure, or (C) a combination of (i), (ii)(A) and (ii)(B) above. Payment instruments will be received subject to collection.

## (b) Certificates for the Option Shares so purchased will be issued and delivered to the Optionee upon compliance to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors with all requirements under applicable laws or regulations in connection with such issuance. Until the Optionee shall have complied with the requirements hereof, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue the Option Shares subject to this Stock Option, and the determination of the Board of Directors as to such compliance shall be final and binding on the Optionee. The Optionee shall not be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of stock subject to this Stock Option unless and until this Stock Option shall have been exercised pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall have issued and delivered the Option Shares to the Optionee, and the Optionee’s name shall have been entered as a stockholder of record on the books of the Company. Thereupon, the Optionee shall have full dividend and other ownership rights with respect to such Option Shares, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

## (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no portion of this Stock Option shall be exercisable after the Expiration Date, including such date as is contemplated by Section 5 hereof.

## 

3. Transferability. This Agreement is personal to the Optionee and is not transferable by the Optionee in any manner. This Stock Option may be exercised only by the Optionee. This Stock Option may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by Optionee. This Stock Option shall not be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or levy of any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be null and void.

4. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization. The shares of stock covered by this Stock Option are shares of Common Stock of the Company. Subject to Section 5 hereof, if the shares of Common Stock as a whole are increased, decreased, changed or converted into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities of the Company or any successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof), whether through merger or consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or the like, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of shares and in the per share exercise price of shares subject to any unexercised portion of this Stock Option. In the event of any such adjustment in this Stock Option, the Optionee thereafter shall have the right, subject to Section 5, to purchase the number of shares under this Stock Option at the per share price, as so adjusted, which the Optionee could purchase at the total purchase price applicable to this Stock Option immediately prior to such adjustment, all references herein to Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to the security that is subject to acquisition upon exercise of this Stock Option and all references to the Company shall be deemed to refer to the issuer of such security. Adjustments under this Section 4 shall be determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination as to what adjustment shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be conclusive. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued here resulting from any such adjustment, but the Company in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.

5. Effect of Certain Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in Section 4 to the contrary, in the case of (a) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (b) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an another person or entity, (c) a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the holders of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity immediately upon completion of such transaction, (d) the sale of all of the outstanding stock of the Company to an unrelated person or entity or (e) any other transaction where the owners of the Company’s outstanding voting power prior to such transaction do not own at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the relevant entity after the transaction (in each case, a “Sale Event”), this Stock Option shall terminate on the effective date of such transaction or event, unless provision is made in such transaction in the sole discretion of the parties thereto for the assumption or continuation by the Company of this Stock Option or the substitution for this Stock Option of a new stock option of the successor person or entity or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and the per share exercise price, as provided in Section 4 of this

3

* * *

  


Agreement. In the event of any transaction which will result in such termination, the Company shall give to the Optionee written notice thereof prior to the effective date of such transaction. Until such effective date, the Optionee may exercise any portion of this Stock Option, but after such effective date, the Optionee may not exercise this Stock Option unless it is assumed or substituted by the successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) as provided above.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5, in the event of a Sale Event pursuant to which holders of the Stock of the Company will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Sale Event, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make or provide for a cash payment to the Optionee in exchange for the cancellation hereof, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the value as determined by the Board of Directors of the consideration payable per share of Common Stock pursuant to the Sale Event (the “Sale Price”) times the number of shares of Stock subject to this Stock Option (to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of this Stock Option.

6. Withholding Taxes. The Optionee is not a U.S. Resident or a U.S. Citizen on the date of Grant, or on the date that this Stock Option vested. The Company agrees to review with tax counsel (agreed to by the Optionee) the appropriate federal, state and local tax withholdings required immediately prior to the Optionee exercising this Stock Option. The Optionee shall, not later than the date as of which the exercise of this Stock Option becomes a taxable event for federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Board of Directors for payment of any federal, state and local taxes required by law to be withheld on account of such taxable event. Subject to approval by the Board of Directors, the Optionee may elect to have such tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by authorizing the Company to withhold from shares of Common Stock to be issued or transferring to the Company, a number of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value that would satisfy the withholding amount due. For purposes of this Section 6 “Fair Market Value” on any given date means the last reported sale price at which Common Stock is traded on such date or, if no Common Stock is traded on such date, the next preceding date on which Common Stock was traded, as reflected on the principal stock exchange or, if applicable, any other national stock exchange on which the Common Stock is traded or admitted to trading. The Optionee and the Executive acknowledge and agree that the Company or any subsidiary of the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind due to the Optionee or the Executive, or from the Option Shares to be issued in respect of an exercise of this Stock Option, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of Option Shares to the Optionee.

7. Representations, warranties and covenants of the Optionee. The Optionee and the Executive each represent, warrant and covenant to the Company, both as of the date hereof and upon exercise of this Stock Option from time to time, as follows:
