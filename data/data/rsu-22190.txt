The Committee may, but shall not be required to, provide at any time for the acceleration of the schedule set forth above.

The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock shall be paid to the Company (i) in cash or its equivalent, (ii) by tendering to the Company shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee having a total Fair Market Value less than or equal to the aggregate purchase price, (iii) to the extent permitted by law, by a “broker cashless exercise” procedure approved by the Committee, or (iv) by a combination of the foregoing methods.

(i) If the Optionee’s termination of employment is due to his/her death or disability (within the meaning of the Company’s long-term disability plan), the Option (to the extent exercisable at the time of the Optionee’s termination of employment) shall be exercisable for a period of twelve months following such termination of employment, and shall thereafter terminate;

(ii) If the Optionee’s termination of employment is by the Company or an Affiliate for Cause, the Option shall terminate on the date of the Optionee’s termination of employment;

(iii) If the Optionee voluntarily terminates his/her employment with the Company and its Affiliates, the Option (to the extent exercisable at the time of the Optionee’s termination) shall be exercisable for a period of 60 days following such termination of employment, and shall thereafter terminate; and

(iv) If the Optionee’s termination of employment is for any other reason, the Option (to the extent exercisable at the time of the Optionee’s termination of employment) shall be exercisable for a period of 60 days following such termination of employment, and shall thereafter terminate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision in this Section 2(e) shall extend the exercise period of an Option beyond its original term set forth in Section 2(b).

(f) Nontransferability. The Option shall not be transferable by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
