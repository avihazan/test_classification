your Options through the IVR or Web system, equals the exercise price for those Option Shares; or  
  
u any lesser number of shares of Stock you desire (or after your death, the person entitled to exercise the Options desires) to use to pay the exercise price for those Option Shares and a check in the amount of such exercise price less the value of the Stock delivered, based on the closing price of the Stock reported on Amex on the day you exercised your Options through the IVR or Web system.  
  
(ii) Mellon will advise you (or any other person who, being entitled to do so, exercises the Options) of the exact number of shares of Stock, valued in accordance with Section 4 of the Plan at the closing price reported on Amex on the effective date of exercise under Section 3(b)(ii), and any funds required to pay in full the exercise price for the Option Shares purchased. In accordance with Section 3(e), you (or such other person) must pay, by check, in shares of Stock or in a combination of check and shares of Stock, any balance required to pay in full the exercise price of the Option Shares purchased within twenty one (21) business days following the confirmation of such exercise of the Options under Section 3(b)(ii).  
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Award Agreement, the Secretary of Mindspeed may limit the number, frequency or volume of successive exercises of any of the Options in which payment is made, in whole or in part, by delivery of shares of Stock pursuant to this subparagraph (d) to prevent unreasonable pyramiding of such exercises.  
  
(e) An exercise conducted and confirmed through the IVR or Web system, whether or not full payment of the exercise price for the Option Shares is received by Mellon, shall constitute a binding contractual obligation by you (or the other person entitled to exercise the Options) to proceed with and complete that exercise of the Options (but only so long as you continue, or the other person entitled to exercise the Options continues, to be entitled to exercise the Options on that date).

If such payment is not made, you (for yourself and on behalf of any other person who becomes entitled to

exercise the Options) authorize Mindspeed, in its discretion, to set off against salary payments or other amounts due or which may become due you (or the other person entitled to exercise the Options) any balance of the exercise price for those Option Shares remaining unpaid thereafter.  
  
(f) A book-entry statement representing the number of Option Shares purchased will be issued as soon as practicable (i) after Mellon has received full payment therefor or (ii) at Mindspeed’s or Mellon’s election in their sole discretion, after Mindspeed or Mellon has received (x) full payment of the exercise price of those Option Shares and (y) any reimbursement in respect of withholding taxes due pursuant to Section 5.  
  
4. Transferability  
  
No Options or portion thereof shall be transferable by you otherwise than (i) by will or by laws of descent and distribution, (ii) by gift to members of your immediate family, (iii) to a trust established for the benefit of your immediate family members only, (iv) to a partnership in which your immediate family members are the only partners or (v) as otherwise determined by the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, “immediate family” shall mean your spouse and natural, adopted or step-children and grandchildren. Notwithstanding any transfer of an Option or portion thereof, the transferred Option shall continue to be subject to the Plan and Award Agreement as were applicable to you immediately prior to the transfer, as if the Option had not been transferred.  
  
5. Withholding  
  
Mindspeed or Mellon shall have the right, in connection with the exercise of the Options in whole or in part, to deduct from any payment to be made by Mindspeed or Mellon under the Plan an amount equal to the taxes required to be withheld by law with respect to such exercise or to require you (or any other person entitled to exercise the Options) to pay to it an amount sufficient to provide for any such taxes so required to be withheld. By your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you agree (for yourself and on behalf of any other person who becomes entitled to exercise the Options) that if Mindspeed or Mellon elects to require you (or such other person) to remit an amount sufficient to pay such withholding taxes, you (or such other person) must remit that amount within twenty one (21) business days after the confirmation of the Option exercise (Section 3(a)(ii)). If such payment is not made, Mindspeed, in its discretion, shall have the same right of set-off with respect to payment of the withholding taxes in connection with the exercise of the Option as provided under Section 3(e) with respect to payment of the exercise price.
