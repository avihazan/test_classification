The Plan was adopted by the Board effective March 15, 1997.

The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado (except their choice-of-law provisions).

# ARTICLE 2\. ADMINISTRATION.

(b) Such requirements as the Internal Revenue Service may establish for outside directors acting under plans intended to qualify for exemption under section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.

The Board may also appoint one or more separate committees of the Board, each composed of one or more directors of the Company who need not satisfy the foregoing requirements, who may administer the Plan with respect to Employees and Consultants who are not considered officers or directors of the Company under section 16 of the Exchange Act, may grant Awards under the Plan to such Employees and Consultants and may determine all terms of such Awards.

2.2 Committee Responsibilities. The Committee shall (a) select the Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants who are to receive Awards under the Plan, (b) determine the type, number, vesting requirements and other features and conditions of such Awards, (c) interpret the Plan and (d) make all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.

Options may be granted in 

2

  


* * *

  


consideration of a cash payment or in consideration of a reduction in the Optionee’s other compensation. A Stock Option Agreement may provide that a new Option will be granted automatically to the Optionee when he or she exercises a prior Option and pays the Exercise Price in the form described in Section 6.2.

5.2 Number of Shares. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the number of Common Shares subject to the Option and shall provide for the adjustment of such number in accordance with Article 9.

The limitations set forth in the preceding sentence shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Article 9.

5.3 Exercise Price. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price; provided that the Exercise Price under an IS0 shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the date of grant and the Exercise Price under an NQO shall in no event be less than 85% of the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the date of grant.

5.4 Exercisability and Term. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the Option is to become exercisable. The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify the term of the Option; provided that the term of an IS0 shall in no event exceed 10 years from the date of grant. A Stock Option Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the Optionee’s death, disability or retirement or other events and may provide for expiration prior to the end of its term in the event of the termination of the Optionee’s service. NQOs may also be awarded in combination with Restricted Shares, and such an Award may provide that the NQOs will not be exercisable unless the related Restricted Shares are forfeited.

5.5 Effect of Change in Control. The Committee may determine, at the time of granting an Option or thereafter, that such Option shall become exercisable as to all or part of the Common Shares subject to such Option in the event that a Change in Control occurs with respect to the Company, subject to the following limitations:

(a) In the case of an ISO, the acceleration of exercisability shall not occur without the Optionee’s written consent.

(b) If the Company and the other party to the transaction constituting a Change in Control agree that such transaction is to be treated as a “pooling of interests” for financial reporting purposes, and if such transaction in fact is so treated, then the acceleration of exercisability shall not occur to the extent that the surviving entity’s independent public accountants determine in good faith that such acceleration would preclude the use of “pooling of interests” accounting.
