e. The following shall apply in the event of any payment or distribution from the Company to the Executive under Section 8 or this Section. 

(i) Excise Tax. If any payment or distribution by the Company to the Executive or for the Executive’s benefit, or the acceleration of the time of any payment or distribution or vesting of any deferred compensation, stock option, restricted stock or other equity grant whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, (a “Payment”) constitutes a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax together with any such interest and penalties are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”) the Company will make an additional payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) to the Executive in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including, any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes) including, without limitation, any federal, state or local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive will retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Payment.

* * *

##### 

(ii) Determination of Gross Up Payment. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (iii) below, all determinations under this Section 17.e., including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, will be made by a national certified public accounting firm (the “Accounting Firm”) selected by the Company. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Executive and the Company within fifteen (15) days after the later of the date of the Change in Control (or any other change in ownership or effective control of the Company that triggers application of the Excise Tax) or the date of the termination of employment of the Executive with the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne solely by the Company. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and to pay any applicable state and local income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the actual reduction in federal income taxes which is reasonably expected to result from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year (determined, however, with regard to limitations on deductions based upon the amount of the Executive’s adjusted gross income). The initial Gross-Up Payment determined pursuant to this paragraph (ii) will be paid to the Executive by the Company within five (5) days after it receives the Accounting Firm’s determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it will furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on Executive’s applicable federal tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the Accounting Firm will be binding on both the Executive and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a result of uncertainty in applying Section 4999 of the Code, it is possible that the Company will not have made Gross-Up Payments that it should have made hereunder (an “Underpayment”). If the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph (iii) hereof and the Executive is thereafter required to pay any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm will determine the amount of the Underpayment, inform the Executive and the Company in writing of the Underpayment, and, within five (5) days of receiving such written report, the Company will pay the amount of such Underpayment to the Executive. 

(iii) Notice and Payment of Excise Tax. The Executive must notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. The Executive must give such notification as soon as practicable but not later than fifteen (15) days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and the notification must apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is required to be paid. The Executive agrees to not pay such claim before the expiration of thirty (30) days following the date on which the Executive give such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing before the expiration of such 30-day period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive 

9

##### 

must (1) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, and (2) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company reasonably requests in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney selected by the Company; provided, however, that the Company will directly pay all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and will indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any tax, including interest and penalties, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. The Company will control all proceedings in connection with such contest and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or to contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any appropriate administrative tribunal or court, as the Company may determine; provided, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company will advance to the Executive the amount of such payment, on an interest-free basis, and will indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any tax, including interest or penalties, imposed with respect to such advance. The Company’s control of the contest will be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive will be entitled to settle or contest any other issue. 

(iv) Refund of Excise Tax. If, after the Executive receives an advance by the Company pursuant to paragraph (iii) hereof, the Executive becomes entitled to receive a refund claimed pursuant to such paragraph (iii), the Executive will (subject to the Company’s complying with the requirements of such paragraph (iii)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest thereon, after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the Executive receives an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to paragraph (iii) hereof, a determination is made that the Executive will not be entitled to any refund claimed pursuant to such paragraph (iii), and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund before the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, the Executive will not be required to repay such advance, and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the required Gross-Up Payment. 

18\. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested to his residence in the case of the Executive, or to its principal office in the case of the Company, or to such other addresses as they may respectively designate in writing. 

19\. Entire Agreement; Waiver. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the employment relationship between Company and the Executive, and supercedes any prior agreements relating to such relationship, including any Change of Control Agreement, and may not be changed orally but only by an agreement in writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought. Waiver of or failure to exercise any rights provided by this Agreement in any respect shall not be deemed a waiver of any further or future rights. 

20\. Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of this Agreement shall bind and inure to benefit of any successor of the Company by reorganization, merger or consolidation, or any assignee of all or substantially all of the Company’s business or properties. The Executive’s rights hereunder are personal to and shall not be transferable nor assignable by the Executive.
