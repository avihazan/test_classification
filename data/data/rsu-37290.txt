    Taxes. 

(a)
    The Employee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of this grant or the vesting of Stock Units hereunder. In the event that the Company or the Employer is required to withhold taxes as a result of the grant or vesting of Stock Units, or subsequent sale of Stock acquired pursuant to such Stock Units, or due upon receipt of dividend equivalent payments, the Employee shall surrender a sufficient number of whole shares of such Stock or make a cash payment at the election of the Company, in its sole discretion, as necessary to cover all applicable required withholding taxes and required social security contributions at the time the restrictions on the Stock Units lapse, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, has established alternative procedures for such payment. The Employee will receive a cash refund for any fraction of a surrendered share or shares of Stock not necessary for required withholding taxes and required social insurance contributions. To the extent that any surrender of Stock or payment of cash or alternative procedure for such payment is insufficient, the Employee authorizes the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct all applicable required withholding taxes and social security contributions from the Employee's compensation.

The Employee shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan or the Employee's receipt of Stock Units that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the benefit described in Section 3 if the Employee fails to comply with the Employee's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
