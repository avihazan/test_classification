If the Shares are not publicly traded, Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Committee using such factors, in its judgment, as are relevant in measuring the value of the Common Stock.

The Company may require the Participant to remit to the Company, at the time of the Tax Date, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax obligations prior to the delivery of the certificates for such Shares, whether or not the Participant is in the employ of the Company at such time. At the option of the Committee or the Board of Directors, the Participant may satisfy such tax obligation in whole or in part by surrendering to the Company shares of Common Stock, including Shares which are not then Unvested Shares, having a Fair Market Value on the day prior to the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (the “Tax Date”), equal to the amount of such obligation. All requests by a Participant to have Shares surrendered for this purpose will be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Board of Directors or the Committee and will be subject to the following restrictions: 

(i) the request must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date; 

(ii) once made, then except as provided below, the request will be irrevocable as to the particular Shares as to which the election is made; 

(iii) all requests will be subject to the consent or disapproval of the Board or the Committee;

(b) If requested by the Company, Participant hereby agrees that sales of Shares subject to this award shall be sold by Participant only through such broker-dealers, each of which is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”) as have been designated by the Company (a “Designated NASD Dealer”) whereby, upon the Participant irrevocably electing to sell a portion of the Shares the Designated NASD Dealer irrevocably commits upon receipt of such Shares to forward directly to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax obligation with respect to the issuance of the Shares. 

(c) The Participant acknowledges that he has been informed of the availability of making an election in accordance with Section 83(b) of the Code; and that the Participant is solely responsible for making such election. 

11\. Representations. Participant has had an opportunity to review with his own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. Participant understands that he (and not the Company) shall be responsible for his own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
