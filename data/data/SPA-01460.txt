WHEREAS, the Debtors and the Investors are seeking to implement a restructuring of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Chapter 11 Plan and the SPBA;

WHEREAS, on June 6, 2013, the Company and the Investors entered into that certain Second Amended and Restated Stock Purchase and Backstop Agreement (as further amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the “SPBA”);

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Chapter 11 Plan and the SPBA, the Company will conduct the Rights Offering;

WHEREAS, in order to facilitate the Rights Offering, pursuant to the SPBA, and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth therein, among other things, each Investor, severally and not jointly, committed to purchase in the Rights Offering such Investor’s pro rata share of the Rights Offering Shares and in exchange for such commitments, among other things, the Company agreed, pursuant to the terms of the Chapter 11 Plan and the SPBA, to pay the Investors the Commitment Fee; and

WHEREAS, in exchange for the Assignee’s agreement to support the Chapter 11 Plan and commitment to purchase Direct Subscription Shares and Unsubscribed Shares on the terms set forth herein, the Investors agree to reduce the Commitment Fee to which they are otherwise entitled under the SPBA and to permit the Company to issue Commitment Fee Shares to the Assignee, on the terms set forth herein. 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

1\. Purchase of Direct Subscription Shares and Unsubscribed Shares; Default. 

1.1 Purchase of Direct Subscription Shares and Unsubscribed Shares. Simultaneously with the Closing under the SPBA, each of the Parties agrees, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the SPBA, that: 

(a) (i) the Company shall reduce the number of Direct Subscription Shares to be sold to each Investor pursuant to Section 1.2 of the SPBA by the number of Direct Subscription Shares set forth below such Investor’s name on the signature pages hereto, (ii) the Company shall, in lieu of selling the aggregate number of such Direct Subscription Shares as determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) to the Investors, sell and deliver such Direct Subscription Shares to the Assignee on the same terms as such Direct Subscription Shares were to be sold and delivered to the Investors, and (iii) the Assignee shall purchase all such Direct Subscription Shares at a price per share equal to the Purchase Price; provided that to the extent that the aggregate number of Direct Subscription Shares changes, the number of Direct Subscription Shares to be sold and delivered to the Assignee under this Section 1.1(a) (as reflected on the signature pages hereto) shall automatically be adjusted to ensure that the Assignee maintains the same proportion of Direct Subscription Shares to be purchased hereunder;

-1-

* * *

(b) if the Investors are required to purchase any Unsubscribed Shares pursuant to Section 1.1(c) of the SPBA, then (i) the Company shall reduce the number of Unsubscribed Shares to be sold to each Investor by the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (A) the total number of Unsubscribed Shares and (B) the Backstop Commitment Percentage set forth below such Investor’s name on the signature pages hereto, (ii) the Company shall, in lieu of selling the aggregate number of such Unsubscribed Shares as determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) to the Investors, sell and deliver such Unsubscribed Shares to the Assignee on the same terms as such Unsubscribed Shares were to be sold and delivered to the Investors, and (iii) the Assignee shall purchase all such Unsubscribed Shares at a price per share equal to the Purchase Price; provided that in no event (X) shall the Assignee be required to purchase Unsubscribed Shares that consist of Rights Offering Shares that an Investor was obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1.1(b) of the SPBA (as such Section 1.1(b) (including Appendix 1 referenced therein) is in effect as of the date hereof, without any subsequent amendment or modification thereto) or (Y) shall the Assignee be required to purchase Unsubscribed Shares under this Section 1.1(b) in an aggregate amount exceeding $66,700,000 (in which case, any excess Unsubscribed Shares shall be purchased by the Investors on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the SBPA); and

(c) if the Assignee complies with its obligations under this Section 1.1 and its obligation to support the Chapter 11 Plan, in each case, in all respects, then (i) the Company shall reduce the number of Commitment Fee Shares to be issued and delivered to each Investor by the number of Commitment Fee Shares set forth below such Investor’s name on the signature pages hereto (and each Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall no longer have any obligation under the SPBA to issue and deliver such Commitment Fee Shares to the Investors), and (ii) the Company shall, in lieu of issuing and delivering the aggregate number of such Commitment Fee Shares as determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) to the Investors, issue and deliver such Commitment Fee Shares to the Assignee on the same terms as such Commitment Fee Shares were to be issued and delivered to the Investors; provided that to the extent that the aggregate number of Commitment Fee Shares changes, the number of Commitment Fee Shares to be issued and delivered to the Assignee under this Section 1.1(c) (as reflected on the signature pages hereto) shall automatically be adjusted to ensure that the Assignee maintains the same proportion of Commitment Fee Shares to be purchased hereunder.

1.2 Default. If the Assignee should default in its obligation to purchase any Direct Subscription Shares or Unsubscribed Shares that it is agreeing to purchase pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.1 (the “Assignee Defaulted Shares”), the Parties agree that:

(a) the Company shall reduce distributions under the Chapter 11 Plan to the Assignee in respect of the DIP Credit Agreement (as defined in the Chapter 11 Plan) in an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price of the Assignee Defaulted Shares, and if the amount of such distributions is less than the aggregate purchase price of the Assignee Defaulted Shares, then additionally, reduce distributions under the Chapter 11 Plan to the Assignee in respect of the Assignee’s Senior Secured Notes Claim (as defined in the Chapter 11 Plan) such that the aggregate amount so reduced equals the aggregate purchase price of the Assignee Defaulted Shares (an “Assignee Default Exchange”) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, upon such reduction in distributions, the Company shall deliver to the Assignee the Assignee Defaulted Shares); and

* * *

(b) in connection with any Assignee Default Exchange, the Assignee hereby constitutes and appoints the Company as the Assignee’s true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in the Assignee’s name, place and stead, with full power of substitution, to execute (i) any agreements, instruments of conveyance and assignment as may be necessary, appropriate, proper, advisable, incidental or convenient to consummate such Assignee Default Exchange (including, without limitation, any amendment to the DIP Credit Agreement, if necessary), and (ii) such related instruments as may be necessary, appropriate, proper, advisable, incidental or convenient to evidence such consummation.
