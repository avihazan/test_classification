4.2 

Without limitation to the generality of other related provisions herein, Manager specifically undertakes not to disclose any information howsoever relating to HOMI Companies’ activity to any third party whatsoever.  
  
4.3 

In addition to the provisions of this Section 4 above, and without derogating therefrom, Manager confirms and agrees that all documents and/or other material which may be given to Manager or otherwise be in Manager’s possession in the context of and/or in the course of and/or as a result of Manager’s employment with Employer, is the property of HOMI Companies and, for as long as such shall be in Manager’s possession, Manager shall look after it in such way as to ensure that no unauthorized use may be made of it. Any and all such documents and/or material shall be returned to Employer by Manager forthwith upon their no longer being need by Manager in furtherance of Manager’s duties herein, or upon Employer’s first demand, whichever comes sooner, without Manager retaining any copy thereof.  
  
4.4 

Manager represents and confirms that Manager is aware and agrees, that Employer and/or other HOMI Companies shall be the owner of all of the rights in and to all of the fruits of Manager’s labor and all of the work product, of any kind whatsoever, that are related and/or that pertain, directly or indirectly, to Manager’s work hereunder (hereinafter: “Work Product”), and Manager undertakes not to make any use whatsoever, at any time whatsoever, of the Work Product, or any part thereof, other than solely for HOMI Companies’ benefit and in the context of Manager’s work for Employer under the terms hereof. For avoidance of doubt, it is hereby stipulated that any and all Work Product, and any and all information relating, directly or indirectly, to any and all Work Product, shall for all intents and purposes be deemed to be Trade Secrets. In the event of any dispute arising between the Parties as to the inclusion of any item within the definition of Work Product as defined above, the burden of proof shall rest with Manager alone, and until such time as Manager may, if at all, convince Employer that it is not Work Product, Manager undertakes to treat it as Work Product, and all the provisions hereof applying to Work Product shall also apply in such case.  
  
4.5 

For avoidance of any doubt, it is hereby stipulated that all Work Product will be the property of Employer and/or HOMI Companies alone, and Manager shall not be entitled to any consideration or benefit, of any kind whatsoever, in connection with such Work Product, over and above Manager’s wages as defined herein, and Employer and HOMI Companies will be entitled to take, or refrain from taking, whatever action they see fit in relation to such Work Product, in their discretion, without the need to provide the reasons behind their decision, or to update Manager as to their decisions. Manager undertakes to sign any document that may be presented to Manager by Employer, such as may reasonably and customarily be required in order to implement and give effect to the provisions of Sections 4.4 and 4.5 above, including, without limitation, assignments and/or transfers of patents, copyright and/or any other similar right.  
  
4.6 

It is acknowledged that Manager will likely become acquainted with sensitive and classified Trade Secrets and Work Product in the course of Manager’s relations with HOMI Companies under this Agreement as mentioned in this Section 4 above. It is further acknowledged that such Trade Secrets and Work Product would give HOMI Companies’ competitors an unfair and unlawful advantage in trade, and that HOMI Companies’ business is based, and fundamentally dependent, on the continued secrecy of such Trade Secrets and Work Product. Such Trade Secrets and Work Product are proprietary to, and owned exclusively by HOMI Companies, and unauthorized disclosure and/or use of such Trade Secrets and/or Work Product would be very likely to cause material damage to HOMI Companies. With all of the foregoing in mind, Manager hereby undertakes, in addition to, and without derogating from Manager’s non-disclosure undertakings, in order to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure and/or use of Trade Secrets and/or Work Product, that Manager will not, at any time during the Term of this Agreement and for a further period of 12 (twelve) months following termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, either personally or by means of any person and/or entity acting on Manager’s behalf and/or howsoever otherwise, directly or indirectly, do any of the following:

Exhibit B’

Effective as of 1st day of January, 2009

To the Individual Employment Agreement (“Agreement”)

Between HOMI Israel Ltd and Jacob Ronnel

dated as of 1 January 2009

Relations Following Termination of Employment

All terms that are capitalized herein and that are defined in the Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Exhibit B’ shall have the meanings given thereto in the Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency or contradiction between the provisions of this Exhibit and the provisions of the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement shall prevail and be binding upon the Parties.

1\. 

Nature of Relations Following End of Employment Relations  
  
1.1 

For a period of twenty-four months following the end of employment relations, for whatever reason, between Employer and Manager (the “Service Period”), Manager undertakes to provide Employer and/or any other of the HOMI Companies, as designated in writing by Employer, with services, in operations and/or sales and/or marketing, as designated in writing by Employer (“Services”).  
  
1.2 

Services will be on an independent contractor basis, without employment relations existing between Manager and any HOMI Company, and the terms included in Sections 2 and 4 of the Agreement shall be deemed to apply to the Services relations between the Parties during the Service Period, mutatis mutandis, provided that the non-compete restriction contained in Section 4.6 of the Agreement shall continue in force for the entire Service Period, and not just for the first 12 months following the end of employment relations.  
  
1.3 

During the first year of Service Period (“Year One”) and during the second year of the Service Period (“Year Two”), Employer may require that 20 hours’ Services will be provided by Manager each month, and Manager undertakes to meet such request.  
  
1.4 

In return for Services provided by Manager during Service Period, and in consideration for the non-compete provisions, which will remain in force for the entire Service Period as stated above, Employer shall pay Manager the sum of $4,500 per month during the Service Period, against due presentation of a tax invoice in Manager’s name.  
  
1.5 

For the duration of Year One, Employer shall pay the sum set forth in Section 1.4 above, whether or not it requests to receive the Services, and shall be exempt from paying such sum (but the non-compete provisions shall remain effective) only if Manager does not supply the Services, even though Employer demanded such services. At any time in Year Two, Employer may elect to cease making such payments, in which case Manager shall, from that point forward, no longer be required to supply Services and no longer be bound by the non-compete restriction contained in Section 4.6 of the Agreement.
