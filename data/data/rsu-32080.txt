1. Grant of Restricted Stock Unit   
  
The Company hereby grants to the Participant the number of shares of Restricted Stock Units (the “Restricted Stock Units”) set forth above on the grant date set forth above (the “Grant Date”). 

2. Vesting of Restricted Stock Unit   
  
This Restricted Stock Unit Award will vest with respect to 34% of the underlying shares on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and with respect to an additional 33% of the underlying shares on each of the second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date of the award. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to the participant prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest, and shall be forfeited by the participant upon the participant’s Termination of Employment, as defined in the Plan, prior to vesting for any reason other than death or Termination of Employment Due to Disability, as defined in the Plan. 

3. Tax and Withholding   
  
Where required pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company will satisfy any federal or local income tax or social tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units by withholding shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be available for delivery upon the vesting of this award having a Fair Market Value, as defined in the Plan, on the date the shares of Restricted Stock Units first become taxable equal to the minimum statutory withholding obligation or such other withholding obligation as required by applicable law with respect to such taxable shares. In other cases, as a condition to the delivery of Shares or 

* * *

the lapse of restrictions related to this Restricted Stock Unit, or in connection with any other event that gives rise to a tax withholding obligation, the Company (i) may deduct or withhold from any payment or distribution to the Participant (whether or not pursuant to the Plan), (ii) will be entitled to require that the Participant remit cash to the Company (through payroll deduction or otherwise) or (iii) may enter into any other suitable arrangements to withhold, in each case, in an amount sufficient to satisfy such withholding obligation. 

4. Forfeiture and Recovery of Restricted Shares   
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the Restricted Stock Units may be forfeited without consideration if the Participant, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, engages in any Prohibited Activities (as defined in Appendix A). 

If the Participant engages in any Prohibited Activities, the Participant shall, at the sole discretion of the Committee, return any shares of Common Stock or forfeit any gain realized in respect of Restricted Stock Units that vested within 12 months prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment (the “Affected Restricted Stock Units”). The gain pursuant to this Section 4 shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the Fair Market Value, on the applicable vesting date, of the shares of Common Stock deemed delivered to the Participant in respect of the Affected Restricted Stock Units (including any dividends and distributions thereon and any shares withheld to cover any portion of the tax withholding obligations). It will be at the Company’s discretion as to whether shares of Common Stock or cash equal to the gain realized in respect of the Affected Restricted Stock Units shall be returned to the Company and such return or reimbursement shall be made by the Participant immediately after demand by the Company, but not later than ten days following such demand. The amount of the gain calculated pursuant to this Section 4 shall not take into account any taxes paid by or withheld from the Participant in respect of the Affected Restricted Stock Units. 

The foregoing provision will be applied in compliance with applicable laws, including without limitation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Participant will be subject to such forfeiture and recovery and reimbursement policies that the Company or any of its Related Companies may establish to comply with such laws from time to time. 

5. Changes In Stock   
  
The Restricted Stock Unit is subject to the adjustment provisions set forth in Sections 4.11, 5.3 and 5.4 of the Plan. 

6. No Guarantee of Employment or Service   
  
This award will not obligate the Company or any Related Company to retain the Participant in its employ or service for any period. 

7. Governing Law; Severability; Choice of Law   
  
This Agreement will be governed by the internal substantive laws, and not the choice of law rules, of the State of New York and construed accordingly, to the extent not superseded by applicable federal law. If any provision of the Agreement is held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or part thereof, each of which will remain in full force and effect. Any action related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of the State of New York, County of Suffolk. The Participant will accept service of process as provided under New York law or by registered mail, return receipt requested, and waive any objection based upon forum non conveniens or as to personal jurisdiction over the Participant in federal or state courts of the State of New York, County of Suffolk. The choice of forum set forth in this Section 7 shall not be deemed to preclude the enforcement of any judgment obtained in such forum in any other jurisdiction.

(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement;

(c) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

(h) in the event that the Participant is not an employee of the Company, the grant of Restricted Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company; and furthermore, the grant of Restricted Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with the Employer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company;

Appendix A 

1. Prohibited Activities. The Participant recognizes that the Company is engaged in a highly competitive business and that its customer, employee, licensee, supplier and financial relationships are of a highly sensitive nature. As a reasonable means to protect the Company’s Confidential Information (as defined in the subclause (a) below), investment, relationships, and goodwill, and in consideration for this Restricted Stock Unit grant, the Participant agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Participant will not, either during his or her employment or for a period of 12 months following the termination of his or her employment (or such longer period specified below) for any reason engage in any of the following “Prohibited Activities”:   
  
(a) Engage in any business activity in a Restricted Area that competes with the business activities of the Company and its corporate affiliates about which Participant either had (i) a job responsibility to promote, or (ii) access to Confidential Information. “Restricted Area” for purposes of this Agreement, means a geographic area that the Participant served or covered on behalf of the Company at any time within the 18 months preceding the end of his or her employment with the Company. “Confidential Information,” for the purposes of this Agreement, means information, including information that is conceived or developed by the Participant that is not generally known to the public and that is used by the Company in connection with its business. By way of example, the term “Confidential Information” would include: trade secrets; processes; formulas; research data; program documentation; algorithms; source codes; object codes; know-how; improvements; inventions; techniques; training materials and methods; product information; corporate strategy; sales forecast and pipeline information; research and development; plans or strategies for marketing and pricing; and information concerning existing or potential customers, partners, or vendors. The Participant understands that this list is not all-inclusive and merely serves as examples of the types of information that falls within the definition of Confidential Information.   
  
(b) Solicit, call on, service or induce others to solicit, call on or service any “Customer” for the purpose of inducing it to license or lease a product or provide it with services that compete with a product or service offered by the Company. A “Customer,” for purposes of this Agreement, means any person or business entity that licensed or leased a Company product or obtained Company services within the 18 months preceding the end of the Participant’s employment with the Company and that the Participant had solicited, called on, or served on the Company’s behalf anytime within that 18-month time period.   
  
(c) Solicit, call on, or induce others to solicit or call on, any “Prospective Customer” for the purpose of inducing it to license or lease a product or provide it with services which compete with a product or service offered by the Company. A “Prospective Customer,” for purposes of this Agreement, is any person or business entity that the Participant solicited or called on (whether directly or through another Company agent at the Participant’s direction) on behalf of the Company anytime within the 12 months preceding the end of the Participant’s employment with the Company.   
  
(d) Directly or indirectly through others, hire any employee or contractor of the Company, or solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any Company employee or contractor to leave the Company for any reason.   
  
* * *

(e) For any period following the termination of the Participant’s employment, violate a non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Related Company (including, without limitation, the Employment and Confidentiality Agreement signed at or around the time of the Participant’s hire).   
  
Different restrictions apply if, at or prior to termination, the Participant was or had been a programmer, software engineer, analyst, support technician, quality assurance technician, technical documentation writer and/or a manager in a research and development capacity. If so, then the Participant’s obligations under this Paragraph 1 shall be satisfied if the Participant does not, for one year following Termination of Employment for any reason, work on any program or product which may be competitive with any program or product of the Company with which the Participant was involved in a research and development or support capacity anytime within the 18 months preceding the end of the Participant’s employment with the Company. 

2. Tolling of Covenants in the Event of Breach. In the event the Participant engages in any of the Prohibited Activities, the time period of the violated covenant(s) shall be tolled throughout the duration of any violation and shall continue until the Participant has complied with such covenant(s) for a period of 12 consecutive full months.   
  
3. Injunction. The Participant acknowledges that, by virtue of the Participant’s employment with the Company, the Participant will have access to Confidential Information of the Company, the disclosure of which will irreparably harm the Company. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company will suffer irreparable harm if the Participant breaches any of the Participant’s obligations under this Agreement. Therefore, the Participant agrees that the Company will be entitled, in addition to its other rights, to enforce the Participant’s obligations through an injunction or decree of specific performance from a court having proper jurisdiction. Any claims the Participant may assert against the Company shall not constitute a defense in any injunction action brought by the Company to force the Participant to keep the promises the Participant made in this Agreement.   
  
4. Authorization to Modify Restrictions. The Participant agrees that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable. However, if any court having proper jurisdiction holds a particular restriction to be unreasonable, that restriction shall be modified only to the extent necessary in the court’s opinion to make it reasonable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement including without limitation Appendix A shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The other provisions of this Agreement are likewise severable.   
  
5. General.   
  
(a) The Participant understands and agrees that, if the Company is successful in a suit or proceeding to enforce any of the terms of this Agreement, the Participant will pay the Company’s costs of bringing such suit or proceeding, including its reasonable attorney’s fees and litigation expenses (including expert witness and deposition expenses).   
  
(b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by the Company, its successors and assigns. This Agreement is personal to the Participant and the Participant may not assign it.   
  
(c) The Company’s rights under this Agreement shall be in addition to any rights it may have under any other Agreement with Participant.   
  
* * *

(d) Any failure to enforce the terms of this Agreement with any other employee of the Company shall not be deemed a waiver by the Company to enforce its rights under this Agreement. Further, any waiver by the Company of any breach by the Participant of any provision of this Agreement, shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach hereof.
