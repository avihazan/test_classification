b. Holder Indemnity. The Holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, its counsel, officers, directors and representatives, any underwriter (as defined in the 1933 Act) and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the underwriter (within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law, and the Company shall reimburse each such Holder, affiliate, officer or director or partner, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action; insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions and respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any statements or information provided by the Holder to the Company expressly for use in connection with the offer or sale of Registerable Securities.

  


c. Notice; Right to Defend. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 5 deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and if the indemnifying party agrees in writing that it will be responsible for any costs, expenses, judgments, damages and losses incurred by the indemnified party with respect to such claim, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if the indemnified party reasonably believes that representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Agreement only if and to the extent that such failure is prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, and the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Agreement.

d. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the responsibility of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relevant fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount the Holder shall be obligated to contribute pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such Holder of the Registerable Securities sold pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute (less the aggregate amount of any damages which the Holder has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of such Registerable Securities).

  


e. Survival of Indemnity. The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall be a continuing right to indemnification and shall survive the registration and sale of any Registerable Securities by any person entitled to indemnification hereunder and the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

  


6\. Remedies.

  


a. Time is of Essence. The Company agrees that time is of the essence of each of the covenants contained herein and that, in the event of a dispute hereunder, this Agreement is to be interpreted and construed in a manner that will enable the Holder to sell its Registerable Securities as quickly as possible after the Holder has indicated to the Company that they desire its Registerable Securities to be registered. Any delay on the part of the Company not expressly permitted under this Agreement, whether material or not, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

  


b. Remedies Upon Default or Delay. The Company acknowledges the breach of any part of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Holder and that monetary damages alone may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that the Holder shall be entitled to injunctive relief or such other applicable remedy as a court of competent jurisdiction may provide. Nothing contained herein will be construed to limit the Holder's right to any remedies at law, including recovery of damages for breach of any part of this Agreement.
