LIONS GATE LIGHTING CORP.

  


Article 3

SHARES

  


  


Section 1.01 Number and Classes. The total number of shares of authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of one hundred million (100,000,000) shares of Common stock, par value $0.001 per share.

  


Section 1.02 Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each of which is to have a distinctive designation specified in the resolution of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such Preferred Stock from time to time. Each series of Preferred Stock:

  
  
  
(a)

may have such number of shares;  
  
  
  
  
(b)

may have such voting powers, full or limited;  
  
  
  
  
(c)

may be subject to redemption upon such terms and conditions;  
  
  
  
  
(d)

may be entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-cumulative) payable in cash, property, rights or securities at such rate or rates, on such conditions, from such date or dates, and at such times, and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable or any other class or series of stock;  
  
  
  
  
(e)

may have such rights and preferences upon the dissolution of liquidation (whether voluntary or involuntary) of the Corporation;  
  
  
  
  
(f)

may be made convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, or cash, or other property or rights at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange, and with such adjustments;  
  
  
  
  
(g)

may be entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund to be applied to the redemption of shares of such series upon such terms and in such amount or amounts;  
  
  
  
  
(h)

may be subject to such restrictions as to issuance or as to the powers, preferences or rights of any such other series; and  
  
  
  
  
(i)

may have such other preferences and relative rights;  
  
  


as in such instance is stated in the resolution of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such Preferred Stock. Except where otherwise set forth in such resolution or resolutions, the number of shares comprising such series may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding from time to time) by like action of the Board of Directors. Shares of any series of Preferred Stock, which have been redeemed (whether through the operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) by the Corporation, or which, if convertible or exchangeable, have been converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of any other class, will have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of the series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock created by resolution of resolutions of the Board of Directors or as part of any other series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the conditions or restriction on issuance set forth in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock and to any filing required by law.
