The Performance Units are subject to the following terms and conditions: 

1\. Relationship to the Plan.

This grant of Performance Units is subject to all of the terms, conditions and provisions of the Plan and administrative interpretations thereunder, if any, that have been adopted by the Committee. Except as defined herein (including in Paragraph 14 of this Award Agreement), capitalized terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them under the Plan. To the extent that any provision of this Award Agreement conflicts with the express terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control and, if necessary, the applicable provisions of this Award Agreement shall be hereby deemed amended so as to carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan. References to the Participant also include the heirs or other legal representatives of the Participant. 

2\. Determination of Payout Percentage. As soon as practical following the close of the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle, the Committee shall determine the TSR Percentile Ranking. Thereafter, the Committee shall determine the Payout Percentage as follows: 

(a) If the TSR Percentile Ranking is at or below the 25th percentile, the Payout Percentage shall be zero. 

(b) If the TSR Percentile Ranking is above the 25th percentile, the Payout Percentage shall be equal to or less than the TSR Percentile Ranking multiplied by 2. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the TSR calculated for the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle is negative, then the Payout Percentage shall not exceed 100%. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee has sole and absolute authority and discretion to reduce the Payout Percentage as it may deem appropriate. 

3\. Vesting of Performance Units. Unless the Participant’s right to the Performance Units is previously forfeited or vested in accordance with Paragraphs 4, 5, 6, or 7, following the Committee’s determinations pursuant to Paragraph 2, the Participant shall vest in and be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of Performance Units granted hereunder and (ii) the Payout Value. Such cash payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Committee’s determination under Paragraph 2 and, in any event, on or before March 15, 2013. If, in accordance with the Committee’s

determination under Paragraph 2, the Payout Value is zero, the Participant shall immediately forfeit any and all rights to the Performance Units. Upon the vesting and/or forfeiture of the Performance Units pursuant to this Paragraph 3 and the making of the related cash payment, if any, the rights of the Participant and the obligations of the Corporation under this Award Agreement shall be satisfied in full.

In the event of the Retirement of the Participant on or after March 31, 2012, the Participant’s Performance Units may be considered for vesting following the close of the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle. At the discretion of the Committee, the Participant may vest in and be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the percentage equal to the days of Participant’s Employment during the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle divided by the total days in the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle, (ii) the number of Performance Units granted hereunder, and (iii) the Payout Value. Such cash payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Committee’s determination under Paragraph 2 and, in any event, during the calendar year following the close of the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle. If, in accordance with the Committee’s determination under Paragraph 2, the Payout Value is zero, the Participant shall immediately forfeit any and all rights to the Performance Units. Upon the vesting and/or forfeiture of the Performance Units pursuant to this Paragraph 6 and the making of the related cash payment, if any, the rights of the Participant and the obligations of the Corporation under this Award Agreement shall be satisfied in full. The death of the Participant following Retirement but prior to the close of the July 2011 – December 2012 Performance Cycle shall have no effect on this Paragraph 6. 

7\. Vesting Upon a Change of Control.
