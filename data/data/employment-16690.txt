WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Executive and to enter into an agreement embodying the terms of such employment; and

WHEREAS, Executive is willing to accept such employment on the terms hereinafter set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:

Employment Term. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the term of Executive's employment under this Agreement shall commence on January 18, 2011 (the “Effective Date”) and end on the second anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Employment Term”). The Employment Term shall terminate upon termination of Executive's employment as set forth in Section 7. Additionally, if not terminated pursuant to Section 7, or by either party by delivery of written notice to the other party (delivered not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the initial Employment Term) of its desire not to renew the Employment Term, the Employment Term shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year renewal period (i.e., a third year) which period shall be considered part of the "Employment Term." Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a notice of non-renewal of the Employment Term by either party or the termination of Executive's employment upon or following the subsequent expiration of the Employment Term constitute a termination of Executive's employment by the Company without Cause (as defined below) or by Executive for Good Reason (as defined below).  
  
(b)

Executive Representation. Executive hereby represents to the Company that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Executive and the Company and the performance by Executive of the Executive’s duties hereunder shall not constitute a breach of, or otherwise contravene, the terms of any employment agreement or other agreement or policy to which Executive is a party or otherwise bound.

* * *

(e)

Resignation as Officer or Director. Upon a termination of Executive’s employment hereunder, unless requested otherwise by the Company, Executive shall resign each position (if any) that Executive then holds as an officer or director of the Company or of any of its affiliates.  
  
8.

Non-Interference/Non-Solicitation. Executive acknowledges and recognizes that in the course of performing services for the Company, Executive will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its affiliates that is extremely valuable to the Company and its affiliates and is not known to the general public. Accordingly, Executive agrees as follows:  
  
(a)

Executive agrees that during the term of employment and until the first anniversary of the date of termination of Executive's employment with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be (the "Restricted Period"), the Executive will not directly or indirectly, use any Company Confidential Information (as defined in Section 9) to interfere with business relationships (whether formed before or after the date of this Agreement) between the Company or any of its affiliates and customers, suppliers, partners, members or investors of the Company or its affiliates.  
  
(b)

Executive further agrees that during the Restricted Period, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or encourage any employee of the Company or its affiliates to leave the employment of the Company or its affiliates, or (ii) solicit or encourage to cease to work with the Company or its affiliates any consultant then under contract with the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that general advertising not directed specifically at employees of the Company or any affiliate shall not be deemed to violate this Section 8(b).  
  
(c)

It is expressly understood and agreed that although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 8 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that any restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Executive, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.  
  
9.

Confidentiality. Executive will not at any time (whether during or after Executive's employment with the Company) disclose or use for Executive's own benefit or purposes or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing

* * *

processes, financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally, or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company (“Company Confidential Information”); provided that the foregoing shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of Executive's breach of this covenant; provided further that the foregoing shall not apply when Executive is required to divulge, disclose or make accessible such information by a court of competent jurisdiction or an individual duly appointed thereby, by any administrative bo dy or legislative body (including a committee thereof) having supervisory authority over the business of the Company, or by any administrative body or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with jurisdiction to order Executive to divulge, disclose or make accessible such information. Executive agrees that upon termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business of the Company and its affiliates and/or containing any Company Confidential Information, except that he may retain personal notes, notebooks and diaries that do not contain Company Confidential Information of the type described in the preceding sentence. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use for Executive's account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary business designation us ed or owned in connection with the business of the Company or its affiliates.  
  
10.

Specific Performance. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 8 or Section 9 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, shall be entitled to cease making any payments or providing any benefit otherwise required by this Agreement and obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.  
  
11.

Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. During the Employment Term and at all relevant times, the Company shall maintain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy of a commercially reasonable amount for a company of similar size and risk exposure as the Company.

(c)

The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered a waiver of such party’s rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.  
  
(d)

Withholding Taxes. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  
  
(i)

Section 409A. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to the extent subject thereto, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the Executive has incurred a “separation from service” from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following an Executive’s separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive’s separation from service (or, if earlier, the Executive’s date of death). To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurr ed and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to Executive) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment.  
  
(j)

Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
