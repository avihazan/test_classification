During any period prior to such termination during which Executive is absent from the full-time performance of Executive’s duties with the Company due to Disability, the Company shall continue to pay Executive’s Base Salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of such period of Disability, offset by any amounts payable to Executive under any disability insurance plan or policy provided by the Company.

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s payment of severance benefits described in this Section 1(d) constitutes good and valuable consideration for such release. As used herein, “Good Reason” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without Executive’s prior written consent: (A) the Company’s material breach of any material provision of this Agreement, (B) the material reduction in Executive’s title, duties, reporting responsibilities or level of responsibilities as General Counsel of the Company, excluding for this purpose any such reduction that is an isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith or that is authorized pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the reduction in Executive’s Base Salary or the percentage of Executive’s discretionary annual target bonus, or (D) the relocation of Executive’s principal place of employment more than 50 miles outside the Seattle metropolitan area, provided that in no event shall Executive’s resignation be for “Good Reason” unless (x) an event or circumstance set forth in clauses (A) through (D) shall have occurred and Executive provides the Company with written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after the Executive has knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, which notice specifically identifies the event or circumstance that Executive believes constitutes Good Reason, (y) the Company fails to correct the circumstance or event so identified within 30 days after the receipt of such notice, and (z) the Executive resigns within 90 days after the date of delivery of the notice referred to in clause (x) above.

practice or program of or any other contract or agreement with the Company or its affiliates in accordance with the terms thereof. 

2\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; NON-SOLICITATION; AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. 

(a) CONFIDENTIALITY. Executive acknowledges that while employed by the Company, Executive will occupy a position of trust and confidence. Executive shall not, except as is appropriate to perform Executive’s duties hereunder or as required by applicable law, disclose to others, use, copy, transmit, reproduce, summarize, quote or make commercial, whether directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information. Executive will also take reasonable steps to safeguard such Confidential Information and prevent its loss, theft, or inadvertent disclosure to third persons. This Section 2 shall apply to Confidential Information acquired by Executive whether prior or subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. “Confidential Information” shall mean information about the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and their respective clients and customers, including (without limitation) any proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, data, formulae, information and client and customer lists and all papers, resumes, and records (including computer records) of the documents containing such Confidential Information, provided that Confidential Information shall not mean any such information that is previously disclosed to, or in possession of, the public other than by reason of Executive’s breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if Executive is required to disclose any such confidential or proprietary information pursuant to applicable law or a subpoena or court order, Executive shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any such requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions hereof. Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain such a protective order or other remedy. If such order or other remedy is not obtained prior to the time Executive is required to make the disclosure, or the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, Executive shall disclose only that portion of the confidential or proprietary information which he is advised by counsel that he is legally required to so disclose. Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that such information gives the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates a competitive advantage. Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at the Company’s request at any time or upon termination or expiration of Executive’s employment or as soon thereafter as possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates or prepared by Executive in the course of Executive’s employment by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates. As used in this Agreement, “affiliates” shall mean any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company. 

(b) DUTY OF LOYALTY. In consideration of the Company’s promise to disclose, and disclosure of, its Confidential Information and other good and valuable consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Executive, Executive hereby agrees and covenants that: Until the longer of (i) the last day of the Term and (ii) a period of twenty four (24) months beyond Executive’s date of termination of employment for any reason, including the expiration of the Term (the “Restricted Period”), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in, assist or become associated with a Competitive Activity. For purposes of this Section 2(b): (i) a “Competitive Activity” means, at the time of Executive’s termination, any business or other endeavor in any jurisdiction of a kind being conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (or demonstrably anticipated by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates), including, without limitation, those that are engaged in the provision of any

lodging or travel related services (including, without limitation, corporate travel services), in any jurisdiction as of the Effective Date or at any time thereafter (such affiliates including, without limitation, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Inc. and TripAdvisor); and (ii) Executive shall be considered to have become “associated with a Competitive Activity” if Executive becomes directly or indirectly involved as an owner, principal, employee, officer, director, independent contractor, representative, stockholder, financial backer, agent, partner, advisor, lender, or in any other individual or representative capacity with any individual, partnership, corporation or other organization that is engaged in a Competitive Activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may make and retain investments during the Restricted Period, for investment purposes only, in less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly-traded corporation engaged in a Competitive Activity if stock of such corporation is either listed on a national stock exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System if Executive is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation. 

(c) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Executive agrees that during the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, hire, recruit or solicit the employment or services of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor), any employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any such person who has terminated his or her relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates within the six-month period prior to such hiring, recruiting or soliciting (except for (i) such employment or hiring by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or (ii) such employment or hiring by Executive of an agent, consultant or independent contractor where the primary duties of such person are not for the Company); provided, however that a general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target, or does not have the effect of targeting, any employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. This Section 2(c) shall not apply to any administrative assistant working directly for Executive. 

(d) NON-SOLICITATION OF BUSINESS PARTNERS. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, persuade or encourage or attempt to persuade or encourage any business partners or business affiliates of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates to cease doing business with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or to engage in any business competitive with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates on its own or with any competitor of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates. 

(e) PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; ASSIGNMENT. All Executive Developments (as defined below) shall be made for hire by Executive for the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. “Executive Developments” means any idea, discovery, invention, design, method, technique, improvement, enhancement, development, computer program, machine, algorithm or other work or authorship, in each case, (i) that (A) relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or (B) results from or is suggested by any undertaking assigned to Executive or work performed by Executive for or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether created alone or with others, during or after working hours and (ii) that is conceived or developed during the Term. All Confidential Information and all Executive Developments shall remain the sole property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Executive shall acquire no proprietary interest in any Confidential Information or Executive Developments developed or acquired during the Term. To the extent Executive may, by operation of law or otherwise,

##### 

acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information or Executive Development, Executive hereby assigns to the Company all such proprietary rights. Executive shall, both during and after the Term, upon the Company’s request, promptly execute and deliver to the Company all such assignments, certificates and instruments, and shall promptly perform such other acts, as the Company may from time to time in its reasonable discretion deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, perfect, enforce or defend the Company’s rights in Confidential Information and Executive Developments. 

(f) COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. During the Term, Executive shall adhere to the policies and standards of professionalism set forth in the Company’s Policies and Procedures as they may exist from time to time. Executive hereby consents to, and expressly authorizes, the Company’s use of Executive’s name and likeness in trade publications and other media for trade or commercial purposes. 

(g) REMEDIES FOR BREACH. Executive expressly agrees and understands that the Company will have 30 days from receipt of Executive’s notice of any alleged breach by the Company of this Agreement to cure any such breach. Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of this Section 2 will be inadequate and that damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon Executive’s violation or threatened violation of any provision of this Section 2, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction immediate injunctive relief and obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach as well as an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such violation without the requirement of posting any bond. Nothing in this Section 2 shall be deemed to limit the Company’s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 2, which may be pursued by or available to the Company. 

(h) SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Section 2 shall, to the extent provided in this Section 2, survive the termination or expiration of Executive’s employment with the Company and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 2 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state. 

3\. TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS/EXISTING CLAIMS. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has made, and is not making, and in executing this Agreement, Executive has not relied upon, any representations, promises or inducements except to the extent the same is expressly set forth in this Agreement. Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not party to any contract, understanding, agreement or policy, whether or not written, with Executive’s most-recent employer (the “Previous Employer”) or otherwise, that would be breached by Executive’s entering into, or performing services under, this Agreement. Executive further represents that, prior to the Effective Date, he has disclosed in writing to the Company all material existing, pending or threatened claims against him, if any, as a result of his employment with the Previous Employer or his membership on any boards of directors.

This Agreement shall not be modified in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto. 

8\. SEVERABILITY. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement. 

9\. SECTION 409A. If any compensation or benefits provided by this Agreement may result in the application of Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall, in consultation with the Executive, modify the Agreement in the least restrictive manner necessary in order to exclude such compensation from the definition of “deferred compensation” within the meaning of such Section 409A or in order to comply with the provisions of Section 409A, other applicable provision(s) of the Code and/or any rules, regulations or other regulatory guidance issued under such statutory provisions and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Executive.
